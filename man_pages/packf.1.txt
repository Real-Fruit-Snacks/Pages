NAME

packf - pack
messages in nmh folder into a single file

SYNOPSIS

packf

[-help] [-version]
[+folder] [msgs] [-file name]
[-mbox] [-mmdf]

DESCRIPTION

packf
will pack copies of messages from a folder, into a single
file.

If the
-mbox switch is given (the default), then the
messages are separated using mbox (uucp) style delimiters.
This is the format used by most mail clients (elm, mailx,
etc.).

If the
-mmdf switch is given, then the messages are
separated by mmdf style delimiters. Each message in the file
is separated by four CTRL-A&rsquo;s and a newline.

You may specify
the name of the file in which to pack messages with the
-file name switch. If you do not specify the
name of the file, it will default to
&ldquo;msgbox&rdquo;.

If the given
file name points to an existing file, then the specified
messages will be appended to the end of the file, otherwise
the file will be created and the messages appended.

packf
makes an mbox-style delimiter by examining the first line of
the message. If the first line is a
&ldquo;Return-Path&rdquo; field, its address and the current
date and time are used. Otherwise, if the first line has an
&ldquo;X-Envelope-From&rdquo; field, its contents (which
should already be in the correct format) are used.
Otherwise, a dummy address and the current date and time are
used.

Messages that
are packed by packf can be unpacked using
inc.
