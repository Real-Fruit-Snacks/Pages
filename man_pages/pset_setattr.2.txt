NAME

pset_setattr,
pset_getattr &minus; set or get processor set attributes

SYNOPSIS

#include

int
pset_setattr(psetid_t pset, uint_t
attr);

int
pset_getattr(psetid_t pset, uint_t
*attr);

DESCRIPTION

The
pset_setattr() function sets attributes of the
processor set specified by pset. The bitmask of
attributes to be set or cleared is specified by
attr.

The
pset_getattr function returns attributes of the processor
set specified by pset. On successful return,
attr will contain the bitmask of attributes for the
specified processor set.

The value of
the attr argument is the bitwise inclusive-OR of
these attributes, defined in :

PSET_NOESCAPE

Unbinding of LWPs from the
processor set with this attribute requires superuser
privileges.

The binding of
LWPs and processes to processor sets is controlled by
pset_bind(2). When PSET_NOESCAPE attribute is
cleared, a process calling pset_bind() can clear the
processor set binding of any LWP whose real or effective
user ID matches its own real of effective user ID. Setting
PSET_NOESCAPE attribute forces pset_bind() to
require superuser privileges for such an operation.

RETURN VALUES

Upon successful
completion, these functions return 0. Otherwise, -1 is
returned and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS

These function
will fail if: 
EFAULT

The location pointed to by
attr was not writable by the user.

EINVAL

An invalid processor set ID was
specified.
