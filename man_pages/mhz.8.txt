NAME

mhz - calulate
processor clock rate

SYNOPSIS

mhz
[-c]

DESCRIPTION

mhz
calculates the processor clock rate and megahertz. It uses
an unrolled, interlocked loop of adds or shifts. So far,
superscalarness has been defeated on the tested processors
(SuperSPARC, RIOS, Alpha).

OUTPUT

Output format
is either just the clock rate as a float (-c) or more
verbose

39.80 Mhz,
25 nanosec clock

mhz is
described more completely in &rsquo;&rsquo;mhz: Anatomy of a
microbenchmark&rsquo;&rsquo; in Proceedings of 1998
USENIX Annual Technical Conference , June 1998.
