NAME
       Font::TTF::Segarr - Segmented array

DESCRIPTION
       Holds data either directly or indirectly as a series of arrays. This
       class looks after the set of arrays and masks the individual sub-
       arrays, thus saving a class, we hope.

INSTANCE VARIABLES
       All instance variables do not start with a space.

       The segmented array is simply an array of segments

       Each segment is a more complex affair:

       START
           In terms of the array, the address for the 0th element in this
           segment.

       LEN Number of elements in this segment

       VAL The array which contains the elements

METHODS
   Font::TTF::Segarr->new($size)
       Creates a new segmented array with a given data size

   $s->fastadd_segment($start, $is_sparse, @dat)
       Creates a new segment and adds it to the array assuming no overlap
       between the new segment and any others in the array. $is_sparse
       indicates whether the passed in array contains "undef"s or not. If
       false no checking is done (which is faster, but riskier). If equal to 2
       then 0 is considered undef as well.

       Returns the number of segments inserted.

   $s->add_segment($start, $overwrite, @dat)
       Creates a new segment and adds it to the array allowing for possible
       overlaps between the new segment and the existing ones. In the case of
       overlaps, elements from the new segment are deleted unless $overwrite
       is set in which case the elements already there are over-written.

       This method also checks the data coming in to see if it is sparse (i.e.
       contains undef values). Gaps cause new segments to be created or not to
       over-write existing values.

   $s->tidy
       Merges any immediately adjacent segments

   $s->at($addr, [$len])
       Looks up the data held at the given address by locating the appropriate
       segment etc. If $len > 1 then returns an array of values, spaces being
       filled with undef.

   $s->remove($addr, [$len])
       Removes the item or items from addr returning them as an array or the
       first value in a scalar context. This is very like "at", including
       padding with undef, but it deletes stuff as it goes.

   $s->copy
       Deep copies this array

   $s->copy_seg($seg)
       Creates a deep copy of a segment

BUGS
       No known bugs.
