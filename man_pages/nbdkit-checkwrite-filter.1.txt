NAME

nbdkit-checkwrite-filter
- check writes match contents of plugin

SYNOPSIS

nbdkit
--filter=checkwrite PLUGIN

DESCRIPTION

"nbdkit-checkwrite-filter"
is an nbdkit filter that turns write operations into checks
that what is written matches the existing content of the
plugin. If the content matches then the write operation
succeeds (doing nothing). If not then the write operation
fails returning EIO Input/output error.

The purpose of
this filter is to test copying tools as described below.

The underlying
plugin is opened read-only and is never written to. All
write-like operations are covered by this filter, such as
trimming and zeroing. This filter tests the logical
equivalence of the writes, ignoring differences in
sparseness.

Using this
filter to test copying tools 
You can check that a copying tool is copying data correctly
by creating an nbdkit instance containing some test data,
overlaying this filter, and copying from and to nbdkit at
the same time:

nbdkit
--filter=checkwrite data "@32768 1" \ 
--run 'nbdcopy "$uri" "$uri"'

nbdkit
--filter=checkwrite file disk.img \ 
--run 'nbdcopy "$uri" "$uri"'

nbdkit
--filter=checkwrite linuxdisk testdir/ \ 
--run 'qemu-img convert -n "$uri"
"$uri"'

If the copying
program is buggy then you will see EIO errors and (if the
copying program also handles errors correctly) it should
exit with an error.

Other
plugins for testing NBD tools 
If you are doing this kind of testing you will also want to
look at nbdkit-random-plugin(1) and
nbdkit-sparse-random-plugin(1). These plugins already
have this behaviour built in to them (because it is more
efficient to build it into the plugin) &mdash; you do
not need to use this filter with those plugins. This
filter is useful for testing with arbitrary plugins.

PARAMETERS

There are no
parameters specific to this filter. Parameters are passed
through to the underlying plugin.
