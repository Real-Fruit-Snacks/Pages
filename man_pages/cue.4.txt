SYNOPSIS

To compile this driver into the

configuration file:

device uhci

device ohci

DESCRIPTION

The cue driver provides
support for USB Ethernet adapters based on the Computer
Access Technology Corporation&rsquo;s USB-EL1210A
chipset.

The USB-EL1210A
supports a 512-bit multicast hash filter, single perfect
filter entry for the station address and promiscuous mode.
Packets are received and transmitted over separate USB bulk
transfer endpoints.

The CATC chipset
supports only 10Mbps half-duplex mode, hence there are no
ifmedia(4) modes to select.

For more
information on configuring this device, see ifconfig(8).
