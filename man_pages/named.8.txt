[-C] [-d debug-level] [-D string]

[-u user] [-v] [-V] ]

DESCRIPTION

named is
a Domain Name System (DNS) server, part of the BIND 9
distribution from ISC. For more information on the DNS, see
RFC 1033, - RFC 1034, and RFC 1035.

When invoked
without arguments, named reads the default
configuration file /etc/bind/named.conf, reads any
initial data, and listens for queries.

OPTIONS

-4

This option tells named
to use only IPv4, even if the host machine is capable of
IPv6. -4 and -6 are mutually exclusive.

-6

This option tells named to use only IPv6, even if
the host machine is capable of IPv4. -4 and -6
are mutually exclusive.

-c config-file

This option tells named
to use config-file as its configuration file instead
of the default, /etc/bind/named.conf. To ensure that
the configuration file can be reloaded after the server has
changed its working directory due to to a possible
directory option in the configuration file,
config-file should be an absolute pathname.

-C

This option prints out the default built-in
configuration and exits.

NOTE: This is
for debugging purposes only and is not an accurate
representation of the actual configuration used by
named at runtime.

-d debug-level

This option sets the daemon's
debug level to debug-level. Debugging traces from
named become more verbose as the debug level
increases.

-D string

This option specifies a string
that is used to identify a instance of named in a
process listing. The contents of string are not
examined.

-E engine-name

When applicable, this option
specifies the hardware to use for cryptographic operations,
such as a secure key store used for signing.

When BIND 9 is
built with OpenSSL, this needs to be set to the OpenSSL
engine identifier that drives the cryptographic accelerator
or hardware service module (usually pkcs11).

-f

This option runs the server in the foreground (i.e., do
not daemonize).

-F

This options turns on FIPS (US Federal Information
Processing Standards) mode if the underlying crytographic
library supports running in FIPS mode.

-g

This option runs the server in the foreground and forces
all logging to stderr.

-L logfile

This option sets the log to the
file logfile by default, instead of the system
log.

-M option

This option sets the default
(comma-separated) memory context options. The possible flags
are:

&bull;

fill: fill blocks of memory with tag values when
they are allocated or freed, to assist debugging of memory
problems; this is the implicit default if named has
been compiled with --enable-developer.

&bull;

nofill: disable the behavior enabled by
fill; this is the implicit default unless
named has been compiled with
--enable-developer. 

-m flag

This option turns on memory
usage debugging flags. Possible flags are usage,
trace, record, size, and mctx.
These correspond to the ISC_MEM_DEBUGXXXX flags
described in .

-n #cpus

This option creates
#cpus worker threads to take advantage of multiple
CPUs. If not specified, named tries to determine the
number of CPUs present and creates one thread per CPU. If it
is unable to determine the number of CPUs, a single worker
thread is created.

-p value

This option specifies the
port(s) on which the server will listen for queries. If
value is of the form  or
dns=, the server will listen for DNS
queries on portnum; if not not specified, the default
is port 53. If value is of the form
tls=, the server will listen for TLS
queries on portnum; the default is 853. If
value is of the form https=,
the server will listen for HTTPS queries on portnum;
the default is 443. If value is of the form
http=, the server will listen for HTTP
queries on portnum; the default is 80.

-s

This option writes memory usage statistics to
stdout on exit.

NOTE:

This option is mainly of
interest to BIND 9 developers and may be removed or changed
in a future release.

-t directory

This option tells named
to chroot to directory after processing the
command-line arguments, but before reading the configuration
file.

WARNING:

This option should be used in
conjunction with the -u option, as chrooting a
process running as root doesn't enhance security on most
systems; the way chroot is defined allows a process
with root privileges to escape a chroot jail.

-U #listeners

This option has been removed.
Attempts to use it now result in a warning.

-u user

This option sets the setuid to
user after completing privileged operations, such as
creating sockets that listen on privileged ports.

NOTE:

On Linux, named uses the
kernel's capability mechanism to drop all root privileges
except the ability to bind to a privileged port and
set process resource limits. Unfortunately, this means that
the -u option only works when named is run on
kernel 2.2.18 or later, or kernel 2.3.99-pre3 or later,
since previous kernels did not allow privileges to be
retained after setuid.

-v

This option reports the version number and exits.

-V

This option reports the version number, build options,
supported cryptographics algorithms, and exits.

-X lock-file

This option has been removed
and using it will cause a fatal error.

SIGNALS

In routine
operation, signals should not be used to control the
nameserver; rndc should be used instead.

SIGHUP

This signal forces a reload of the server.

SIGINT, SIGTERM

These signals shut down the
server.

The result of
sending any other signals to the server is undefined.

CONFIGURATION

The
named configuration file is too complex to describe
in detail here. A complete description is provided in the
BIND 9 Administrator Reference Manual.

named
inherits the umask (file creation mode mask) from the
parent process. If files created by named, such as
journal files, need to have custom permissions, the
umask should be set explicitly in the script used to
start the named process.

FILES

/etc/bind/named.conf

The default configuration
file.

/run/named.pid

The default process-id
file.
