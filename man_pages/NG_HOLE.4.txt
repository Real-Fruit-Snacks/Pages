SYNOPSIS

#include 

#include 

DESCRIPTION

The hole node type
silently discards all data and control messages it receives.
This type is used for testing and debugging.

HOOKS

A ng_hole node accepts
any request to connect, regardless of the hook name, as long
as the name is unique.

CONTROL MESSAGES

This node type supports the
generic control messages, plus the following:

NGM_HOLE_GET_STATS
(getstats)

This command takes an ASCII
string argument, the hook name, and returns the statistics
associated with the hook as a struct
ng_hole_hookstat.

NGM_HOLE_CLR_STATS
(clrstats)

This command takes an ASCII
string argument, the hook name, and clears the statistics
associated with the hook.

NGM_HOLE_GETCLR_STATS
(getclrstats)

This command is identical to
NGM_HOLE_GET_STATS, except that the statistics are also
atomically cleared.

SHUTDOWN

This node shuts down upon
receipt of a NGM_SHUTDOWN control message, or when all hooks
have been disconnected.

SEE ALSO

ngctl(8)

HISTORY

The ng_hole node type was
implemented in FreeBSD 4.0.
