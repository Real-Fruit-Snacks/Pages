NAME

sd_machine_get_class,
sd_machine_get_ifindices - Determine the class and network
interface indices of a locally running virtual machine or
container

SYNOPSIS

#include

int
sd_machine_get_class(const char* machine,
char **class); 

int
sd_machine_get_ifindices(const char* machine,
int **ret_ifindices); 

DESCRIPTION

sd_machine_get_class()
may be used to determine the class of a locally running
virtual machine or container that is registered with
systemd-machined.service(8). The string returned is
either "vm" or "container". The returned
string needs to be freed with the libc free(3) call
after use.

sd_machine_get_ifindices()
may be used to determine the numeric indices of the network
interfaces on the host that are pointing towards the
specified locally running virtual machine or container. The
vm or container must be registered with
systemd-machined.service(8). The output parameter
ret_ifindices may be passed as NULL when the
output value is not needed. The returned array needs to be
freed with the libc free(3) call after use.

RETURN VALUE

On success,
these functions return a non-negative integer.
sd_machine_get_ifindices() returns the number of the
relevant network interfaces. On failure, these calls return
a negative errno-style error code.

Errors

Returned errors may indicate the following problems:

-ENXIO

The specified machine does not
exist or is currently not running.

-EINVAL

An input parameter was invalid
(out of range, or NULL, where that is not
accepted).

-ENOMEM

Memory allocation failed.

NOTES

Functions
described here are available as a shared library, which can
be compiled against and linked to with the
libsystemd pkg-config(1) file.

The code
described here uses getenv(3), which is declared to
be not multi-thread-safe. This means that the code calling
the functions described here must not call setenv(3)
from a parallel thread. It is recommended to only do calls
to setenv() from an early phase of the program when
no other threads have been started.

HISTORY

sd_machine_get_class()
and sd_machine_get_ifindices() were added in version
217.
