NAME

burst - explode
digests into nmh messages

SYNOPSIS

burst

[-help] [-version]
[+folder] [msgs] [-inplace |
-noinplace] [-mime | -nomime]
[-automime] [-quiet | -noquiet]
[-verbose | -noverbose]

DESCRIPTION

burst
considers the specified messages in the named folder to be
Internet digests, and explodes them in that folder.

If
-inplace is given, each digest is replaced by its
“table of contents” and the digest is removed.
burst then renumbers the messages which follow the
digest, in the folder, making room for each of the exploded
messages, which are placed immediately after the
“table of contents”.

If
-noinplace is given, each digest is preserved, no
table of contents is produced, and the exploded messages are
placed at the end of the folder. Other messages in the
folder are not affected.

If
-automime is given, burst will try to
determine if the message is formatted with MIME and contains
MIME parts of type “message/rfc822”. If it does,
it will burst the message using MIME formatting rules. The
-mime switch can be used to enforce the use of MIME
formatting. The -nomime switch will force
burst to use RFC 934 rules.

The
-quiet switch directs burst to be silent about
reporting messages that are not in digest format.

The
-verbose switch directs burst to tell the user
the general actions that it is taking to explode the
digest.

It turns out
that burst works equally well on forwarded messages
and blind-carbon-copies as on Internet digests, provided
that the former were generated by forw or
send.

CONTEXT

If a folder is given, it will
become the current folder. If -inplace is given, then
the first message burst becomes the current message. This
leaves the context ready for a show of the table of
contents of the digest, and a next to see the first
message of the digest. If -noinplace is given, then
the first message extracted from the first digest burst
becomes the current message. This leaves the context in a
similar, but not identical, state to the context achieved
when using -inplace.

BUGS

The
burst program enforces a limit of approximately 1,000
on the number of messages which may be burst from a
single message. There is usually no limit on the number of
messages which may reside in the folder after the
bursting.

Although
burst uses a sophisticated algorithm to determine
where one encapsulated message ends and another begins, not
all digest creators use an encapsulation algorithm. In
degenerate cases, this usually results in burst
finding an encapsulation boundary prematurely and splitting
a single encapsulated message into two or more messages.
These erroneous digest creators should be fixed.

Furthermore,
any text which appears after the last encapsulated message
is not placed in a separate message by burst. This
text is usually an “End of digest” string. As a
result of this possibly unfriendly behavior on the part of
burst, note that when the -inplace option is
used, this trailing information is lost. In practice, this
is not a problem since correspondents usually place remarks
in text prior to the first encapsulated message, and this
information is not lost.
