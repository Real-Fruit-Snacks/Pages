of components that integrates browsing, email, web-based
word processing, chat, and group scheduling to allow users
to easily communicate, share, and access information.

management. On SGI systems, IRIX session

-session-management.

-noraise

Does not display the remote
window on top when using -remote commands. See
-raise and -remote.

-raise

Displays the remote window on
top when using -remote commands. See -noraise
and -remote.

-remote
remote-command

Connects to and controls an
existing process. You can issue multiple -remote
options on the same command line. The commands are executed
sequentially unless a command fails. If there is no Netscape
process currently running, this command fails. If the
command fails, an error message will be reported to stderr
and it will exit with a nonzero status. See REMOTE
ACTIONS section below and EXAMPLES.

The following
options exist for finer-grained control of the
-remote commands: 
-id X_window_ID

If there is more than one
Netscape Navigator window open, this option selects the
window to control. If you do not use this option, the first
window found is controlled. See EXAMPLES.

-raise 
-noraise

Controls whether the
-remote command causes the Netscape window to
raise/not raise itself to the top. The default is raise.

You can use
-raise and -noraise options with the
addBookmark and openURL arguments. See
EXAMPLES.

-session-management

Enables session management.
Session management is enabled by default. See
-no-session-management.

-version

Displays the version number and
build date.

-visual
id-or-number

Uses the specified server
visual.

-xrm
resource-spec

Sets the specified X
resource.

REMOTE ACTIONS

When Netscape
Navigator is invoked with the -remote argument, it
does not open a window, but instead connects to and controls
an already existing process. The argument to the
-remote switch is an Xt action to invoke, with
optional arguments. Remote control is implemented using X
properties, so the two processes need not be running on the
same machine, and need not share a file system. See
http://home.netscape.com/newsref/std/x-remote.html.

All of
Netscape&rsquo;s action names are the same as its
resource names. For example, if you wanted to know the name
of the action that corresponds to the &rsquo;&rsquo;Add
Bookmark&rsquo;&rsquo; menu item, you could look in
Netscape for &rsquo;&rsquo;Add
Bookmark&rsquo;&rsquo; and see that the resource that is
set to that string is addBookmark. That is the name
of the Action as well. Note: To find the
Netscape file, use the full path name which is, by
default,
/usr/dt/appconfig/netscape/lib/locale/C/app-defaults/Netscape.

You can use
Actions in Translation tables in the usual Xt manner, but
you can also invoke them directly via the -remote
option, like this:

netscape
-remote &rsquo;addBookmark()&rsquo;

That command
will cause the existing Netscape Navigator process to add
its current URL to the bookmarks, just as if you had
selected that menu item.

To open a
document, enter:

netscape
-remote
&rsquo;openURL(http://home.netscape.com)&rsquo;

Invoking an
action with no arguments has the same effect as selecting
the corresponding menu item. However, with some actions you
can pass the following arguments: 
addBookmark( )

Adds the current document to
the Bookmark list.

addBookmark(URL)

Adds the specified document to
the Bookmark list. See EXAMPLES.

addBookmark(URL,
title)

Adds the specified document and
title to the Bookmark list.

mailto( )

Opens the mail dialog box with
an empty To: field.

mailto(a, b.
c)

Inserts the specified
address(es) in the default To: field.

openFile( )

Opens a dialog box that prompts
for a file.

openFile(filename)

Opens the specified file.

openURL( )

Opens a dialog box that prompts
for a URL.

openURL(URL)

Opens the specified document.
See EXAMPLES.

openURL(URL, new
window)

Opens a new window displaying
the specified document.

saveAs( )

Opens a dialog box that prompts
for a URL.

saveAs(output_file)

Writes HTML to the
specified file.

saveAs(output_file,
type)

Writes the type to the
specified file (HTML, text, or PostScript).

EXIT STATUS

If a command
fails, an error message is reported to stderr and the
command exits with a nonzero status.
