NAME

pmFreeResult,
pmFreeHighResResult, - release storage allocated for
performance metrics values

C SYNOPSIS

#include

void
pmFreeResult(pmResult *result); 
void pmFreeHighResResult(pmHighResResult
*result);

DESCRIPTION

The variable
sized results returned by pmFetch(3) and
pmFetchHighRes(3) are allocated below the Performance
Metrics Application Programming Interface (PMAPI) using a
combination of dynamic (i.e. malloc(3)) and
specialized allocation strategies.

Applications
should call pmFreeResult to release the storage
previously allocated for result by pmFetch(3),
when the application no longer requires access to the
pmResult structure.

Under no
circumstances should an application use free(result)
to release storage previously allocated for a
pmResult by pmFetch(3).

Similarly,
memory allocated for the high resolution timestamped
result structure returned from
pmFetchHighRes(3) should be released by a call to
pmFreeHighResResult.
