NAME
       Lintian::Index - access to collected data about the upstream (orig)
       sources

SYNOPSIS
           use Lintian::Index;

DESCRIPTION
       Lintian::Processable::Source::Orig::Index provides an interface to
       collected data about the upstream (orig) sources.

INSTANCE METHODS
       identifier
       catalog
           Returns a reference to a hash with elements catalogued by path
           names.

       "basedir"
           Returns the base directory for file references.

       "anchored"
       unpack_messages
       lookup (FILE)
           Like "index" except orig_index is based on the "orig tarballs" of
           the source packages.

           For native packages "index" and "orig_index" are generally
           identical.

           NB: If sorted_index includes a debian packaging, it is was
           contained in upstream part of the source package (or the package is
           native).
