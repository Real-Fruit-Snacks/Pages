NAME

sd_bus_message_get_cookie,
sd_bus_message_get_reply_cookie - Returns the transaction
cookie of a message

SYNOPSIS

#include

int
sd_bus_message_get_cookie(sd_bus_message *message,
uint64_t *cookie); 

int
sd_bus_message_get_reply_cookie(sd_bus_message *message,
uint64_t *cookie); 

DESCRIPTION

sd_bus_message_get_cookie()
returns the transaction cookie of a message. The cookie
uniquely identifies a message within each bus peer, but is
not globally unique. It is assigned when a message is
sent.

sd_bus_message_get_reply_cookie()
returns the transaction cookie of the message the specified
message is a response to. When a reply message is generated
for a method call message, its cookie is copied over into
this field. Note that while every message that is
transferred is identified by a cookie, only response
messages carry a reply cookie field.

Both functions
take a message object as first parameter and a place to
store the 64-bit cookie in.

RETURN VALUE

On success,
these calls return 0 or a positive integer. On failure, they
return a negative errno-style error code.

On success, the
cookie/reply cookie is returned in the specified 64-bit
unsigned integer variable.

Errors

Returned errors may indicate the following problems:

-EINVAL

A specified parameter is
invalid.

-ENODATA

No cookie has been assigned to
this message. This either indicates that the message has not
been sent yet and hence has no cookie assigned, or that the
message is not a method response message and hence carries a
reply cookie field.

NOTES

Functions
described here are available as a shared library, which can
be compiled against and linked to with the
libsystemd pkg-config(1) file.

The code
described here uses getenv(3), which is declared to
be not multi-thread-safe. This means that the code calling
the functions described here must not call setenv(3)
from a parallel thread. It is recommended to only do calls
to setenv() from an early phase of the program when
no other threads have been started.

HISTORY

sd_bus_message_get_cookie()
and sd_bus_message_get_reply_cookie() were added in
version 209.
