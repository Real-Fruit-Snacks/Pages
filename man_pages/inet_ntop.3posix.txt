       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may

NAME
       inet_ntop, inet_pton — convert IPv4 and IPv6 addresses  between  binary
       and text form

SYNOPSIS
       #include <arpa/inet.h>

       const char *inet_ntop(int af, const void *restrict src,
           char *restrict dst, socklen_t size);
       int inet_pton(int af, const char *restrict src, void *restrict dst);

DESCRIPTION
       The  inet_ntop()  function  shall convert a numeric address into a text
       string suitable for presentation. The af  argument  shall  specify  the
       family  of the address. This can be AF_INET or AF_INET6.  The src argu‐
       ment points to a buffer holding an IPv4 address if the af  argument  is
       AF_INET, or an IPv6 address if the af argument is AF_INET6; the address
       must be in network byte order. The dst  argument  points  to  a  buffer
       where  the  function  stores the resulting text string; it shall not be
       NULL. The size argument specifies the size of this buffer, which  shall
       be large enough to hold the text string (INET_ADDRSTRLEN characters for
       IPv4, INET6_ADDRSTRLEN characters for IPv6).

       The inet_pton() function shall convert an address in its standard  text
       presentation  form  into its numeric binary form. The af argument shall
       specify the family of the address. The  AF_INET  and  AF_INET6  address
       families  shall be supported. The src argument points to the string be‐
       ing passed in. The dst argument points to a buffer into which the func‐
       tion stores the numeric address; this shall be large enough to hold the
       numeric address (32 bits for AF_INET, 128 bits for AF_INET6).

       If the af argument of inet_pton() is AF_INET, the src string  shall  be
       in the standard IPv4 dotted-decimal form:

           ddd.ddd.ddd.ddd

       where  "ddd"  is  a one to three digit decimal number between 0 and 255
       (see inet_addr()).  The inet_pton() function does not accept other for‐
       mats  (such  as  the octal numbers, hexadecimal numbers, and fewer than
       four numbers that inet_addr() accepts).

       If the af argument of inet_pton() is AF_INET6, the src string shall  be
       in one of the following standard IPv6 text forms:

        1. The  preferred  form  is  "x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x", where the 'x's are the
           hexadecimal values of the  eight  16-bit  pieces  of  the  address.
           Leading  zeros in individual fields can be omitted, but there shall
           be one to four hexadecimal digits in every field.

        2. A string of contiguous zero fields in the  preferred  form  can  be
           shown  as  "::".   The "::" can only appear once in an address. Un‐
           specified addresses ("0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0") may be  represented  simply
           as "::".

        3. A  third form that is sometimes more convenient when dealing with a
           mixed environment of IPv4 and IPv6 nodes is  "x:x:x:x:x:x:d.d.d.d",
           where  the  'x's  are  the hexadecimal values of the six high-order
           16-bit pieces of the address, and the 'd's are the  decimal  values
           of  the  four  low-order 8-bit pieces of the address (standard IPv4
           representation).

       Note:     A more extensive description of the standard  representations
                 of IPv6 addresses can be found in RFC 2373.

RETURN VALUE
       The  inet_ntop() function shall return a pointer to the buffer contain‐
       ing the text string if the conversion succeeds, and NULL otherwise, and
       set errno to indicate the error.

       The  inet_pton()  function  shall  return 1 if the conversion succeeds,
       with the address pointed to by dst in network byte order. It shall  re‐
       turn  0  if  the  input  is not a valid IPv4 dotted-decimal string or a
       valid IPv6 address string, or -1 with errno set  to  [EAFNOSUPPORT]  if
       the af argument is unknown.

ERRORS
       The inet_ntop() and inet_pton() functions shall fail if:

       EAFNOSUPPORT
              The af argument is invalid.

       ENOSPC The size of the inet_ntop() result buffer is inadequate.
