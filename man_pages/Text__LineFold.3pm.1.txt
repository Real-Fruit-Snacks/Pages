NAME
       Text::LineFold - Line Folding for Plain Text

SYNOPSIS
           use Text::LineFold;
           $lf = Text::LineFold->new();

           # Fold lines
           $folded = $lf->fold($string, 'PLAIN');
           $indented = $lf->fold(' ' x 8, ' ' x 4, $string);

           # Unfold lines
           $unfolded = $lf->unfold($string, 'FIXED');

DESCRIPTION
       Text::LineFold folds or unfolds lines of plain text.  As it mainly
       focuses on plain text e-mail messages, RFC 3676 flowed format is also
       supported.

   Public Interface
       new ([KEY => VALUE, ...])
           Constructor.  About KEY => VALUE pairs see config method.

       $self->config (KEY)
       $self->config ([KEY => VAL, ...])
           Instance method.  Get or update configuration.  Following KEY =>
           VALUE pairs may be specified.

           Charset => CHARSET
               Character set that is used to encode string.  It may be string
               or MIME::Charset object.  Default is "UTF-8".

           Language => LANGUAGE
               Along with Charset option, this may be used to define
               language/region context.  Default is "XX".  See also "Context"
               in Unicode::LineBreak option.

           Newline => STRING
               String to be used for newline sequence.  Default is "\n".

           OutputCharset => CHARSET
               Character set that is used to encode result of fold()/unfold().
               It may be string or MIME::Charset object.  If a special value
               "_UNICODE_" is specified, result will be Unicode string.
               Default is the value of Charset option.

           TabSize => NUMBER
               Column width of tab stops.  When 0 is specified, tab stops are
               ignored.  Default is 8.

           BreakIndent
           CharMax
           ColMax
           ColMin
           ComplexBreaking
           EAWidth
           HangulAsAL
           LBClass
           LegacyCM
           Prep
           Urgent
               See "Options" in Unicode::LineBreak.

       $self->fold (STRING, [METHOD])
       $self->fold (INITIAL_TAB, SUBSEQUENT_TAB, STRING, ...)
           Instance method.  fold() folds lines of string STRING and returns
           it.  Surplus SPACEs and horizontal tabs at end of line are removed,
           newline sequences are replaced by that specified by Newline option
           and newline is appended at end of text if it does not exist.
           Horizontal tabs are treated as tab stops according to TabSize
           option.

           By the first style, following options may be specified for METHOD
           argument.

           "FIXED"
               Lines preceded by ">" won't be folded.  Paragraphs are
               separated by empty line.

           "FLOWED"
               "Format=Flowed; DelSp=Yes" formatting defined by RFC 3676.

           "PLAIN"
               Default method.  All lines are folded.

           Second style is similar to "wrap()" in Text::Wrap.  All lines are
           folded.  INITIAL_TAB is inserted at beginning of paragraphs and
           SUBSEQUENT_TAB at beginning of other broken lines.

       $self->unfold (STRING, METHOD)
           Conjunct folded paragraphs of string STRING and returns it.

           Following options may be specified for METHOD argument.

           "FIXED"
               Default method.  Lines preceded by ">" won't be conjuncted.
               Treat empty line as paragraph separator.

           "FLOWED"
               Unfold "Format=Flowed; DelSp=Yes" formatting defined by RFC
               3676.

           "FLOWEDSP"
               Unfold "Format=Flowed; DelSp=No" formatting defined by RFC
               3676.
