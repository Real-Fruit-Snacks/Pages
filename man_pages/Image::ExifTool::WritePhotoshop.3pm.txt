NAME
       Image::ExifTool::WritePhotoshop.pl - Write Photoshop IRB meta
       information

SYNOPSIS
       This file is autoloaded by Image::ExifTool::Photoshop.

DESCRIPTION
       This file contains routines to write Photoshop metadata.

NOTES
       Photoshop IRB blocks may have an associated resource name.  By default,
       the existing name is preserved when rewriting a resource, and an empty
       name is used when creating a new resource.  However, a different
       resource name may be specified by defining a "SetResourceName" entry in
       the tag information hash.  With this defined, a new resource name may
       be appended to the value in the form "VALUE/#NAME#/" (the slashes and
       hashes are literal).  If "SetResourceName" is anything other than '1',
       the value is used as a default resource name, and applied if no
       appended name is provided.
