ISPFW(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual ISPFW(4)

NAME

ispfw â€” Firmware
for Qlogic based SPI and FibreChannel SCSI Host Adapters

SYNOPSIS

To compile this driver into the
kernel, place the following line in your kernel
configuration file:

device
ispfw

Alternatively,
to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following line in loader.conf(5):

ispfw_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION

This trivial driver provides
access to firmware sets for the Qlogic based SPI and
FibreChannel SCSI Host Adapters. It may either be statically
linked into the kernel, or loaded as a module. In either
case, the isp(4) driver will notice that firmware is
available to be downloaded onto Qlogic cards (to replace the
usually out of date firmware on the cards). This will kick
the f/w into getting unstuck.
