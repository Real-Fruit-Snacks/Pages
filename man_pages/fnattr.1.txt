object

SYNOPSIS

fnattr
[-AL] composite_name [ [-O | -U]
identifier...]

fnattr
[-L] composite_name [ -a [-s]

[-O | -U] identifier [value...]
| -d [ [-O | -U] identifier
[value...]] | -m 
[-O | -U] identifier old_value
new_value] ...

DESCRIPTION

The
fnattr command is for updating and examining
attributes associated with an FNS named object. There
are four uses for this command: add an attribute or value,
delete an attribute or value, modify an attribute&rsquo;s
value, and list the contents of an attribute.

OPTIONS

The options for
adding, modifying, and deleting attributes and their values
can be combined in the same command line. The modifications
will be executed in the order that they are specified.

Any
unsuccessful modification will abort all subsequent
modifications specified in the command line; any
modifications already carried out will remain. The
unsuccessful modifications are displayed as output of
fnattr.

-a

Add an attribute or add a value to an attribute
associated with object named by composite_name.
identifier is the identifier of the attribute to
manipulate; its format is FN_ID_STRING unless the
-O or -U option is given. value ...
represents the attribute values to add. The attribute syntax
used for storing value is
fn_attr_syntax_ascii. 

-A

Consult the authoritative source to get attribute
information. 

-d

Delete attributes associated with object named by
composite_name. If identifier is not
specified, all attributes associated with the named object
are deleted. If identifier is specified without
accompanying values (value ...), the entire attribute
identified by identifier is removed. If individual
attribute values (value ...) are specified, then only
these are removed from the attribute. Removal of the last
value of an attribute entails removal of the attribute as
well. The format of identifier is FN_ID_STRING
unless the -O or -U option is given.

-L

If the composite name is bound to an XFN link,
manipulate the attributes associated with the object pointed
to by the link. If -L is not used, the attributes
associated with the XFN link are manipulated.

-m

Modify the values of the attribute identified by
identifier associated with the object named by
composite_name. old_value is replaced by
new_value in the specified attribute. Other
attributes and values associated with composite_name
are not affected. The format of identifier is
FN_ID_STRING unless the -O or -U option
is given.

-O

The format of identifier is
FN_ID_ISO_OID_STRING, an ASN.1 dot-separated
integer list string.

-s

Add in supersede mode. If an attribute with the same
identifier as identifier already exists, remove
all its values, and replace with value. If
this option is omitted, the resulting values for the
specified attribute is a union of the existing values and
value. 

-U

The format of identifier is
FN_ID_DCE_UUID, a DCE UUID in string form.

OPERANDS

The following
operand is supported: 
composite_name

An FNS named object.

EXAMPLES

Adding

The -a option is used for adding attributes and
values. This following command replaces the value of the
shoesize attribute of user/jane with the value
7.5:

eg% fnattr
user/jane -as shoesize 7.5

The following
command adds the value Chameleo to the project
attribute of user/jane:

eg% fnattr
user/jsmith -a project Chameleo

Deleting

The -d option is used for deleting attributes and
values. The following command deletes all the attributes
associated with user/jane:

eg% fnattr
user/jane -d

The following
command deletes the attribute shoesize associated
with user/jane:

eg% fnattr
user/jane -d shoesize

The following
command deletes the attribute value old_project from
the projects attribute associated with
user/jane:

eg% fnattr
user/jane -d projects old_project

Modifying

The -m option is for modifying an attribute value.
The following command replaces the value Chameleo by
Dungeon in the projects attribute associated
with user/jsmith:

eg% fnattr
user/jsmith -m projects Chameleo Dungeon

The following
command is an example of unsuccessful modification attempts.
The user executing this command does not have permission to
update user/jane&rsquo;s attributes but is allowed to
add new attributes. Executing the command will add
the attribute hatsize but will not delete shoesize or
modify dresssize because -d shoesize will fail
and cause the command to stop:

eg% fnattr
user/jane -a hatsize medium -d shoesize -m
dresssize 5 6

Listing

No options are required to list attributes and their values.
The following command lists all the attributes associated
with user/jane:

eg% fnattr
user/jane

The following
command lists the values of the project attribute of
user/jane:

eg% fnattr
user/jane project

The following
command lists the values of the project and
shoesize attributes of user/jane:

eg% fnattr
user/jane project shoesize

NOTES

Built-in
attributes, such as onc_unix_passwd for users, cannot
be updated using the fnattr command. Their contents
are affected by updates to the underlying naming service,
such as NIS+ or NIS.
