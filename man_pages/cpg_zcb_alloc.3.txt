NAME

cpg_zcb_alloc -
Allocates a zero copy buffer

SYNOPSIS

#include

int
cpg_zcb_alloc(cpg_handle_t handle, size_t
size, void **buffer);

DESCRIPTION

The
cpg_zcb_alloc function will allocate a zero copy
buffer for use with the cpg_zcb_mcast_joined(3)
function. This buffer should not be used in another thread
while a cpg_zcb_mcast_joined operation is taking place on
the buffer. The buffer is allocated via operating system
mechanisms to avoid copying in the IPC layer.

The argument
handle describes the handle on which the buffer will
be allocated.

The argument
size requests a buffer of size be allocated.

The
buffer argument is set to the buffer address that is
allocated by this operation.

RETURN VALUE

This call
returns the CS_OK value if successful, otherwise an error is
returned.

ERRORS

The errors are
undocumented.
