NAME

i2cdetect -
detect I2C chips

SYNOPSIS

i2cdetect
[-y] [-a] [-q|-r] i2cbus
[first last] 
i2cdetect -F i2cbus 
i2cdetect -V 
i2cdetect -l

DESCRIPTION

i2cdetect is a
userspace program to scan an I2C bus for devices. It outputs
a table with the list of detected devices on the specified
bus. i2cbus indicates the number or name of the I2C
bus to be scanned, and should correspond to one of the
busses listed by i2cdetect -l. The optional
parameters first and last restrict the
scanning range (default: from 0x08 to 0x77).

As there is no
standard I2C detection command, i2cdetect uses arbitrary
SMBus commands (namely SMBus quick write and SMBus receive
byte) to probe for devices. By default, the command used is
the one believed to be the safest for each address. See
options -q and -r to change this behavior.

i2cdetect can
also be used to query the functionalities of an I2C bus (see
option -F.)

WARNING

This program
can confuse your I2C bus, cause data loss and worse!

INTERPRETING THE OUTPUT

Each cell in
the output table will contain one of the following
symbols:

•

"--". The address was probed but no chip
answered. 

•

"UU". Probing was skipped, because this
address is currently in use by a driver. This strongly
suggests that there is a chip at this address.

•

An address number in hexadecimal, e.g. "2d" or
"4e". A chip was found at this address.

OPTIONS

-y

Disable interactive mode. By
default, i2cdetect will wait for a confirmation from the
user before messing with the I2C bus. When this flag is
used, it will perform the operation directly. This is mainly
meant to be used in scripts.

-a

Force scanning of non-regular addresses. Not
recommended. 

-q

Use SMBus "quick write" command for probing.
Not recommended. This is known to corrupt the Atmel AT24RF08
EEPROM found on many IBM Thinkpad laptops.

-r

Use SMBus "receive byte" command for probing.
Not recommended. This is known to lock SMBus on various
write-only chips (most notably clock chips at address
0x69). 

-F

Display the list of functionalities implemented by the
adapter and exit.

-V

Display the version and exit.

-l

Output a list of installed busses.

EXAMPLES

List all
available I2C busses:

# i2cdetect -l

Immediately
scan the standard addresses on I2C bus 9 (i2c-9), using the
default method for each address (no user confirmation):

# i2cdetect -y 9

Query the
functionalities of I2C bus 1 (i2c-1):

# i2cdetect -F 1

Scan addresses
0x10 to 0x17 on the I2C bus named "SMBus I801 adapter
at efa0", using the "receive byte" method,
after user confirmation:

# i2cdetect -r "SMBus I801
adapter at efa0" 0x10 0x17
