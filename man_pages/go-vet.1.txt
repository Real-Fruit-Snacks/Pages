NAME

go-vet - report
likely mistakes in packages

SYNOPSIS

go vet
[-n] [-x] [-vettool prog]
[build flags] [vet flags]
[packages]

DESCRIPTION

Vet runs the Go
vet command on the packages named by the import paths.

For more about
vet and its flags, see ’go doc cmd/vet’. 
For more about specifying packages, see
go-packages(7). 
For a list of checkers and their flags, see ’go tool
vet help’. 
For details of a specific checker such as
’printf’, see ’go tool vet help
printf’.

OPTIONS

-n

The -n flag prints commands that
would be executed.

-x

The -x flag prints commands as they are executed.

-vettool=prog

The -vettool=prog flag selects
a different analysis tool with alternative or additional
checks. 
For example, the ’shadow’ analyzer can be built
and run using these commands:

go install
golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/passes/shadow/cmd/shadow 
go vet -vettool=$(which shadow)

The build flags
supported by go vet are those that control package
resolution and execution, such as -n, -x, -v, -tags, and
-toolexec. For more about these flags, see ’go help
build’.
