debconf&minus;updatepo
&minus; update PO files about debconf templates

SYNOPSIS

debconf-updatepo
[&minus;v] [&minus;h]
[&minus;&minus;podir=
DIR ]
[&minus;&minus;skip&minus;pot]
[&minus;&minus;skip&minus;merge]
[&minus;&minus;msgid&minus;bugs&minus;address=
EMAIL ]

DESCRIPTION

This program
reads po/POTFILES.in to determine which master files
need to be processed, then extracts new gettext strings into
po/templates.pot and updates all po/*.po
files. This script can be called either in the top-level
directory, or in the debian or debian/po
subdirectories. It is run by developer and/or translator to
update PO files when the English text is
modified in templates files.

OPTIONS

&minus;h,
&minus;&minus;help

Display a usage summary and
exit.

&minus;v,
&minus;&minus;verbose

Process in verbose mode.

&minus;&minus;podir=
DIR

Set directory for
PO files. By default PO files
are searched in debian/po, po and ../po
directories in that order.

&minus;&minus;skip&minus;pot

Do not generate a new
po/templates.pot file.

&minus;&minus;skip&minus;merge

Do not merge existing
PO files with po/templates.pot.

&minus;&minus;msgid&minus;bugs&minus;address=
EMAIL

Set the email address that will
be specified in the POT &rsquo;s
Report-Msgid-Bugs-To field.

By default,
this field is set to @package.debian.org.

It is intended
for the maintainers of Debian based distributions, and
should be used in the following cases:

o

The package is not present in Debian (and thus the
@packages.debian.org address does not
exist). 

o

The maintainer made significant changes in the debconf
templates (or added templates to a Debian package without
templates), and does not want to bother the Debian
maintainer with bug reports that won&rsquo;t be relevant for
the Debian maintainer.

The default
address is preferred to avoid corrections in the Debian
based distribution without a notification to the Debian
maintainer.
