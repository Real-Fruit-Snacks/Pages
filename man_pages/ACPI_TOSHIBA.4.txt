ACPI_TOSHIBA(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual
ACPI_TOSHIBA(4)

NAME

acpi_toshiba —
Toshiba HCI interface

SYNOPSIS

To compile this driver into the
kernel, place the following line in your kernel
configuration file:

device
acpi_toshiba

Alternatively,
to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following line in loader.conf(5):

acpi_toshiba_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION

HCI is Toshiba’s
Hardware Control Interface which is somewhat uniform
across their models. The acpi_toshiba driver allows
the user to manipulate HCI-controlled hardware using a
number of sysctl(8) variables.

SYSCTL VARIABLES

The following sysctls are
currently implemented:

hw.acpi.toshiba.force_fan

Causes active cooling to be
forcibly enabled (’1’) or disabled
(’0’) regardless of the current temperature.

hw.acpi.toshiba.video_output

Sets the active display to use
according to a bitwise OR of the following:

0

No display

1

LCD

2

CRT

4

TV-Out

Only some
systems (i.e., the Libretto L5) support video switching via
this hardware-specific driver. Use the acpi_video(4) driver
for generic video output support.

hw.acpi.toshiba.lcd_brightness

Makes the LCD backlight
brighter or dimmer (higher values are brighter).

hw.acpi.toshiba.lcd_backlight

Turns the LCD backlight on and
off.

hw.acpi.toshiba.cpu_speed

Sets the CPU speed to the
specified speed. This provides functionality similar to the
hw.acpi.cpu.throttle_state variable. Higher sysctl
values mean lower CPU speeds.

Defaults for
these variables can be set in sysctl.conf(5), which is
parsed at boot-time.

LOADER TUNABLES

The
hw.acpi.toshiba.enable_fn_keys tunable enables or
disables the function keys on the keyboard. Function keys
are enabled by default.

This behaviour
can be changed at the loader(8) prompt or in
loader.conf(5).
