NAME

runc-run
- create and start a container

SYNOPSIS

runc run
[option ...] container-id

DESCRIPTION

The run
command creates an instance of a container from a bundle,
and starts it. You can think of run as a shortcut for
create followed by start.

OPTIONS

--bundle|-b
path

Path to the root of the bundle
directory. Default is current directory.

--console-socket
path

Path to an AF_UNIX
socket which will receive a file descriptor referencing the
master end of the console&rsquo;s pseudoterminal. See
docs/terminals &lang;
https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/blob/master/docs/terminals.md&rang;
.

--detach|-d

Detach from the
container&rsquo;s process.

--pid-file
path

Specify the file to write the
initial container process&rsquo; PID to.

--no-subreaper

Disable the use of the
subreaper used to reap reparented processes.

--no-pivot

Do not use pivot root to jail
process inside rootfs. This should not be used except in
exceptional circumstances, and may be unsafe from the
security standpoint.

--no-new-keyring

Do not create a new session
keyring for the container. This will cause the container to
inherit the calling processes session key.

--preserve-fds
N

Pass N additional file
descriptors to the container (stdio +
$LISTEN_FDS + N in total). Default is
0.

--keep

Keep container&rsquo;s state directory and cgroup. This
can be helpful if a user wants to check the state (e.g. of
cgroup controllers) after the container has exited. If this
option is used, a manual runc delete is needed
afterwards to clean an exited container&rsquo;s
artefacts.
