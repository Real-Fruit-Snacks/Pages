NAME
       Font::TTF::Vmtx - Vertical Metrics

DESCRIPTION
       Contains the advance height and top side bearing for each glyph. Given
       the compressability of the data onto disk, this table uses information
       from other tables, and thus must do part of its output during the
       output of other tables

INSTANCE VARIABLES
       The vertical metrics are kept in two arrays by glyph id. The variable
       names do not start with a space

       advance
           An array containing the advance height for each glyph

       top An array containing the top side bearing for each glyph

METHODS
   $t->read
       Reads the vertical metrics from the TTF file into memory

   $t->out($fh)
       Writes the metrics to a TTF file. Assumes that the "vhea" has updated
       the numVMetrics from here

BUGS
       None known
