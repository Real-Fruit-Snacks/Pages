NAME
       pee - tee standard input to pipes

SYNOPSIS
       pee [--[no-]ignore-sigpipe] [--[no-]ignore-write-errors]
           [["command"...]]

DESCRIPTION
       pee is like tee but for pipes. Each command is run and fed a copy of
       the standard input. The output of all commands is sent to stdout.

       Note that while this is similar to tee, a copy of the input is not sent
       to stdout, like tee does. If that is desired, use pee cat ...

OPTIONS
       --ignore-sigpipe, --no-ignore-sigpipe
           Do (not) ignore SIGPIPE. Any command started by pee might cause a
           SIGPIPE when it exists. If you ignore SIGPIPE, you probably also
           want to ignore write errors (see below). Ignoring SIGPIPE is the
           default behaviour.

       --ignore-write-errors, --no-ignore-write-errors
           Do (not) ignore write errors. When a command started by pee is no
           more accepting data via the pipe between itself and pee, a write
           error occurs in pee. If this error is not ignored, pee is going to
           terminate all child processes and exists. Ignoring write errors is
           the default behaviour.
