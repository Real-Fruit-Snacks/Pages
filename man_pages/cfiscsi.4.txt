CFISCSI(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual CFISCSI(4)

NAME

cfiscsi &mdash; CAM
Target Layer iSCSI target frontend

SYNOPSIS

To compile this driver into the
kernel, place the following lines in your kernel
configuration file:

device
cfiscsi 
device ctl 
device iscsi

Alternatively,
to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following line in loader.conf(5):

cfiscsi_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION

The cfiscsi subsystem
provides the kernel component of an iSCSI target. The target
is the iSCSI server, providing LUNs backed by local files
and volumes to remote initiators. The userspace component is
provided by ctld(8). cfiscsi is implemented as a
ctl(4) frontend and uses infrastructure provided by
iscsi(4).

SYSCTL VARIABLES

The following variables are
available as both sysctl(8) variables and loader(8)
tunables:

kern.cam.ctl.iscsi.debug

Verbosity level for log
messages from the kernel part of iSCSI target. Set to 0 to
disable logging or 1 to warn about potential problems.
Larger values enable debugging output. Defaults to 1.

kern.cam.ctl.iscsi.maxtags

The number of outstanding
commands to advertise to each iSCSI initiator. Current
implementation is not very accurate, so do not set this
below 2. Defaults to 256.

kern.cam.ctl.iscsi.ping_timeout

The number of seconds to wait
for the iSCSI initiator to respond to a NOP-In PDU. In the
event that there is no response within that time the session
gets forcibly terminated. Set to 0 to disable sending NOP-In
PDUs. Defaults to 5.

HISTORY

The cfiscsi subsystem
first appeared in FreeBSD 10.0 as part of the ctl(4)
driver. It was split off of ctl(4) in FreeBSD 12.0.
