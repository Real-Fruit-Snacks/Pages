NAME

fgetcmd, fget
&minus; download files from the FSP database

SYNOPSIS

fgetcmd
[-[f|o]|u|t|n|a|c|r|p] 
fgetcmd [-[f|o]|u|t|n|a|c|r|p] filename ...

fget
[-[f|o]|u|t|n|a|c|r|p] 
fget [-[f|o]|u|t|n|a|c|r|p] filename ...

DESCRIPTION

When used
without arguments, a list of file names is read from the
standard input. When arguments are given, the arguments are
taken to be the list of file names. For each file named in
the list, fgetcmd copies the file to the
client&rsquo;s current working directory in the client
machine. fgetcmd will perform csh file name
globbing based on file and directory information obtained
from the FSP database.

Since
user&rsquo;s command shells generally cannot do the proper
globbing for this program, it is recommended that user
defines a shell alias or function to turn off command shell
globbing before running this program. csh
example:

alias fget
\(set noglob\; exec fgetcmd \!\*\)

ARGUMENTS

-p --
preserve date/times of original file.

-f | -o
-- forces overwriting of files during an fget.

-u --
forces unique filenames (appends a unique integer to each
copy)

-t --
forces overwrite of local file if download is successful.
This has the drawback of possibly leaving behind temporary
files with names like .fsp.####

-n --
forces fgetcmd to refuse to overwrite files with
identical names.

-a | -c
-- forces fgetcmd to try and append data to a partial
file.

-r --
forces fgetcmd to recursively get all files in given
directories.

The default
mode is for fgetcmd is to create unique file
names.
