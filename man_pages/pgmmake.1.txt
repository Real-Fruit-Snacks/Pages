NAME
       pgmmake - create a PGM image of a specified gray level and dimensions

SYNOPSIS
       pgmmake [-maxval=maxval] graylevel width height

       All  options  can  be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.  You
       may use two hyphens instead of one to designate an option.  You may use
       either  white  space  or  an equals sign between an option name and its
       value.

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       pgmmake produces a PGM  image  of  the  specified  gray  level,  width,
       height, and maxval.

       Specify  the  gray level (graylevel) as a decimal floating point number
       in the range [0, 1].  E.g. 1 is white, 0 is black, and 0.5 is half  lu‐
       minosity gray.

EXAMPLES
           pgmmake 1 50 50

           pgmmake .2 50 100 -maxval=5

OPTIONS
       In  addition  to  the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm
       (most notably -quiet, see
        Common Options ⟨index.html#commonoptions⟩ ),  pgmmake  recognizes  the
       following command line option:

       -maxval=maxval
                   The maxval for the generated image.  Default is 255.
