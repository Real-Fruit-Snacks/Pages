NAME

cmap_dispatch -
Dispatches callbacks from the CMAP service

SYNOPSIS

#include

cs_error_t
cmap_dispatch (cmap_handle_t handle,
cs_dispatch_flags_t dispatch_types);

DESCRIPTION

The
cmap_dispatch function is used to dispatch
configuration changes.

Each
application may have several connections to the CMAP API.
Each application uses the handle argument to uniquely
identify the connection.

The
dispatch_types argument is used to identify the type
of dispatch to execute. The possible types are
CS_DISPATCH_ONE, CS_DISPATCH_ALL and
CS_DISPATCH_BLOCKING.

The dispatch
values have the following meanings: 
CS_DISPATCH_ONE

Dispatch at least one callback,
blocking until the callback is dispatched.

CS_DISPATCH_ALL

Dispatch all waiting callbacks
without blocking to wait for any callbacks.

CS_DISPATCH_BLOCKING

Dispatch all callbacks blocking
indefinitely. This is used in a threaded program where a
thread is created, and then cs_dispatch() is called
immediately from the created thread to execute
callbacks.

CS_DISPATCH_ONE_NONBLOCKING

Dispatch at most one callback.
If there is no pending callback, CS_ERR_TRY_AGAIN is
returned.

It&rsquo;s
needed to call cmap_track_add(3) to add tracked items
and receive callbacks.

RETURN VALUE

This call
returns the CS_OK value if successful, otherwise an error is
returned.
