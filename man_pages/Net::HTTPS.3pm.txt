NAME
       Net::HTTPS - Low-level HTTP over SSL/TLS connection (client)

VERSION
       version 6.22

DESCRIPTION
       The "Net::HTTPS" is a low-level HTTP over SSL/TLS client.  The
       interface is the same as the interface for "Net::HTTP", but the
       constructor takes additional parameters as accepted by IO::Socket::SSL.
       The "Net::HTTPS" object is an "IO::Socket::SSL" too, which makes it
       inherit additional methods from that base class.

       For historical reasons this module also supports using "Net::SSL" (from
       the Crypt-SSLeay distribution) as its SSL driver and base class.  This
       base is automatically selected if available and "IO::Socket::SSL"
       isn't.  You might also force which implementation to use by setting
       $Net::HTTPS::SSL_SOCKET_CLASS before loading this module.  If not set
       this variable is initialized from the "PERL_NET_HTTPS_SSL_SOCKET_CLASS"
       environment variable.

ENVIRONMENT
       You might set the "PERL_NET_HTTPS_SSL_SOCKET_CLASS" environment
       variable to the name of the base SSL implementation (and Net::HTTPS
       base class) to use.  The default is "IO::Socket::SSL".  Currently the
       only other supported value is "Net::SSL".
