NAME

lat_pagefault -
measure the cost of pagefaulting pages from a file

SYNOPSIS

lat_pagefault
[ -P  ] [ -W
 ] [ -N  ]
file [ file.... ]

DESCRIPTION

lat_pagefault
times how fast a page of a file can be faulted in. The file
is flushed from (local) memory by using the msync()
interface with the invalidate flag set. (Note that NFS does
not send this over the wire so this makes for a handy way to
measure the cost of going across the wire.)

The benchmark
maps in the entire file and the access pages backwards using
a stride of 256K kilobytes.

OUTPUT

Output format
is below; it prints the average cost of page faulting a
page.

Pagefaults
on :  usecs

BUGS

Using a stride
of 256K may be a bad idea because SCSI controllers may have
caches bigger than that.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

Funding for the
development of this tool was provided by Sun Microsystems
Computer Corporation.
