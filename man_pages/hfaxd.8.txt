NAME

hfaxd - Hyla
FAX client-server protocol server

SYNOPSIS

/usr/sbin/hfaxd
[ -d ] [ -q dir ] [ -o
port ] [ -O ] [ -l bindaddress ]
[ -i port ] [ -I ] [ -s
port ] [ -S ]

DESCRIPTION

hfaxd is
the Hyla FAX program that implements
the server portion of:

•

the client-server protocol and

•

the Simple Network Paging Protocol ( SNPP
) used to submit message pager jobs to the IXO/TAP and UCP
support. 

Additional
client-server protocols are planned and hfaxd is
intended to be the ’’carrier’’
through which they are supported.

hfaxd is
typically used in one of two ways; either as a standalone
process that is started at system boot time to listen for
client connections on one or more ports (in which case the
-i, -o, or -s option must be used), or as a subservient
process to the inetd(8) program. The two forms of use
may however be combined so long as the same service is not
provided both by the standalone hfaxd and through
inetd.

HYLAFAX (NEW) CLIENT-SERVER PROTOCOL SUPPORT

If hfaxd
is started with the -i option it will service clients
using the Hyla FAX client-server
protocol. This protocol is strongly related to the Internet
File Transfer Protocol ( FTP ); so much so in
fact that FTP client programs that include
support for ’’quoted commands’’ may
be used to communicate with hfaxd using the new
protocol. (It should also be possible to use
FTP -aware World Wide Web browsers such as
Mosaic and Netscape Navigator to access Hyla
FAX servers through the new protocol; but
the current format for information returned in directory
listings confuses them.)

The
hfaxd server currently recognizes the following
protocol requests; case is not distinguished. Entries marked
with a ¹ can be used only when the client has
established administrative privileges with
ADMIN .

The
hfaxd server will abort an active data transfer only
when the ABOR command is preceded by a Telnet
"Interrupt Process" (IP) signal and a Telnet
"Synch" signal in the command Telnet stream, as
described in Internet RFC 959. If a
STAT command is received during a data
transfer, preceded by a Telnet IP and Synch, transfer status
will be returned.

SIMPLE NETWORK PAGING PROTOCOL (SNPP) SUPPORT

If hfaxd
is started with the -s option it will service clients
using the Simple Network Pager Protocol (
SNPP ) as specified in RFC
1861 (which obsoletes RFC 1645).

The
hfaxd server currently recognizes the
SNPP protocol requests listed below. Requests
marked with a ¹ are non-standard extensions to
RFC 1861 that may be added to
SNPP at some future time. Case is not
distinguished and only the first four characters of requests
are used in identifying commands.

Note that
hfaxd requires that SNPP clients login
first with the LOGI directive while
RFC 1861 permits clients to submit pages
anonymously.

CLIENT ACCESS CONTROL

hfaxd
controls client access according to the information in the
file /var/spool/hylafax/etc/hosts.hfaxd. This file
defines the set of users and machines that may receive
service and, optionally, defines password challenges to use
in authenticating clients. Clients may be permitted access
to services with or without a password challenge. Access may
also be restricted based on the host machine that a request
for service originates from. Consult hosts.hfaxd(5)
for information on the format and content of this file. The
SITE ADDUSER protocol request is provided for
adding new users to a server (available only to clients with
administrative privileges).

Server
resources are controlled based on clients’ identities.
Jobs and documents, both received and submitted, are
protected by the server. Typically clients are permitted
access to anything they own or that is publicly accessible.
There are also administrative privileges that clients may
acquire and which permit them wide access to objects that
reside on the server.

A complete
client-server protocol specification is still
outstanding.

hfaxd
operates with its root directory set to the top of the
Hyla FAX spooling area;
/var/spool/hylafax. This is done so that clients see a
virtual file hierarchy that is completely contained within
the Hyla FAX operating environment on
the server machine. Administrators however must be aware of
this action when specifying files in the hfaxd
configuration file: absolute pathnames relative to the root
of the spooling should be used to specify filenames.

SERVER ACCESS CONTROL

The file
/var/spool/hylafax/etc/shutdown, when present,
specifies when to restrict access to a server machine. When
this file is present and contains valid information
hfaxd will permit only users with administrative
privileges to access the server. Any other users that
request service will be denied access and negative server
responses will include any shutdown message specified in the
shutdown file. Consult hylafax-shutdown(5) for
information on the format and content of this file.

The
SHUT protocol request can be used to schedule
a server shutdown; it is available only to clients with
administrative privileges. To make a shutdown server
available again the shutdown file can be deleted with the
DELE protocol request (this is to be
replaced with an ’’unshut’’ protocol
request so that implementation details are not part of the
protocol).

CONFIGURATION FILES

hfaxd
reads configuration information from the file
/etc/hylafax/hfaxd.conf each time a new server
process is started (i.e. for each new client). This file
uses the same conventions used by other Hyla
FAX configuration files; as described in
hylafax-config(5). The following configuration
parameters are recognized; items marked ’’(
SNPP )’’ are used only by the
SNPP support.

to change the server sort the listings.

FaxContact

The e-mail address to display
as a point of contact in the help text returned to a client
in response to the HELP or SITE
HELP commands. By default this is
’’FaxMaster@hostname’’, where
hostname is the fully qualified name for the machine
where the server is running.

FileFmt

The format string to use when returning file status
information with the LIST and
STAT commands. Formats are specified using
printf(3S) style conventions but using the field
identifiers listed below. Each item can include field width,
precision, left-justification, 0-filling, etc. just as for
printf; e.g. %-8p for an 8-character wide,
left-justified, blank-padded field containing the file
protection flags.

include a field width so that client applications that
construct headers from the format string can constrain the
width of column title strings.

FileSortFmt

The format string to use when
sorting the listing for directories using the LIST command.
Follows the FileFmt formatting rules.

IdleTimeout

The initial/default timeout to
use in timing out idle clients. This value defines the
maximum amount of time (in seconds) that hfaxd will
wait for a command from a client before terminating the
connection. Unprivileged clients may alter the idle timeout
up to the value of MaxIdleTimeout; privileged clients
may set the timeout to any value.

JobFmt

The format string to use when returning job status
information for jobs in the sendq and doneq
directories. Formats are specified using printf(3S)
style conventions but using the field identifiers listed
below. Each item can include field width, precision,
left-justification, 0-filling, etc. just as for

The default
format string is ’’%-4j %3i %1a %6.6o %-12.12e
%5P %5D %7z %.25s’’. This string constrains each
status line to be less than 80 characters. It is recommended
that all items include a field width so that client
applications, such as faxstat(1) that construct
headers from the format string can constrain the width of
column title strings.

JobSortFmt

The format string to use when
sorting the listing for jobs in the sendq and doneq
directories. Follows the JobFmt formatting rules.

JobProtection

The file mode setting for job
qfiles in the Hyla FAX queues (sendq
and doneq). The default setting of
’’0644’’ allows all users to view
all job parameters in the send/done queues. If
PublicJobQ is set to false, then this file mode
determines the permissions of the clients to see the jobs,
following the Hyla FAX permission
model of the group bits controlling uid permissions and the
other bits controlling other permissions.

KillTimeMap

The mapping from
SNPP service level (0-11) to job expiration
time (kill time). A mapping is specified as a string of
space-separate numbers where each value is the number of
minutes to permit a job to run. The default mapping is
’’5 5 5 15 60 240 720 1440 1440 1440 1440
1440’’ which expires a job in 5 minutes for
service levels 0-2, 15 minutes for level three, 60 minutes
for level four, etc.

LogFacility

The symbolic name for the
syslog(3) facility to use when logging error messages
and informational/debugging messages requested through the
ServerTracing parameter. The list of facility names
is found in the system include file ;
comparisons are case-insensitive.

MaxAdminAttempts

The maximum number of
unsuccessful attempts gain administrative privileges with
the ADMIN command that hfaxd will
permit a client before terminating the connection. Note that
the count of attempts is reset if/when the client
successfully gains administrative privileges.

MaxConsecutiveBadCmds

The maximum number of
consecutive unrecognized, unimplemented, syntactically
incorrect, or otherwise unacceptable commands to permit a
client before terminating the connection. This control has
two purposes: to handle naive or malicious clients from
sending long streams of nonsense commands to a server, and
to insure that clients are forcibly terminated when a server
is marked shutdown.

MaxIdleTimeout

The maximum value that a client
may set the idle timeout to. This value is not enforced if
the client has administrative privileges.

MaxLoginAttempts

The maximum number of
unsuccessful attempts to login with the USER
and PASS commands that hfaxd will
permit a client before terminating the connection.

MaxMsgLength

The maximum number of
characters to accept in a pager message specified with the
DATA or MESS commands.
Messages longer than this value are rejected.

ModemFmt

The format string to use when returning modem status
information for modems listed in the status
directory. Formats are specified using printf(3S)
style conventions but using the field identifiers listed
below. Each item can include field width, precision,
left-justification, 0-filling, etc. just as for
printf; e.g. %-8h for an 8-character wide,
left-justified, blank-padded field containing the name of
the host the server is running on.

Format
Description

h

Server hostname

l

Local identifier string

m

Canonical modem name

n

FAX phone number

r

Maximum pages that can be received in a single call

s

Status information string

t

Server and session tracing levels (xxxxx:yyyyy)

v

Modem speaker volume as one-character symbol

z

A ’’*’’ if a faxgetty(8)
process is running; otherwise ’’ ’’
(space) 

The default
format string is ’’Modem %m (%n):
%s’’.

ModemSortFmt

The format string to use when
sorting the listsin for modem status information in the
status directory.

PagerIDMapFile

The absolute pathname of the
file that contains directions for mapping pager identifiers
to IXO/TAP or UCP service
providers (and optionally a pager identification number).
Consult pagermap(5) for information on the format and
content of this file. (Note that absolute pathnames are
relative to the root of the spooling area).

PriorityMap

The mapping from
SNPP service level (0-11) to job scheduling
priority. A mapping is specified as a string of
space-separate numbers where each value is the priority to
assign to a job. The default mapping is ’’63 127
127 127 127 127 127 127 127 127 127 127’’ which
assigns a high priority to service level zero and normal
(default) priority to all other service levels.

PublicJobQ

By default, HylaFAX has always
made the listings of the sendq/doneq include all jobs to any
client connected to hfaxd. By setting this to false, hfaxd
will also enforce it’s normal access restrictions on
the listing of jobs in the sendq/doneq. These access
restrictions are based on the file mode (see
JobProtection ) and the logged in uid (see
hosts.hfaxd )

PublicRecvQ

By default, HylaFAX has always
made the listings of the recvq include all faxes to any
client connected to hfaxd. By setting this to false, hfaxd
will also enforce it’s normal access restrictions on
the listing of faxes in the recvq. These access restrictions
are based on the file mode faxgetty (and it’s
related FaxDispatch ) set for the fax, and the logged
in uid (see hosts.hfaxd )

RcvFmt

The format string to use when
returning status information for received facsimile in the
recvq directory. Formats are specified using
printf(3S) style conventions but using the field
identifiers listed below. Each item can include field width,
precision, left-justification, 0-filling, etc. just as for
printf; e.g. %-3b for a 3-character wide,
left-justified, blank-padded field containing the signalling
rate. 

Format
Description

a

SubAddress received from sender (if any)

b

Signalling rate used during receive

d

Data format used during receive

e

Error description if an error occurred during
receive 

f

Document filename (relative to the recvq
directory) 

h

Time spent receiving document (HH:MM:SS)

l

Page length in mm

m

Fax-style protection mode string
(’’-rwxrwx’’) 

n

A ’’*’’ if receive is going on;
otherwise ’’ ’’ (space)

The default
format string is ’’%-7m %4p%1z %-8.8o %14.14s
%7t %f’’. This string constrains each status
line to be less than 80 characters. It is recommended that
all items include a field width so that client applications,
such as faxstat(1) that construct headers from the
format string can constrain the width of column title
strings.

RcvSortFmt

The format string to use when
sorting the listing for received facsimile in the recvq
directory. Follows the RcvFmt formatting rules.

RetryTimeMap

The mapping from
SNPP service level (0-11) to job retry time.
A mapping is specified as a string of space-separate numbers
where each value is the number of seconds to delay between
delivery attempts. A value of zero causes retries to be
scheduled using the default algorithm used by the Hyla
FAX job scheduler. The default mapping is
’’30 60 60 180 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0’’
which retries a level 0 job after a 30 second delay, levels
1 and 2 after 60 seconds, level 3 after 3 minutes, and other
jobs are retried according to the usual scheduling
algorithm.

ServerTracing

A number that controls the
generation of tracing information by a server. areas
that are individually controlled. To enable tracing of
multiple areas of operation, the flag associated with each
area should be bit-or’d to form the value for this
tag.

Flag

Description

1 (0x00001)

General server operation

2 (0x00002)

Client-server protocol requests and responses

4 (0x00004)

File transfers from client to server

8 (0x00008)

File transfers from server to client

16 (0x00010)

Client logins

32 (0x00020)

All network connections

FIFO messages to and from
faxq(8) 

128 (0x00080)

TIFF Library errors and warnings

256 (0x00100)

Configuration file processing

Tracing
messages are directed to syslog(3) using the
facility specified with the LogFacility
configuration parameter. Note that syslogd(8) must be
configured to capture facility.info,
facility.debug, facility.warning, and
facility.err messages.

ShutdownFile

The absolute pathname of the
server shutdown file; see hylafax-shutdown(5) for
information on the format and content of this file. (Note
that absolute pathnames are relative to the root of the
spooling area).

UserAccessFile

The absolute pathname of the
user access control file; see hosts.hfaxd(5) for
information on the format and content of this file. (Note
that absolute pathnames are relative to the root of the
spooling area).

XferLogFile

The absolute pathname of the
file to use for logging client-server file transfers (when
enabled through the ServerTracing parameter). (Note
that absolute pathnames are relative to the root of the
spooling area).

OPTIONS

-q dir

The specified directory is
treated as the spooling area. The default spooling area,
/var/spool/hylafax, is defined at the time the
software is built.

-d

Stop hfaxd from detaching itself from the
controlling terminal. This option is normally used only when
running hfaxd under a debugger or when hfaxd
is started up from the inetd(8) process.

-l
bindaddress

Bind to the specified
bindaddress the tcp port. Please note that this
argument need to be specified before the -i otherwise
it will be ignored. A better approach to improve security
would be to run hfaxd from xinetd, binding its service to
the specific port. This will also make hylafax benefits from
tcp wrappers and other options provided by xinetd.

-i port

Listen on the specified port for service requests
and respond with the client-server protocol. The port may be
specified either symbolically, e.g.
’’hylafax’’ or numerically. This
flag may be specified multiple times to request service on
multiple different ports. Each time this flag is specified,
it will listen on the specified port, bound to the last
-l bindaddress specified. If no -l
bindaddress was specified, it will bind to the system
configured default wildcard address, which could be any of
IPv6, or IPv4, or both.

-s port

Listen on the specified port for service requests
and respond with the Simple Network Paging (SNPP) protocol.
The port may be specified either symbolically, e.g.
’’snpp’’ or numerically. This flag
may be specified multiple times to request service on
multiple different ports.

-I

Service the client-server protocol using the standard
input and output. This option is useful when hfaxd is
started up by inetd(8).

-S

Service the Simple Network Paging (SNPP) protocol using
the standard input and output. This option is useful when
hfaxd is started up by inetd(8).

DIAGNOSTICS

Diagnostics
generated by hfaxd are logged using
syslog(3).
