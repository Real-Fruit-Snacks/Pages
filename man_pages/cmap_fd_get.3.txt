NAME

cmap_fd_get -
Dispatches callbacks from the CMAP service

SYNOPSIS

#include

cs_error_t
cmap_fd_get (cmap_handle_t handle, int
*fd);

DESCRIPTION

The
cmap_fd_get function is used to retrieve the file
descriptor that may be used with the poll system call to
determine when cmap_dispatch(3) won&rsquo;t block.
The handle argument may not be used directly with
poll because it is not the file descriptor, but
instead an internal identifier used by the CMAP library.

RETURN VALUE

This call
returns the CS_OK value if successful, otherwise an error is
returned.
