NAME

nbd_aio_command_completed
- check if the command completed

SYNOPSIS

#include

int nbd_aio_command_completed ( 
struct nbd_handle *h, uint64_t cookie 
);

DESCRIPTION

Return true if
the command completed. If this function returns true then
the command was successful and it has been retired. Return
false if the command is still in flight. This can also fail
with an error in case the command failed (in this case the
command is also retired). A command is retired either via
this command, or by using a completion callback which
returns 1.

The
"cookie" parameter is the positive unique 64 bit
cookie for the command, as returned by a call such as
nbd_aio_pread(3).

RETURN VALUE

This call
returns a boolean value.

ERRORS

On error -1 is
returned.

Refer to
"ERROR HANDLING" in libnbd(3) for how to
get further details of the error.

The following
parameters must not be NULL: "h". For more
information see "Non-NULL parameters" in
libnbd(3).

VERSION

This function
first appeared in libnbd 1.0.

If you need to
test if this function is available at compile time check if
the following macro is defined:

#define
LIBNBD_HAVE_NBD_AIO_COMMAND_COMPLETED 1
