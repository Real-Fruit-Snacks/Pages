DESCRIPTION

The
autotrace program accepts bitmap graphics from the
file inputfile specified on the command line, and as
output produces a collection of splines approximating the
original image, the converting the image from bitmap to
vector format. It behaves in a manner similar to the
commercial software known as *tream*ine or *orel*race. The
result is sent to standard output unless the
&minus;output-file option is active.

OPTIONS

Options can
begin with either &minus;&minus; or &minus;.
Any unambiguous abbreviation can be used for the option
name. Option names and values can be separated with either a
space or equal sign (=). 
&minus;background-color hexvalue

Employ the color specified by
the hexadecimal code hexcode as the background that
should be ignored, for example FFFFFF (default: no
background color).

&minus;centerline

Trace an object&rsquo;s
centerline (default: employ its outline).

&minus;color-count
int

Reduce the bitmap to using the
number of colors specified by the unsigned integer
int (range: 1-256). The default value of 0 indicates
that no color reduction is to be done. Does not work with
grayscale images.

&minus;corner-always-threshold
angle

Consider any angle at a pixel
which falls below the specified angle (in degrees) as
a corner, even if it is bordered by other corner pixels
(default: 60).

&minus;corner-surround
int

Consider the specified number
of pixels on either side of a point when determining if that
point is a corner (default: 4).

&minus;corner-threshold
angle

Consider any pixel which forms
an angle with its predecessor(s) and successor(s) that is
smaller than the specified angle (in degrees) as a
corner (default: 100).

&minus;despeckle-level
int

Employ the specified integer
(range: 1-20) as the value for despeckling (default: no
despeckling).

&minus;despeckle-tightness
real

Employ the specified real
number (range: 0.0-8.0) as the value for despeckle tightness
(default: 2.0).

&minus;dpi
int

The dots per inch value in the
input image, affects scaling of mif output image.

&minus;error-threshold
real

Subdivide fitted curves that
are offset by a number of pixels exceeding the specified
real number (default: 2.0).

&minus;filter-iterations
int

Smooth the curve the specified
number of times prior to fitting (default: 4).

&minus;help

Print a help message and exit.

&minus;input-format
format

Employ the specified input
format, where format is one of: 
BMP (Windows bitmap format) 
PBM (Portable BitMap format) 
PGM (Portable Graymap format) 
PNM (Portable Anymap format) 
PPM (Portable Pixmap format) 
TGA (Targa format)

The supported
input formats are determined when the application is built
and depend upon the availability of other software (the
&minus;list-input-formats command can be used to
determine which are supported locally).

&minus;line-reversion-threshold
real

When a spline is closer to a
straight line than the specified real number weighted by the
square of the curve length (default: .01), maintain it as a
straight line, even if it is a list with curves.

&minus;line-threshold
real

If a spline does not deviate
from the straight line defined by its endpoints by more than
the specified number of pixels, then treat it as a straight
line (default: 1).

&minus;list-input-formats

Send a list of the supported
input formats to stderr.

&minus;list-output-formats

Send a list of the supported
output formats to stderr.

&minus;log

Send a detailed progress report to the file
inputfile.log. 

&minus;output-file
file

Send the output to the
specified file.

&minus;output-format
format

Employ the specified output
format, where format is one of: 
ai(Adobe Illustrator) 
cgm(Computer Graphics Metafile) 
dr2d(IFF DR2D format, used almost exclusively on Amiga

platforms) 
dxf(AutoCAD Drawing Exchange format) 
emf(Windows Enhanced Metafile format) 
epd(Encapsulated Vectorial Graphics format) 
eps(Encapsulated PostScript) 
er(Elastic Reality Shape format) 
fig(xfig (1) 3.2) 
mif(FrameMaker MIF format) 
pdf(Portable Data Format) 
p2e(pstoedit (1) frontend) 
sk(Sketch) 
svg(Scalable Vector Graphics) 
swf(Shockwave Flash 3)

The supported
output formats are determined when the application is built
and depend upon the availability of other software (the
&minus;list-output-formats command can be used to
determine which are supported locally).

&minus;preserve-width

Whether to preserve line width
prior to thinning.

&minus;remove-adjacent-corners

Remove adjacent corners.

&minus;report-progress

Report tracing status in real
time.

&minus;debug-arch

Print the type of cpu.

&minus;debug-bitmap

Dump loaded bitmap to
.bitmap.

&minus;tangent-surround
int

Consider the specified number
of points to either side of a point when computing the
tangent at that point (default: 3).

&minus;version

Print the version number of the
program and exit.

&minus;width-factor
real

Weight factor for fitting the
linewidth.
