NAME

idmapd.conf -
configuration file for libnfsidmap

SYNOPSIS

Configuration
file for libnfsidmap. Used by idmapd and svcgssd to map
NFSv4 name to and from ids.

DESCRIPTION

The
idmapd.conf configuration file consists of several
sections, initiated by strings of the form [General] and
[Mapping]. Each section may contain lines of the form 
variable = value 
The recognized sections and their recognized variables are
as follows:

[General]
section variables 
Verbosity

Verbosity level of debugging
(Default: 0)

Domain

The local NFSv4 domain name. An NFSv4 domain is a
namespace with a unique usernameUID and
groupnameGID mapping. (Default: Host&rsquo;s
fully-qualified DNS domain name)

No-Strip

In multi-domain environments,
some NFS servers will append the identity management domain
to the owner and owner_group in lieu of a true NFSv4 domain.
This option can facilitate lookups in such environments. If
set to a value other than "none", the nsswitch
plugin will first pass the name to the password/group lookup
function without stripping the domain off. If that mapping
fails then the plugin will try again using the old method
(comparing the domain in the string to the Domain value,
stripping it if it matches, and passing the resulting short
name to the lookup function). Valid values are
"user", "group", "both", and
"none". (Default: "none")

Reformat-Group

Winbind has a quirk whereby
doing a group lookup in UPN format (e.g.
staff [AT] americas.com) will cause the group to be
displayed prefixed with the full domain in uppercase (e.g.
AMERICAS.EXAMPLE.COM\staff) instead of in the familiar
netbios name format (e.g. AMERICAS\staff). Setting this
option to true causes the name to be reformatted before
passing it to the group lookup function in order to work
around this. This setting is ignored unless No-Strip is set
to either "both" or "group". (Default:
"false")

Local-Realms

A comma-separated list of
Kerberos realm names that may be considered equivalent to
the local realm name. For example, users juser [AT] ORDER.EDU and
juser [AT] MAIL.EDU may be considered to be the same user
in the specified Domain. (Default: the host&rsquo;s
default realm name) 
Note: If a value is specified here, the default local
realm must be included as well.

[Mapping]
section variables 
Nobody-User

Local user name to be used when
a mapping cannot be completed.

Nobody-Group

Local group name to be used
when a mapping cannot be completed.

[Translation]
section variables

Method

A comma-separated, ordered list of mapping methods
(plug-ins) to use when mapping between NFSv4 names and local
IDs. Each specified method is tried in order until a mapping
is found, or there are no more methods to try. The methods
included in the default distribution include
"nsswitch", "umich_ldap", and
"static". (Default: nsswitch)

GSS-Methods

An optional comma-separated,
ordered list of mapping methods (plug-ins) to use when
mapping between GSS Authenticated names and local IDs.
(Default: the same list as specified for Method)

[Static]
section variables 
The "static" translation method uses a static list
of GSS-Authenticated names to local user names. Entries in
the list are of the form: 
principal@REALM = localusername

[REGEX]
section variables 
If the "regex" translation method is specified,
the following variables within the [REGEX] section are used
to map between NFS4 names and local IDs. 
User-Regex

Case-insensitive regular
expression that extracts the local user name from an NFSv4
name. Multiple expressions may be concatenated with
&rsquo;|&rsquo;. The first match will be used. There is no
default. A basic regular expression for domain DOMAIN.ORG
and realm MY.DOMAIN.ORG would be: 
^DOMAIN\([^@]+)@MY.DOMAIN.ORG$

Group-Regex

Case-insensitive regular
expression that extracts the local group name from an NFSv4
name. Multiple expressions may be concatenated with
&rsquo;|&rsquo;. The first match will be used. There is no
default. A basic regular expression for domain DOMAIN.ORG
and realm MY.DOMAIN.ORG would be: 

^([^@]+)@DOMAIN.ORG [AT] MY.ORG$|^DOMAIN\([^@]+)@MY.DOMAIN.ORG$

Prepend-Before-User

Constant string to put before a
local user name when building an NFSv4 name. Usually this is
the short domain name followed by &rsquo;&acute;. (Default:
none)

Append-After-User

Constant string to put after a
local user name when building an NFSv4 name. Usually this is
&rsquo;@&rsquo; followed by the default realm. (Default:
none)

Prepend-Before-Group

Constant string to put before a
local group name when building an NFSv4 name. Usually not
used. (Default: none)

Append-After-Group

Constant string to put before a
local group name when building an NFSv4 name. Usually this
is &rsquo;@&rsquo; followed by the domain name followed by
another &rsquo;@&rsquo; and the default realm. (Default:
none)

Group-Name-Prefix

Constant string that is
prepended to a local group name when converting it to an
NFSv4 name. If an NFSv4 group name has this prefix it is
removed when converting it to a local group name. With this
group names of a central directory can be shortened for an
isolated organizational unit if all groups have a common
prefix. (Default: none)

Group-Name-No-Prefix-Regex

Case-insensitive regular
expression to exclude groups from adding and removing the
prefix set by Group-Name-Prefix. The regular
expression must match both the remote and local group names.
Multiple expressions may be concatenated with
&rsquo;|&rsquo;. (Default: none)

[UMICH_SCHEMA]
section variables 
If the "umich_ldap" translation method is
specified, the following variables within the [UMICH_SCHEMA]
section are used.

server hostname should be canonicalised. If set to yes LDAP
lib with do a reverse hostname lookup. If this is not set
the LDAP library&rsquo;s default will be used. (Default:
None)

LDAP_sasl_krb5_ccname

Path to kerberos credential
cache. If it is not set then the value of environment
variable KRB5CCNAME will be used. If the environment
variable is not set then the default mechanism of kerberos
library will be used.

people accounts in your local LDAP schema (Default:
NFSv4RemotePerson)

NFSv4_name_attr

attribute name to be used for NFSv4 user names (Default:

attribute name to be used for uidNumber (Default:
uidNumber)

GSS_principal_attr

gidNumber)

NFSv4_group_attr

Your local schema&rsquo;s
attribute name to be used for NFSv4 group names (Default:

LDAP_use_memberof_for_groups

Some LDAP servers do a better
job with indexing where searching through all the groups
searching for the user in the memberuid list. Others like
SunOne directory that search can takes minutes if there are
thousands of groups. So setting
LDAP_use_memberof_for_groups to true in the
configuration file will use the memberof lists of the
account and search through only those groups to obtain gids.
(Default: false)

NFSv4_member_attr

If
LDAP_use_memberof_for_groups is true, this is the
attribute to be searched for. (Default: memberUid)

NFSv4_grouplist_filter

An optional search filter for
determining group membership. (No Default)
