NAME

ntlm_auth -
tool to allow external access to Winbind's NTLM
authentication function

SYNOPSIS

ntlm_auth

DESCRIPTION

This tool is
part of the samba(7) suite.

ntlm_auth is a
helper utility that authenticates users using NT/LM
authentication. It returns 0 if the users is authenticated
successfully and 1 if access was denied. ntlm_auth uses
winbind to access the user and authentication data for a
domain. This utility is only intended to be used by other
programs (currently Squid and mod_ntlm_winbind).

OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS

The
winbindd(8) daemon must be operational for many of
these commands to function.

Some of these
commands also require access to the directory
winbindd_privileged in $LOCKDIR. This should be done either
by running this command as root or providing group access to
the winbindd_privileged directory. For security reasons,
this directory should not be world-accessable.

OPTIONS

--helper-protocol=PROTO

Operate as a stdio-based
helper. Valid helper protocols are:

squid-2.4-basic

Server-side helper for use with
Squid 2.4's basic (plaintext) authentication.

squid-2.5-basic

Server-side helper for use with
Squid 2.5's basic (plaintext) authentication.

squid-2.5-ntlmssp

Server-side helper for use with
Squid 2.5's NTLMSSP authentication.

Requires access
to the directory winbindd_privileged in $LOCKDIR. The
protocol used is described here:
http://devel.squid-cache.org/ntlm/squid_helper_protocol.html.
This protocol has been extended to allow the NTLMSSP
Negotiate packet to be included as an argument to the YR
command. (Thus avoiding loss of information in the protocol
exchange).

ntlmssp-client-1

Client-side helper for use with
arbitrary external programs that may wish to use Samba's
NTLMSSP authentication knowledge.

This helper is
a client, and as such may be run by any user. The protocol
used is effectively the reverse of the previous protocol. A
YR command (without any arguments) starts the authentication
exchange.

gss-spnego

Server-side helper that
implements GSS-SPNEGO. This uses a protocol that is almost
the same as squid-2.5-ntlmssp, but has some subtle
differences that are undocumented outside the source at this
stage.

Requires access
to the directory winbindd_privileged in $LOCKDIR.

gss-spnego-client

Client-side helper that
implements GSS-SPNEGO. This also uses a protocol similar to
the above helpers, but is currently undocumented.

ntlm-server-1

Server-side helper protocol,
intended for use by a RADIUS server or the 'winbind' plugin
for pppd, for the provision of MSCHAP and MSCHAPv2
authentication.

This protocol
consists of lines in the form: Parameter: value and
Parameter:: Base64-encode value. The presence of a single
period . indicates that one side has finished supplying data
to the other. (Which in turn could cause the helper to
authenticate the user).

Currently
implemented parameters from the external program to the
helper are:

Username

The username, expected to be in
Samba's unix
charset.

Examples:

Username:
bob

Username::
Ym9i

NT-Domain

The
user's domain, expected to be in Samba's
unix
charset.

Examples:

NT-Domain:
WORKGROUP

NT-Domain::
V09SS0dST1VQ

Full-Username

The fully
qualified username, expected to be in Samba's
unix charset
and qualified with the
winbind
separator.

Examples:

Full-Username:
WORKGROUP\bob

Full-Username::
V09SS0dST1VQYm9i

LANMAN-Challenge

The 8
byte LANMAN Challenge value, generated randomly by the
server, or (in cases such as MSCHAPv2) generated in some way
by both the server and the client.

Examples:

LANMAN-Challenge:
0102030405060708

LANMAN-Response

The 24
byte LANMAN Response value, calculated from the user's
password and the supplied LANMAN Challenge. Typically, this
is provided over the network by a client wishing to
authenticate.

Examples:

LANMAN-Response:
0102030405060708090A0B0C0D0E0F101112131415161718

NT-Response

The >=
24 byte NT Response calculated from the user's password and
the supplied LANMAN Challenge. Typically, this is provided
over the network by a client wishing to
authenticate.

Examples:

NT-Response:
0102030405060708090A0B0C0D0E0F10111213141516171

Password

The
user's password. This would be provided by a network client,
if the helper is being used in a legacy situation that
exposes plaintext passwords in this way.

Examples:

Password:
samba2

Password::
c2FtYmEy

Request-User-Session-Key

Upon
successful authentication, return the user session key
associated with the login.

Examples:

Request-User-Session-Key:
Yes

Request-LanMan-Session-Key

Upon
successful authentication, return the LANMAN session key
associated with the login.

Examples:

Request-LanMan-Session-Key:
Yes

Warning

Implementers should take care to base64 encode any data
(such as usernames/passwords) that may contain malicious
user data, such as a newline. They may also need to decode
strings from the helper, which likewise may have been base64
encoded.

--username=USERNAME

Specify
username of user to authenticate

--domain=DOMAIN

Specify
domain of user to authenticate

--workstation=WORKSTATION

Specify
the workstation the user authenticated from

--challenge=STRING

NTLM
challenge (in HEXADECIMAL)

--lm-response=RESPONSE

LM
Response to the challenge (in HEXADECIMAL)

--nt-response=RESPONSE

NT
or NTLMv2 Response to the challenge (in
HEXADECIMAL)

--password=PASSWORD

User's
plaintext password

If
not specified on the command line, this is prompted for when
required.

For
the NTLMSSP based server roles, this parameter specifies the
expected password, allowing testing without winbindd
operational.

--request-lm-key

Retrieve
LM session key

--request-nt-key

Request
NT key

--diagnostics

Perform
Diagnostics on the authentication chain. Uses the password
from --password or prompts for one.

--require-membership-of={SID|Name}

Require
that a user be a member of specified group (either name or
SID) for authentication to succeed.

--pam-winbind-conf=FILENAME

Define
the path to the pam_winbind.conf file.

--target-hostname=HOSTNAME

Define
the target hostname.

--target-service=SERVICE

Define
the target service.

--use-cached-creds

Whether
to use credentials cached by winbindd.

--allow-mschapv2

Explicitly
allow MSCHAPv2.

--offline-logon

Allow
offline logons for plain text auth.

-?|--help

Print
a summary of command line options.

--usage

Display
brief usage message.

-d|--debuglevel=DEBUGLEVEL

level
is an integer from 0 to 10. The default value if this
parameter is not specified is 1 for client
applications.

The
higher this value, the more detail will be logged to the log
files about the activities of the server. At level 0, only
critical errors and serious warnings will be logged. Level 1
is a reasonable level for day-to-day running - it generates
a small amount of information about operations carried
out.

Levels
above 1 will generate considerable amounts of log data, and
should only be used when investigating a problem. Levels
above 3 are designed for use only by developers and generate
HUGE amounts of log data, most of which is extremely
cryptic.

Note
that specifying this parameter here will override
the log
level parameter in the
/etc/samba/smb.conf file.

--debug-stdout

This
will redirect debug output to STDOUT. By default all clients
are logging to STDERR.

--configfile=

The
file specified contains the configuration details required
by the client. The information in this file can be general
for client and server or only provide client specific like
options such as client smb
encrypt. See
/etc/samba/smb.conf for more information. The default
configuration file name is determined at compile
time.

--option==

Set
the smb.conf(5) option "" to
value "" from the command line. This
overrides compiled-in defaults and options read from the
configuration file. If a name or a value includes a space,
wrap whole --option=name=value into quotes.

-V|--version

Prints
the program version number.

EXAMPLE SETUP

To
setup ntlm_auth for use by squid 2.5, with both basic and
NTLMSSP authentication, the following should be placed in
the squid.conf file.

auth_param
ntlm program ntlm_auth --helper-protocol=squid-2.5-ntlmssp

auth_param basic program ntlm_auth
--helper-protocol=squid-2.5-basic 
auth_param basic children 5 
auth_param basic realm Squid proxy-caching web server 
auth_param basic credentialsttl 2 hours

Note

This example assumes that ntlm_auth has been installed into
your path, and that the group permissions on
winbindd_privileged are as described above.

To
setup ntlm_auth for use by squid 2.5 with group limitation
in addition to the above example, the following should be
added to the squid.conf file.

auth_param
ntlm program ntlm_auth --helper-protocol=squid-2.5-ntlmssp
--require-membership-of='WORKGROUP\Domain Users' 
auth_param basic program ntlm_auth
--helper-protocol=squid-2.5-basic
--require-membership-of='WORKGROUP\Domain
Users'
