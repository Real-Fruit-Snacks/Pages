NAME
       Net::DBus::Binding::Message::MethodCall - a message encoding a method
       call

DESCRIPTION
       This module is part of the low-level DBus binding APIs, and should not
       be used by application code. No guarantees are made about APIs under
       the "Net::DBus::Binding::" namespace being stable across releases.

       This module provides a convenience constructor for creating a message
       representing a method call.

METHODS
       my $call = Net::DBus::Binding::Message::MethodCall->new( service_name
       => $service, object_path => $object, interface => $interface,
       method_name => $name);
           Create a message representing a call on the object located at the
           path "object_path" within the client owning the well-known name
           given by "service_name". The method to be invoked has the name
           "method_name" within the interface specified by the "interface"
           parameter.
