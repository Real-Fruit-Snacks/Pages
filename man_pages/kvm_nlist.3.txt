NAME

kvm_nlist
&minus; get entries from kernel symbol table

SYNOPSIS

#include

#include 

int
kvm_nlist(kvm_t *kd, struct nlist
*nl);

DESCRIPTION

kvm_nlist()
examines the symbol table from the kernel image identified
by kd (see kvm_open(3KVM)) and selectively
extracts a list of values and puts them in the array of
nlist structures pointed to by nl. The name
list pointed to by nl consists of an array of
structures containing names, types and values. The
n_name field of each such structure is taken to be a
pointer to a character string representing a symbol name.
The list is terminated by an entry with a NULL
pointer (or a pointer to a null string) in the n_name
field. For each entry in nl, if the named symbol is
present in the kernel symbol table, its value and type are
placed in the n_value and n_type fields. If a
symbol cannot be located, the corresponding n_type
field of nl is set to zero.

RETURN VALUES

kvm_nlist()
returns the value of nlist(3UCB) or
nlist(3ELF), depending on the library used.
