NAME
       deb-postrm - package post-removal maintainer script

SYNOPSIS
       DEBIAN/postrm

DESCRIPTION
       A package can perform several post-removal actions via maintainer
       scripts, by including an executable postrm file in its control archive
       (i.e. DEBIAN/postrm during package creation).

       The script can be called in the following ways:

       postrm remove
           After the package was removed.

       postrm purge
           After the package was purged.

       old-postrm upgrade new-version
           After the package was upgraded.

       new-postrm failed-upgrade old-version new-version
           If the above upgrade call fails.

           The new-version is passed only since dpkg 1.18.5.

       postrm disappear overwriter-package overwriter-version
           After all of the packages files have been replaced.

       new-postrm abort-install
           If preinst fails during install.

       new-postrm abort-install old-version new-version
           If preinst fails during install for an upgrade of a removed
           package.

           The new-version is passed only since dpkg 1.18.5.

       new-postrm abort-upgrade old-version new-version
           If preinst fails during upgrade.

           The new-version is passed only since dpkg 1.18.5.
