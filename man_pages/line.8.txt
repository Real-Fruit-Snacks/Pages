NAME

line - cache
line size

SYNOPSIS

line [
-M  ] [ -W  ] [
-N  ]

DESCRIPTION

line
tries to determine the cache line size in bytes of the
largest cache which is smaller than len bytes.

line
creates pointer chains which access the first word on each
cache line on a page (randomly meandering through all the
lines in a page before jumping to the next page). It
measures the average memory latency for a variety of line
sizes, starting with a line size of one word. When it finds
an increase in the average latency that is significantly
larger than the latency for the smaller line size then it
assumes that it has found the line size.

This algorithm
works because for line sizes less than the true line size,
at least two line cache lines fit in the space of a
true cache line. Since that cache line will be accessed
twice, the first access will cause an expensive cache miss,
while the second access will be a cache hit. Once the
line cache line is equal to the true cache line size,
then all accesses will cause cache misses.

BUGS

line is
an experimental benchmark, but it seems to work well on most
systems.
