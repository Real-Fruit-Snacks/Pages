NAME
       Dpkg::Changelog - base class to implement a changelog parser

DESCRIPTION
       Dpkg::Changelog is a class representing a changelog file as an array of
       changelog entries (Dpkg::Changelog::Entry).  By deriving this class and
       implementing its parse method, you add the ability to fill this object
       with changelog entries.

METHODS
       $c = Dpkg::Changelog->new(%options)
           Creates a new changelog object.

       $c->set_options(%opts)
           Change the value of some options. "verbose" (defaults to 1) defines
           whether parse errors are displayed as warnings by default.
           "reportfile" is a string to use instead of the name of the file
           parsed, in particular in error messages. "range" defines the range
           of entries that we want to parse, the parser will stop as soon as
           it has parsed enough data to satisfy $c->get_range($opts{range}).

       $count = $c->parse($fh, $description)
           Read the filehandle and parse a changelog in it. The data in the
           object is reset before parsing new data.

           Returns the number of changelog entries that have been parsed with
           success.

           This method needs to be implemented by one of the specialized
           changelog format subclasses.

       $count = $c->load($filename)
           Parse $filename contents for a changelog.

           Returns the number of changelog entries that have been parsed with
           success.

       $c->reset_parse_errors()
           Can be used to delete all information about errors occurred during
           previous parse runs.

       $c->parse_error($file, $line_nr, $error, [$line])
           Record a new parse error in $file at line $line_nr. The error
           message is specified with $error and a copy of the line can be
           recorded in $line.

       $c->get_parse_errors()
           Returns all error messages from the last parse run.  If called in
           scalar context returns a human readable string representation. If
           called in list context returns an array of arrays. Each of these
           arrays contains

           1.  a string describing the origin of the data (a filename
               usually). If the reportfile configuration option was given, its
               value will be used instead.

           2.  the line number where the error occurred

           3.  an error description

           4.  the original line

       $c->set_unparsed_tail($tail)
           Add a string representing unparsed lines after the changelog
           entries.  Use undef as $tail to remove the unparsed lines currently
           set.

       $c->get_unparsed_tail()
           Return a string representing the unparsed lines after the changelog
           entries. Returns undef if there's no such thing.

       @{$c}
           Returns all the Dpkg::Changelog::Entry objects contained in this
           changelog in the order in which they have been parsed.

       $c->get_range($range)
           Returns an array (if called in list context) or a reference to an
           array of Dpkg::Changelog::Entry objects which each represent one
           entry of the changelog. $range is a hash reference describing the
           range of entries to return. See section "RANGE SELECTION".

       $c->abort_early()
           Returns true if enough data have been parsed to be able to return
           all entries selected by the range set at creation (or with
           set_options).

       $str = $c->output()
       "$c"
           Returns a string representation of the changelog (it's a
           concatenation of the string representation of the individual
           changelog entries).

       $c->output($fh)
           Output the changelog to the given filehandle.

       $c->save($filename)
           Save the changelog in the given file.

       $control = $c->format_range($format, $range)
           Formats the changelog into Dpkg::Control::Changelog objects
           representing the entries selected by the optional range specifier
           (see "RANGE SELECTION" for details). In scalar context returns a
           Dpkg::Index object containing the selected entries, in list context
           returns an array of Dpkg::Control::Changelog objects.

           With format dpkg the returned Dpkg::Control::Changelog object is
           coalesced from the entries in the changelog that are part of the
           range requested, with the fields described below, but considering
           that "selected entry" means the first entry of the selected range.

           With format rfc822 each returned Dpkg::Control::Changelog objects
           represents one entry in the changelog that is part of the range
           requested, with the fields described below, but considering that
           "selected entry" means for each entry.

           The different formats return undef if no entries are matched. The
           following fields are contained in the object(s) returned:

           Source
               package name (selected entry)

           Version
               packages' version (selected entry)

           Distribution
               target distribution (selected entry)

           Urgency
               urgency (highest of all entries in range)

           Maintainer
               person that created the (selected) entry

           Date
               date of the (selected) entry

           Timestamp
               date of the (selected) entry as a timestamp in seconds since
               the epoch

           Closes
               bugs closed by the (selected) entry/entries, sorted by bug
               number

           Changes
               content of the (selected) entry/entries

RANGE SELECTION
       A range selection is described by a hash reference where the allowed
       keys and values are described below.

       The following options take a version number as value.

       since
           Causes changelog information from all versions strictly later than
           version to be used.

       until
           Causes changelog information from all versions strictly earlier
           than version to be used.

       from
           Similar to "since" but also includes the information for the
           specified version itself.

       to  Similar to "until" but also includes the information for the
           specified version itself.

       The following options don't take version numbers as values:

       all If set to a true value, all entries of the changelog are returned,
           this overrides all other options.

       count
           Expects a signed integer as value. Returns "value" entries from the
           top of the changelog if set to a positive integer, and "abs(value)"
           entries from the tail if set to a negative integer.

       offset
           Expects a signed integer as value. Changes the starting point for
           "count", either counted from the top (positive integer) or from the
           tail (negative integer). "offset" has no effect if "count" wasn't
           given as well.

       Some examples for the above options. Imagine an example changelog with
       entries for the versions 1.2, 1.3, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0 and 3.1.

         Range                        Included entries
         -----                        ----------------
         since => '2.0'               3.1, 3.0, 2.2
         until => '2.0'               1.3, 1.2
         from  => '2.0'               3.1, 3.0, 2.2, 2.1, 2.0
         to    => '2.0'               2.0, 1.3, 1.2
         count =>  2                  3.1, 3.0
         count => -2                  1.3, 1.2
         count =>  3, offset => 2     2.2, 2.1, 2.0
         count =>  2, offset => -3    2.0, 1.3
         count => -2, offset => 3     3.0, 2.2
         count => -2, offset => -3    2.2, 2.1

       Any combination of one option of "since" and "from" and one of "until"
       and "to" returns the intersection of the two results with only one of
       the options specified.
