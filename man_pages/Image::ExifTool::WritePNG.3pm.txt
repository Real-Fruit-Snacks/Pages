NAME
       Image::ExifTool::WritePNG.pl - Write PNG meta information

SYNOPSIS
       These routines are autoloaded by Image::ExifTool::PNG.

DESCRIPTION
       This file contains routines to write PNG metadata.

NOTES
       Compress::Zlib is required to write compressed text.

       Existing text tags are always rewritten in their original form
       (compressed zTXt, uncompressed tEXt or international iTXt), so pre-
       existing compressed information can only be modified if Compress::Zlib
       is available.

       Newly created textual information is written in uncompressed tEXt form
       by default, or as compressed zTXt if the Compress option is used and
       Compress::Zlib is available (but only if the resulting compressed data
       is smaller than the original text, which isn't always the case for
       short text strings).
