NAME

zcat -
decompress and concatenate files to standard output

SYNOPSIS

zcat
[options] [files]

DESCRIPTION

zcat copies
each file argument to standard output in sequence. If any
file given is compressed, its decompressed content is
copied. If a file given does not exist, and its name does
not end with one of the known extensions, zcat tries the
compressed file names corresponding to the formats supported
until one is found. If a file fails to decompress, zcat
continues copying the rest of the files.

If a file is
specified as ’-’, data are read from standard
input, decompressed if needed, and sent to standard output.
Data read from standard input must be of the same type; all
uncompressed or all in the same compressed format.

If no files are
specified, recursive searches examine the current working
directory, and nonrecursive searches read standard
input.

The formats
supported are bzip2, gzip, lzip, xz, and zstd.

Exit status is
0 if no errors occurred, 1 otherwise.
