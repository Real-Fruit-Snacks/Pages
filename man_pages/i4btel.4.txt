I4BTEL(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual I4BTEL(4)

NAME

i4btel &mdash; isdn4bsd
ISDN B-channel telephony interface driver

SYNOPSIS

device
"i4btel" [count]

DESCRIPTION

The i4btel driver
provides an interface to the ISDN B-channel for telephony
applications and is currently used by the isdnd(8) for
answering machine support. The driver is part of the
isdn4bsd package.

The lower six
bits of the drivers&rsquo;s minor number is used to specify
a unit number, whereas the upper two bits specify a
functionality.

Functionality
zero is the usual telephony data stream i/o driver.

Functionality
one is used to enable commands to dial out and hang up and
receive responses about the state of the dial out progress
and status. This commands may change in the future, for
details see the file i4b_tel_ioctl.h and the
isdnphone(8) utility.

The telephony
data stream comes out of the line in a bit-reversed format,
so the i4btel driver does the bit-reversion process
in any case.

Additionally,
the user can specify to do A-law to u-law, u-law to A-law or
no conversion at all in the i4btel driver by using the
isdntelctl(8) utility.

The driver is
able to process several ioctl&rsquo;s:

I4B_TEL_GETAUDIOFMT

get currently used audio format
conversion.

I4B_TEL_SETAUDIOFMT

set currently used audio format
conversion.

I4B_TEL_EMPTYINPUTQUEUE

clear the input queue.

For the
I4B_TEL_GETAUDIOFMT and I4B_TEL_SETAUDIOFMT, the following
parameters are available:

CVT_NONE

do no A-law/u-law audio format
conversion. The conversion path looks like this:

USER 
bitreversing  ISDN-line

CVT_ALAW2ULAW

set set audio format conversion
to do an audio conversion from A-law (on the ISDN line) to
u-law (in the userland). The read(2) conversion path looks
like this:

USER 

and the
write(2) conversion path looks like this:

USER -->
u-law/A-law --> bitreversing --> ISDN-line

CVT_ULAW2ALAW

set set audio format conversion
to do an audio conversion from u-law (on the ISDN line) to
A-law (in the userland). The read(2) conversion path looks
like this:

USER 

and the
write(2) conversion path looks like this:

USER -->
A-law/u-law --> bitreversing --> ISDN-line
