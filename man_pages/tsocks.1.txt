NAME

tsocks -
Shell wrapper to simplify the use of the tsocks(8) library
to transparently allow an application to use a SOCKS
proxy

SYNOPSIS

tsocks
[application [application’s arguments]] 
or tsocks [-on|-off] 
or tsocks

DESCRIPTION

tsocks
is a wrapper between the tsocks library and the application
what you would like to run socksified.

OPTIONS

[application [application’s arguments]]

run the application as
specified with the environment (LD_PRELOAD) set such that
tsocks(8) will transparently proxy SOCKS connections in that
program

[-on|-off]

this option adds or removes
tsocks(8) from the LD_PRELOAD environment variable. When
tsocks(8) is in this variable all executed applications are
automatically socksified. If you want to use this function,
you HAVE to source the shell script from yours, like this:
"source /usr/bin/tsocks" or ".
/usr/bin/tsocks" 
Example: 
". tsocks -on" -- add the tsocks lib to LD_PRELOAD
(don’t forget the leading dot!) 
". tsocks -off" -- remove the tsocks lib from
LD_PRELOAD (don’t forget the leading dot!)

[-show|-sh]

show the current value of the
LD_PRELOAD variable

create a new shell with
LD_PRELOAD including tsocks(8).
