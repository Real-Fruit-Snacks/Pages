NAME

sq pki link add
- Link a certificate and a User ID

SYNOPSIS

sq pki link
add [OPTIONS] FINGERPRINT|KEYID
USERID|EMAIL

DESCRIPTION

Link a
certificate and a User ID.

This cause
&rsquo;sq&rsquo; to considers the certificate and User ID
binding to be authentic.

A certificate
can also be accepted as a certification authority, which is
also known as a trusted introducer, by using the
&rsquo;--ca&rsquo; or &rsquo;--depth&rsquo; option.

A link can be
retracted using &rsquo;sq pki link retract&rsquo;.

This command is
similar to &rsquo;sq pki certify&rsquo;, but the
certifications it makes are done using the certificate
directory&rsquo;s trust root, not an arbitrary key. Further,
the certificates are marked as non-exportable. The former
makes it easier to manage certifications, especially when
the user&rsquo;s certification key is offline. And the
latter improves the user&rsquo;s privacy, by reducing the
chance that parts of the user&rsquo;s social graph is leaked
when a certificate is shared.

By default a
link never expires. Using the &rsquo;--expiry&rsquo;
argument specific validity periods may be defined. It allows
for providing a point in time for validity to end or a
validity duration.

&rsquo;sq pki
link&rsquo; respects the reference time set by the top-level
&rsquo;--time&rsquo; argument. It sets the link&rsquo;s
creation time to the reference time.

OPTIONS

Subcommand
options 
-a, --amount=AMOUNT

Set the amount of trust. Values
between 1 and 120 are meaningful. 120 means fully trusted.
Values less than 120 indicate the degree of trust. 60 is
usually used for partially trusted.

--all

Link all valid self-signed User ID to the
certificate. 

--ca=*|DOMAIN

Mark the certificate as a
certification authority for a domain. Use &rsquo;*&rsquo; to
make the certificate a certification 
authority for any User ID.

A certification
authority is also referred to as a trusted introducer. This
command is equivalent to making the trust depth
unconstrained, i.e., setting the depth to 255. See
&rsquo;--depth&rsquo; for more information.

-d,
--depth=TRUST_DEPTH

Set the trust depth (sometimes
referred to as the trust level). 0 means a normal
certification of . 1 means
CERTIFICATE is also a trusted introducer, 2 means
CERTIFICATE is a meta-trusted introducer, etc.

--email=EMAIL

An email address to link to the
certificate. The email address must match the email address
of a self-signed User ID. To link an email address to the
certificate that does not appear in a self-signed User ID,
use &rsquo;--petname&rsquo;. If the specified email appears
in multiple self-signed User IDs, then all of them are
linked.

--expiry=EXPIRY

Define EXPIRY for the
acceptance as ISO 8601 formatted string or custom duration.
If an ISO 8601 formatted string is provided, the validity
period reaches from the reference time (may be set using
&rsquo;--time&rsquo;) to the provided time. Custom durations
starting from the reference time may be set using
&rsquo;N[ymwds]&rsquo;, for N years, months, weeks, days, or
seconds. The special keyword &rsquo;never&rsquo; sets an
unlimited expiry.

--notation NAME
VALUE

Add a notation to the
certification. A user-defined notation&rsquo;s name must be
of the form &rsquo;name [AT] a.org&rsquo;. If
the notation&rsquo;s name starts with a &rsquo;!&rsquo;,
then the notation is marked as being critical. If a consumer
of a signature doesn&rsquo;t understand a critical notation,
then it will ignore the signature. The notation is marked as
being human readable.

--petname=PETNAME

A User ID to link to the
certificate. Unlike &rsquo;--userid&rsquo;, this does not
need to match a self-signed User ID. Bare email address are
automatically wrapped in angle brackets. That is if
&rsquo;alice [AT] example.org&rsquo; is provided, it is silently
converted to &rsquo;alice [AT] example.org>&rsquo;.

-r,
--regex=REGEX

Add a regular expression to
constrain what a trusted introducer can certify. The regular
expression must match the certified User ID in all
intermediate introducers, and the certified certificate.
Multiple regular expressions may be specified. In that case,
at least one must match.

--temporary

Temporarily accepts the
binding. Creates a fully 
trust link between a certificate and one or more 
User IDs for a week. After that, the link is 
automatically downgraded to a partially trusted link 
(trust = 40).

--userid=USERID

A User ID to link to the
certificate. This must match a self-signed User ID. To link
a User ID to the certificate that does not have a
self-signature, use &rsquo;--petname&rsquo;.

FINGERPRINT|KEYID

The certificate to accept.

USERID|EMAIL

A User ID or email address to
link to the certificate. This must match a self-signed User
ID. To link a User ID to the certificate that does not have
a self-signature, use &rsquo;--petname&rsquo;. Scripts
should prefer to use &rsquo;--email&rsquo; or
&rsquo;--userid&rsquo;, as &rsquo;sq&rsquo; does not need to
guess if a value is a User ID or an email address.

EXAMPLES

The user links
0123456789ABCDEF and the User ID
&rsquo;romeo [AT] example.org>&rsquo;.

sq pki link add
0123456789ABCDEF &rsquo;romeo [AT] example.org>&rsquo;

The user
examines 0123456789ABCDEF and then accepts the certificate
0123456789ABCDEF with its current set of self-signed User
IDs.

sq cert export
--cert 0123456789ABCDEF | sq inspect

...

sq pki link add
0123456789ABCDEF --all

The user links
the certificate and its current self-signed User IDs for a
week.

sq pki link add
--expires-in 1w 0123456789ABCDEF --all

The user
accepts the certificate, and its current self-signed User
IDs as a certification authority. That is, the certificate
is considered a trust root.

sq pki link add
--ca &rsquo;*&rsquo; 0123456789ABCDEF --all

The user
accepts the certificate and its current self-signed User IDs
as a partially trusted certification authority.

sq pki link add
--ca &rsquo;*&rsquo; --amount 60 0123456789ABCDEF --all

The user
retracts their acceptance of 0123456789ABCDEF and any
associated User IDs. This effectively invalidates any
links.

sq pki link
retract 0123456789ABCDEF
