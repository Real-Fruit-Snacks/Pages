LDIV(3POSIX)               POSIX Programmer's Manual              LDIV(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       ldiv, lldiv — compute quotient and remainder of a long division

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdlib.h>

       ldiv_t ldiv(long numer, long denom);
       lldiv_t lldiv(long long numer, long long denom);

DESCRIPTION
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with  the
       ISO C  standard.  Any  conflict between the requirements described here
       and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017
       defers to the ISO C standard.

       These  functions  shall compute the quotient and remainder of the divi‐
       sion of the numerator numer by the denominator denom.  If the  division
       is  inexact, the resulting quotient is the long integer (for the ldiv()
       function) or long long integer (for the  lldiv()  function)  of  lesser
       magnitude  that is the nearest to the algebraic quotient. If the result
       cannot be represented, the behavior is undefined; otherwise, quot * de‐
       nom+rem shall equal numer.

RETURN VALUE
       The ldiv() function shall return a structure of type ldiv_t, comprising
       both the quotient and the remainder. The structure  shall  include  the
       following members, in any order:

           long   quot;    /* Quotient */
           long   rem;     /* Remainder */

       The lldiv() function shall return a structure of type lldiv_t, compris‐
       ing both the quotient and the remainder. The  structure  shall  include
       the following members, in any order:

           long long   quot;    /* Quotient */
           long long   rem;     /* Remainder */
