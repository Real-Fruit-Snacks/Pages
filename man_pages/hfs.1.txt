NAME

hfs - shell for
manipulating HFS volumes

SYNOPSIS

hfs
[hfs-path [partition-no]]

DESCRIPTION

hfs is
an interactive command-oriented tool for manipulating HFS
volumes. hfs is based on the Tcl interpreter, so
basic Tcl constructs can be used in addition to the
following commands: 
mount path [partition-no]

The specified UNIX path is
opened as an HFS volume. If a partition number n is
specified and the volume source is located on a partitioned
medium, the nth discovered HFS partition will be
mounted. The default partition-no is 1.

umount [path]

The volume previously mounted
from the specified path (or the current volume, if none
specified) is unmounted.

vol path

The volume previously mounted
from the specified path is made current.

info

General information about the currently mounted volume
is displayed. This information is also displayed
automatically when the volume is mounted.

pwd

The full path to the current working HFS directory is
displayed. 

cd [hfs-path]

The current working directory
is changed to the given HFS path. If no path is given, the
working directory is changed to the root of the volume.

dir [hfs-path]

A directory listing of the
specified HFS directory is displayed. If no path is given,
the contents of the current working directory are shown.

mkdir hfs-path

A new, empty directory is
created with the specified path.

rmdir hfs-path

The specified directory is
removed. It must be empty.

create hfs-path [type
[creator]]

An empty file is created with
the specified path. The Macintosh type and creator may be
specified, or they will default to TEXT and
UNIX, respectively.

del hfs-path

Both forks of the specified
file are deleted.

stat hfs-path

Status information about the
specified HFS path-identified entity is displayed.

cat hfs-path

The data fork of the specified
HFS file is displayed.

copyin unix-path
[hfs-path [mode]]

The specified UNIX file is
copied to the named HFS destination path. Unless specified
otherwise, the file will be copied into the current HFS
working directory using a heuristically chosen mode. The
mode may be one of: macb (MacBinary II),
binh (BinHex), text, or raw.

copyout hfs-path
[unix-path [mode]]

The specified HFS file is
copied into the named UNIX destination path. Unless
specified otherwise, the file will be copied into the
current UNIX working directory using a heuristically chosen
mode. The modes are the same as for copyin.

format path
[partition-no [volume-name]]

The specified UNIX path is
initialized as an empty HFS volume with the given name, and
this volume is subsequently mounted. The default volume name
is Untitled.

The shell is
scriptable, however it should be understood that the above
commands are actually implemented by Tcl procedures prefixed
with the character "h", e.g. hmount, hcd, etc., in
order to avoid name collisions with other Tcl utilities. The
"h" may be omitted in interactive use for
convenience.

BUGS

cat can
only display the data fork of a file. Text translations are
performed unconditionally on the output. Furthermore, binary
data cannot be handled properly from within Tcl scripts
since the character with value 0 cannot be represented in
Tcl strings. Use copyout to copy files without these
limitations.
