TIP(1) BSD General Commands Manual TIP(1)

NAME

tip, cu &mdash;
connect to a remote system

SYNOPSIS

tip [&minus;nv]
[&minus;speed] [system-name] 
cu [&minus;ehot]
[&minus;a acu]
[&minus;l line]
[&minus;s speed] [&minus;#]
[phone-number]

DESCRIPTION

The tip and cu
utilities establish a full-duplex connection to another
machine, giving the appearance of being logged in directly
on the remote CPU. It goes without saying that you must have
a login on the machine (or equivalent) to which you wish to
connect. The preferred interface is tip. The
cu interface is included for those people attached to
the &rsquo;&rsquo;call UNIX&rsquo;&rsquo; command of
Version 7 AT&T UNIX. This manual page describes
only tip.

The options are
as follows:

&minus;a acu

Set the
acu.

&minus;l line

For cu,
specify the line to use. Either of the forms like
tty00 or /dev/tty00 are permitted.

&minus;n

No escape
(disable tilde).

&minus;s speed

For cu,
set the speed of the connection. Defaults to 9600.

&minus;v

Set verbose
mode.

If speed
is specified it will override any baudrate specified in the
system description being used.

If neither
speed nor system-name are specified,
system-name will be set to the value of the HOST
environment variable.

If speed
is specified but system-name is not,
system-name will be set to a value of
&rsquo;&rsquo;tip&rsquo;&rsquo; with speed appended.
E.g., tip &minus;1200 will set system-name to
&rsquo;&rsquo;tip1200&rsquo;&rsquo;.

Typed characters
are normally transmitted directly to the remote machine
(which does the echoing as well). A tilde (&rsquo;~&rsquo;)
appearing as the first character of a line is an escape
signal; the following are recognized:

~^D or ~.

Drop the connection and exit
(you may still be logged in on the remote machine).

~c [name]

Change directory to name
(no argument implies change to your home directory).

~!

Escape to a
shell (exiting the shell will return you to tip).

~>

Copy file from
local to remote. The tip utility prompts for the name
of a local file to transmit.

~

Copy file from
remote to local. The tip utility prompts first for
the name of the file to be sent, then for a command to be
executed on the remote machine.

~p from
[to]

Send a file to a remote UNIX
host. The put command causes the remote UNIX system to run
the command string &rsquo;&rsquo;cat >
to&rsquo;&rsquo;, while tip sends it the
from file. If the to file is not specified,
the from file name is used. this command is actually
a UNIX specific version of the ~> command.

~t from
[to]

Take a file from a remote UNIX
host. As in the put command, the to file defaults to
the from file name if it is not specified. The remote
host executes the command string &rsquo;&rsquo;cat
from; echo ^A&rsquo;&rsquo; to send the file
to tip.

~|

Pipe the output
from a remote command to a local UNIX process. The command
string sent to the local UNIX system is processed by the
shell.

~$

Pipe the output
from a local UNIX process to the remote host. The command
string sent to the local UNIX system is processed by the
shell.

~C

Fork a child
process on the local system to perform special protocols
such as XMODEM. The child program will be run with the
following somewhat unusual arrangement of file
descriptors:

0 
local tty in 
1  local tty out 
2  local tty out 
3  remote tty in 
4  remote tty out

~#

Send a BREAK to
the remote system. For systems which do not support the
necessary ioctl() call the break is simulated by a
sequence of line speed changes and DEL characters.

~s

Set a variable
(see the discussion below).

~v

List all
variables and their values (if set).

~^Z

Stop tip
(only available with job control).

~^Y

Stop only the
&rsquo;&rsquo;local side&rsquo;&rsquo; of tip (only
available with job control); the &rsquo;&rsquo;remote
side&rsquo;&rsquo; of tip, the side that displays
output from the remote host, is left running.

~?

Get a summary
of the tilde escapes.

To find the
system description and thus the operating characteristics of
system-name, tip searches for a system
description with a name identical to system-name. The
search order is as follows:

1.

If the environment variable
REMOTE does not start with a &rsquo;/&rsquo; it is assumed
to be a system description, and is considered first.

2.

If the environment variable
REMOTE begins with a &rsquo;/&rsquo; it is assumed to be a
path to a remote(5) database, and the specified database is
searched.

3.

The default remote(5) database,
/etc/remote, is searched.

See remote(5)
for full documentation on system descriptions.

The br
capability is used in system descriptions to specify the
baud rate with which to establish a connection. If the value
specified is not suitable, the baud rate to be used may be
given on the command line, e.g., &rsquo;&rsquo;tip -300
mds&rsquo;&rsquo;.

When tip
establishes a connection, it sends out the connection
message specified in the cm capability of the system
description being used.

When tip
prompts for an argument (e.g., during setup of a file
transfer), the line typed may be edited with the standard
erase and kill characters. A null line in response to a
prompt, or an interrupt, will abort the dialogue and return
you to the remote machine.

The tip
utility guards against multiple users connecting to a remote
system by opening modems and terminal lines with exclusive
access, and by honoring the locking protocol used by
uucico(8).

During file
transfers, tip provides a running count of the number
of lines transferred. When using the ~> and
~ commands, the eofread and
eofwrite variables are used to recognize end-of-file
when reading, and specify end-of-file when writing (see
below). File transfers normally depend on tandem mode for
flow control. If the remote system does not support tandem
mode, echocheck may be set to indicate that
tip should synchronize with the remote system on the
echo of each transmitted character.

When tip
must dial a phone number to connect to a system, it will
print various messages indicating its actions. The
tip utility supports a variety of auto-call units and
modems with the at capability in system
descriptions.

Support for
Ventel 212+ (ventel), Hayes AT-style (hayes), USRobotics
Courier (courier), Telebit T3000 (t3000) and Racal-Vadic 831
(vadic) units is enabled by default.

Support for
Bizcomp 1031[fw] (biz31[fw]), Bizcomp 1022[fw] (biz22[fw]),
DEC DF0[23]-AC (df0[23]), DEC DN-11 (dn11) and Racal-Vadic
3451 (v3451) units can be added by recompiling tip
with the appropriate defines.

Note that if
support for both the Racal-Vadic 831 and 3451 is enabled,
they are referred to as the v831 and v3451, respectively. If
only one of the two is supported, it is referred to as
vadic.

Variables

The tip utility maintains a set of variables which
control its operation. Some of these variables are read-only
to normal users (root is allowed to change anything of
interest). Variables may be displayed and set through the
~s escape. The syntax for variables is patterned
after vi(1) and Mail(1). Supplying
&rsquo;&rsquo;all&rsquo;&rsquo; as an argument to the set
command displays all variables readable by the user.
Alternatively, the user may request display of a particular
variable by attaching a &rsquo;?&rsquo; to the end. For
example, &rsquo;&rsquo;escape?&rsquo;&rsquo; displays the
current escape character.

Variables are
numeric, string, character, or boolean values. Boolean
variables are set merely by specifying their name; they may
be reset by prepending a &rsquo;!&rsquo; to the name. Other
variable types are set by concatenating an &rsquo;=&rsquo;
and the value. The entire assignment must not have any
blanks in it. A single set command may be used to
interrogate as well as set a number of variables. Variables
may be initialized at run time by placing set commands
(without the ~s prefix in a file .tiprc in
one&rsquo;s home directory). The &minus;v option
causes tip to display the sets as they are made.
Certain common variables have abbreviations. The following
is a list of common variables, their abbreviations, and
their default values:

beautify

(bool) Discard
unprintable characters when a session is being scripted;
abbreviated be.

baudrate

(num) The baud rate at
which the connection was established; abbreviated
ba.

dialtimeout

(num) When dialing a
phone number, the time (in seconds) to wait for a connection
to be established; abbreviated dial.

echocheck

(bool) Synchronize with
the remote host during file transfer by waiting for the echo
of the last character transmitted; default is
off.

eofread

(str) The set of
characters which signify an end-of-transmission during a
~ file transfer command; abbreviated
eofr.

eofwrite

(str) The string sent to
indicate end-of-transmission during a ~> file
transfer command; abbreviated eofw.

eol

(str)
The set of characters which indicate an end-of-line. The
tip utility will recognize escape characters only
after an end-of-line.

escape

(char)
The command prefix (escape) character; abbreviated
es; default value is &rsquo;~&rsquo;.

exceptions

(str) The set of
characters which should not be discarded due to the
beautification switch; abbreviated ex; default value
is &rsquo;&rsquo;\t\n\f\b&rsquo;&rsquo;.

force

(char)
The character used to force literal data transmission;
abbreviated fo; default value is
&rsquo;^P&rsquo;.

framesize

(num) The amount of data
(in bytes) to buffer between file system writes when
receiving files; abbreviated fr.

host

(str)
The name of the host to which you are connected; abbreviated
ho.

prompt

(char)
The character which indicates an end-of-line on the remote
host; abbreviated pr; default value is
&rsquo;\n&rsquo;. This value is used to synchronize during
data transfers. The count of lines transferred during a file
transfer command is based on receipt of this character.

raise

(bool)
Upper case mapping mode; abbreviated ra; default
value is off. When this mode is enabled, all
lowercase letters will be mapped to uppercase by tip
for transmission to the remote machine.

raisechar

(char) The input
character used to toggle uppercase mapping mode; abbreviated
rc; default value is &rsquo;^A&rsquo;.

record

(str)
The name of the file in which a session script is recorded;
abbreviated rec; default value is
tip.record.

script

(bool)
Session scripting mode; abbreviated sc; default is
off. When script is true, tip
will record everything transmitted by the remote machine in
the script record file specified in record. If the
beautify switch is on, only printable ASCII
characters will be included in the script file (those
characters between 040 and 0177). The variable
exceptions is used to indicate characters which are
an exception to the normal beautification rules.

tabexpand

(bool) Expand tabs to
spaces during file transfers; abbreviated tab;
default value is false. Each tab is expanded to 8
spaces.

verbose

(bool) Verbose mode;
abbreviated verb; default is true. When
verbose mode is enabled, tip prints messages while
dialing, shows the current number of lines transferred
during a file transfer operations, and more.

shell to use for the ~! command; default value is
/bin/sh.

HOME
