SYNOPSIS

#include

int
drand48_r(struct drand48_data *buffer, double
*result);

int
erand48_r(unsigned short xsubi[3],

struct drand48_data *buffer, double
*result);

int
lrand48_r(struct drand48_data *buffer, long
*result);

int
nrand48_r(unsigned short xsubi[3], 
struct drand48_data *buffer, long
*result);

int
mrand48_r(struct drand48_data *buffer,long
*result);

int
jrand48_r(unsigned short xsubi[3], 
struct drand48_data *buffer, long
*result);

int
srand48_r(long int seedval, struct
drand48_data *buffer);

int
seed48_r(unsigned short seed16v[3], 
struct drand48_data *buffer);

int

struct drand48_data *buffer);

Feature Test
Macro Requirements for glibc (see
feature_test_macros(7)):

All functions
shown above: 
/* Glibc since 2.19: */ _DEFAULT_SOURCE 
|| /* Glibc versions 

DESCRIPTION

These functions
are the reentrant analogs of the functions described in
drand48(3). Instead of modifying the global random
generator state, they use the supplied data
buffer.

Before the
first use, this struct must be initialized, for example, by
filling it with zeros, or by calling one of the functions
srand48_r(), seed48_r(), or
lcong48_r().

RETURN VALUE

The return
value is 0.

ATTRIBUTES

For an
explanation of the terms used in this section, see
attributes(7).

CONFORMING TO

These functions
are GNU extensions and are not portable.
