C SYNOPSIS

#include

int
pmWhichZone(char **tz);

DESCRIPTION

The current
reporting timezone effects the timezone used by
pmCtime(3) and pmLocaltime(3).

pmWhichZone
returns the handle of the current timezone, as previously
established by a call to pmNewZone(3) or
pmNewContextZone(3). If the call is successful (i.e.
there exists a current reporting timezone) then a
non-negative integer is returned and tz is set to
point to a static buffer containing the timezone string
itself.

DIAGNOSTICS

A return value
less than zero indicates there is no current reporting
timezone.
