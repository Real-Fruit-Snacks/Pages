NAME
       pamlevels - effect a 'levels' transformation

SYNOPSIS
       pamlevels  -from1  from1  -to1  to1 -from2 from2 -to2 to2 [-from3 from3
       -to3 to3] [-linear] [-fitbrightness] [pamfile]

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       pamlevels reads a Netpbm image from pamfile or standard input,  applies
       a  'levels' transformation, and sends the result to standard output. It
       finds a unique transformation that maps color from1 to to1, color from2
       to  to2, and-if -from3 and -to3 are supplied-color from3 to to3. Trans-
       formations based on two mappings are  linear  in  light  intensity  and
       those based on three mappings quadratic.  The color-mapping options may
       be shortened to -f1...-f3 and -t1...-t3.

       Color values have the following format: color[:scale], where color is a
        Netpbm color specification <libppm.html#colorname>  and scale  an  op-
       tional coefficient that is applied to the intensity (i.e. not gamma-ad-
       justed) of each RGB component of color.

       When the transformation is linear (i.e. uses  two  mappings)  and  pre-
       serves  zero  (i.e. maps black to black), it corresponds to multiplica-
       tion of light intensity by a constant and preserves color integrity(1).

EXAMPLES
       In the examples below, \ denotes a line continuation:

       To brighten an image by setting a darker white point-
           pamlevels -f1 black -t1 black \
             -f2 white:0.9 -t2 white in.ppm > out.ppm

       To adjust the white point-
           pamlevels -f1 black -t1 black \
             -f2 rgbi:0.9/0.83/0.80 -t2 white in.ppm > out.ppm

       To set a lighter black point-
           pamlevels -f1 white:0.06 -t1 black \
             -f2 white -t2 white in.ppm > out.ppm

       To increase brightness by compression-
           pamlevels \
             -f1 black -t1 black -f2 white -t2 white \
             -f3 white:0.5 -t3 white:0.6 in.ppm > out.ppm

       The latter tranformation is similar to gamma-correction.

OPTIONS
       In addition to the options common to all programs  based  on  libnetpbm
       (most notably -quiet, see
        Common  Options <index.html#commonoptions> ), pamlevels recognizes the
       following command line options:

       -from1

       -to1

       -from2

       -to2

       -from3

       -to3   These options define the mappings of input colors to output col-
              ors  that  anchor  the transformation function.  See DESCRIPTION
              <#description> .

              You must specify at least two of these pairs.

       -linear
              This option tells pamlevels to work  with  the  intensity-linear
              variation on PPM where the samples are proportional to light in-
              tensity, rather than brightness (gamma-adjusted) as in true PPM.
              The  input must be of this form and the pamlevels makes the out-
              put of this form.

              Note  that  the  numbers   in   a   color   specification   like
              rgbi:0.9/0.83/0.80  are  brightness  levels (gamma-adjusted) re-
              gardless of the input and output format.

              You cannot use this with -fitbrightness because that function is
              not implemented.

       -fitbrightness
              This  option selects a transformation which is not very useful -
              it is linear or quadratic in brightness rather than light inten-
              sity  of  the  pixels.   There is no physical basis for doing it
              this way and the result is normally undesirable.

              Note that many tools other than  Netpbm  do  the  transformation
              this  way.  One use for this option is simply to demonstrate the
              poor result of this method.

              One advantage of this transformation is that it is  faster,  be-
              cause  the input and output image formats use brightness values.
              The result is approximately correct.

              You cannot use this with -linear because that  function  is  not
              implemented.
