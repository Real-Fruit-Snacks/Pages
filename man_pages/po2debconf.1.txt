NAME

po2debconf
&minus; merge master templates file and PO files

SYNOPSIS

po2debconf
[&minus;v] [&minus;h]
[&minus;&minus;podir=
DIR ] [&minus;o
FILE ] [&minus;e
STRING ] master

DESCRIPTION

This program
reads all PO files and a single
templates file, and produces a Debconf templates file
containing all translations, similar to the one produced by
debconf&minus;mergetemplate(1) (from the
"debconf&minus;utils" package).
PO files are by default searched in the
po subdirectory below the location of the master
file.

To help the
language code transition for Norwegian Bokm&aring;l, the
no and nb language codes are handled
specially. If no.po exists, it should be renamed to
nb.po. Using nb.po will make both
"&minus;no" and
"&minus;nb" translations available in the
templates file.

Lines beginning
with a number sign ("#") are comments in
templates files. They are useful to give hints to
translators, and are discarded by po2debconf. Special
comments have been introduced in
"po&minus;debconf" 1.0. They are in the
form "#flag:directive".
The "#flag:partial" is the only directive
interpreted by po2debconf. Normally when a field is
composed of several paragraphs (like
"__Choices" and
"_Description"), it is translated if all
paragraphs are translated. When a field contains
"#flag:partial", translated strings may
be mixed with untranslated strings.

OPTIONS

&minus;h,
&minus;&minus;help

Display a usage summary and
exit.

&minus;v,
&minus;&minus;verbose

Process in verbose mode.

&minus;&minus;podir=
DIR

Set directory for
PO files. Default is to search
PO files in the po subdirectory below
the location of the master file.

&minus;o,
&minus;&minus;output=
FILE

Set output filename (default is
standard output).

&minus;e,
&minus;&minus;encoding=
STRING

Convert encoding. Argument can
take 3 values: "utf8" (convert to
UTF&minus;8 ), "po" (do
not change encoding) and "popular"
(convert encoding of input files depending on their
language; the "PODEBCONF_ENCODINGS"
environment variable must point to a name of a file
containing the encoding map).

Such a filename
looks like:

  #
  #   Number is comment sign
  #
  cs       ISO&minus;8859&minus;2
  da       ISO&minus;8859&minus;1
  de       ISO&minus;8859&minus;1
  el       ISO&minus;8859&minus;7

etc.

Default
encoding used to be "popular", and has
been switched to "utf8" since po-debconf
0.9.0.

OUTPUT FORMAT

Since debconf
1.2.0, templates format has changed, encoding is part of
field names, i.e. they are
"foo&minus;lang.encoding".
When older debconf encounter such fields, they are silently
ignored, which means that original text is displayed.

If present, a
po/output file can override defaults for encoding and
output format. It contains a single line with two fields.
The first field is the output format (currently valid values
are 1 for fields in the form
"foo&minus;lang", and 2
for
"foo&minus;lang.encoding")
and the second field is the encoding, e.g.

   echo '2 utf8' > po/output

let
po2debconf convert text to
UTF&minus;8.

When encoding
is set to "po" or
"utf8", output format is always set to 2,
so that older debconf do not try to display text with wrong
encodings.
