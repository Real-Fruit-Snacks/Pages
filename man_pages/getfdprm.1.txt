getfdprm -
print the current format information

Note

This manpage
has been automatically generated from fdutils&rsquo;s
texinfo documentation. However, this process is only
approximative, and some items, such as cross-references,
footnotes and indices are lost in this translation process.
Indeed, these items have no appropriate representation in
the manpage format. Moreover, only the items specific to
each command have been translated, and the general
information about fdutils has been dropped in the manpage
version. Thus I strongly advise you to use the original
texinfo doc.

*   

To generate a printable copy from the texinfo doc, run
the following commands:

./configure;
make dvi; dvips fdutils.dvi

*   

To generate a HTML copy,
run: 

./configure;
make html

A pre-made HTML
can be found at:
&rsquo;http://www.tux.org/pub/knaff/fdutils&rsquo;

*   

To generate an info copy
(browsable using emacs&rsquo; info mode), run:

./configure;
make info

The texinfo doc
looks most pretty when printed or as HTML. Indeed, in the
info version certain examples are difficult to read due to
the quoting conventions used in info.
