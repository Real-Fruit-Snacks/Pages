NAME
       zuluMount-cli  -  command  line  tool  that manages encrypted and unen‐
       crypted volumes

DESCRIPTION
       zuluMount-cli is a tool that has a primary mission of opening and clos‐
       ing  encrypted  volumes  as  well as mounting and unmounting unecrypted
       volumes and opened encrypted ones.Its primary purpose  is  to  do  what
       tools like udisks does.

USAGE
       usage: see examples below

       options:
       -m  --  mount  a  volume  : arguments: -d volume_path -z mount_point -e
       mode(rw/ro)
             --             additional              arguments              for
       crypto_LUKS,crypto_PLAIN,crypto_TCRYPT  volumes,  -p passphrase/-f key‐
       file
       -z -- mount point component to append to "/run/media/private/$USER/"
       -u -- unmount a volume: arguments: -d volume_path
       -s -- print properties of  an  encrypted  volume:  arguments:  -d  vol‐
       ume_path
       -o  --  offset  in sectors on where the volume starts in the volume.The
       volume is assumed to be plain type with this option
             and the option must be given when -u or  -s  arguments  are  used
       with a volume opened with this option
       -M  --  this  option  will  create  a  mount  point in "/run/media/pri‐
       vate/$USER/" and a publicly accessible "mirror" in "/run/media/public/'
       -l -- print expanded list of all volumes
       -Y -- file system options
       -e -- mount options
       -t -- volume type to assume when unlocking a volume.Use "vera" when un‐
       locking a VeraCrypt volume.
       -L  -- must be used with -d,print properties of a volume specified by d
       option
       -P -- print a list of all volumes
       -A -- print a list of all volumes
       -S -- print a list of system volumes
       -N -- print a list of non system volumes
       -E -- print a list of mounted volumes
       -D -- get a device node address from its mapper path( mapper paths  are
       usually located in /dev/mapper ). Required argument: -d
       -F  --  path  to  truecrypt multiple keyfiles.Keyfiles are separated by
       "\011" character sequence
       examples:
       mount a volume  : zuluMount-cli -m -d /dev/sdc1
       unmount a volume: zuluMount-cli -u -d /dev/sdc1
       mount an encrypted volume with  a  key  "xyz"  :  zuluMount-cli  -m  -d
       /dev/sdc2 -p xyz
