NAME

mkimapdcert -
create a test SSL certificate for IMAP over SSL

SYNOPSIS

/usr/sbin/mkimapdcert 

DESCRIPTION

IMAP over SSL
requires a valid, signed, X.509 certificate. The default
location for the certificate file is /etc/courier/imapd.pem.
mkimapdcert generates a self-signed X.509
certificate, mainly for testing. For production use the
X.509 certificate must be signed by a recognized certificate
authority, in order for mail clients to accept the
certificate.

/etc/courier/imapd.pem
must be owned by the courier user and have no group or world
permissions. The mkimapdcert command will enforce
this. To prevent an unfortunate accident, mkimapdcert
will not work if /etc/courier/imapd.pem already
exists.

mkimapdcert
requires OpenSSL to be installed.

FILES

/etc/courier/imapd.pem

X.509 certificate.

/etc/courier/imapd.cnf

Parameters used by OpenSSL to
create the X.509 certificate.
