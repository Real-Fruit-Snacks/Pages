NAME

pmLocaltime
- convert the date and time for a reporting timezone

C SYNOPSIS

#include

#include 

struct tm
*pmLocaltime(const time_t *clock, struct tm
*result);

cc ...
-lpcp

DESCRIPTION

pmLocaltime
is very similar to localtime(3), except the timezone
used is the current &rsquo;&rsquo;reporting
timezone&rsquo;&rsquo; (rather than the default TZ
environment variable scheme), and the result is returned
into a caller-declared buffer (rather than a private
buffer).

Like
localtime(3) the time to be converted is passed via
clock, and the result contains the components
broken out in the elements of the tm struct.

pmLocaltime
returns result as the value of the function.

The default
current reporting timezone is as defined by the TZ
environment variable, so pmLocaltime and
localtime(3) will initially produce a similar
encoding of the date and time.

Use
pmNewZone(3), pmNewContextZone(3) or
pmUseZone(3) to establish a new current reporting
timezone that will affect pmLocaltime but not
localtime(3).
