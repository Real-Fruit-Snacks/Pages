NAME

pmnsmerge
- merge multiple versions of a Performance Co-Pilot PMNS

SYNOPSIS

$PCP_BINADM_DIR/pmnsmerge
[-adfxv] infile [...] outfile

DESCRIPTION

pmnsmerge
merges multiple instances of a Performance Metrics Name
Space (PMNS), as used by the components of the Performance
Co-Pilot (PCP).

Each
infile argument names a file that includes the root
of a PMNS, of the form

root { 
/* arbitrary stuff */ 
}

The order in
which the infile files are processed is determined by
the presence or absence of embedded control lines of the
form

#define
_DATESTAMP YYYYMMDD

Files without a
control line are processed first and in the order they
appear on the command line. The other files are then
processed in order of ascending _DATESTAMP.

The -a
option suppresses the argument re-ordering and processes all
files in the order they appear on the command line.

The merging
proceeds by matching names in PMNS, only those new
names in each PMNS are considered, and these are added after
any existing metrics with the longest possible matching
prefix in their names. For example, merging these two input
PMNS

root { root {

surprise 1:1:3 
mine 1:1:1 mine 1:1:1 
foo foo 
yawn 
yours 1:1:2 
} } 
foo { foo { 
fumble 1:2:1 
mumble 1:2:3 
stumble 1:2:2 stumble 1:2:2 
} } 
yawn { 
sleepy 1:3:1 
}

Produces the
resulting PMNS in out.

root { 
mine 1:1:1 
foo 
yours 1:1:2 
surprise 1:1:3 
yawn 
} 
foo { 
fumble 1:2:1 
stumble 1:2:2 
mumble 1:2:3 
} 
yawn { 
sleepy 1:3:1 
}

To avoid
accidental over-writing of PMNS files, outfile is
expected to not exist when pmnsmerge starts. The
-f option allows an existing outfile to be
unlinked (if possible) and truncated before writing
starts.

Normally
duplicate names for the same Performance Metric Identifier
(PMID) in a PMNS are allowed. The -d option is the
default option and is included for backwards compatibility.
The -x option reverses the default and
pmnsmerge will report an error and exit with a
non-zero status if a duplicate name is found for a PMID in
any of the input PMNS files or in the merged
output PMNS.

The -v
option produces one line of diagnostic output as each
infile is processed.

Once all of the
merging has been completed, pmnsmerge will attempt to
load the resultant namespace using
pmLoadASCIINameSpace(3) - if this fails for any
reason, outfile will still be created, but
pmnsmerge will report the problem and exit with
non-zero status.

Using
pmnsmerge with a single input argument allows
that PMNS file to be checked. In addition to syntactic
checking, specifying -x will also enable a check for
duplicate names for all PMIDs.

OPTIONS

The available
command line options are:

-a

Process files in command line order.

-d, --dupok

Allow duplicate metric names
per PMID. This is the default.

-f, --force

Overwrite output file if it
already exists.

-v, --verbose

Verbose input processing.

-x, --nodups

Do not allow duplicate metric
names per PMID.

-?, --help

Display usage message and
exit.

CAVEATS

Once the
writing of the new outfile file has begun, the
signals SIGINT, SIGHUP and SIGTERM will be ignored to
protect the integrity of the new file.

PCP ENVIRONMENT

Environment
variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On
each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains
the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).
