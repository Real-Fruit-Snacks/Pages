NAME

curl_formfree -
free a previously build multipart/formdata HTTP POST
chain

SYNOPSIS

#include

void
curl_formfree(struct curl_httppost *form);

DESCRIPTION

This function
is deprecated. Do not use! See curl_mime_init(3)
instead!

curl_formfree()
is used to clean up data previously built/appended with
curl_formadd(3). This must be called when the data
has been used, which typically means after
curl_easy_perform(3) has been called.

The pointer to
free is the same pointer you passed to the
CURLOPT_HTTPPOST(3) option, which is the
firstitem pointer from the curl_formadd(3)
invoke(s).

form is
the pointer as returned from a previous call to
curl_formadd(3) and may be NULL.

Passing in a
NULL pointer in form will make this function return
immediately with no action.

AVAILABILITY

Deprecated in
7.56.0.

RETURN VALUE

None
