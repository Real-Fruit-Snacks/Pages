NAME

xawtvrc -- TV
apps config file

SYNOPSIS

/etc/X11/xawtvrc

$HOME/.xawtv

DESCRIPTION

xawtvrc
is the config file originally used by xawtv only
(that&rsquo;s why the name xawtvrc). These days a number of
other TV applications / utilities read it too to get
configuration information from it.

Both a global
(/etc/X11/xawtvrc) and personal ($HOME/.xawtv) config file
are used by the applications. Settings in the personal
config file will overwrite the global ones.

Applications

The following applications use these config files:

xawtv

The classic X11 TV application.

motv

A better, motif-based GUI for xawtv ...

fbtv

TV application for the linux framebuffer console.

ttv

aalib-based TV application for any terminal.

v4lctl

command line tool to control video4linux devices.

Create a
config file 
xawtv and motv both provide some functions to
edit the channels and save the configuration. The save
function will not preserve any comments you might
have put into the config file through ...

You can also
use your favorite text editor and modify the config file
directly.

You can use the
command line utility scantv to create a initial
config file. scantv will automatically scan all channels for
TV stations and write the ones it has found to the config
file.

SYNTAX

xawtvrc
uses the same syntax like smb.conf: sections starting with
[name], followed by lines with option = value pairs.

There are four
special sections: [global], [launch], [eventmap] and
[defaults]. All other sections describe a TV station
each.

TV station
options. 
The following options are allowed for TV stations and the
[defaults] section. The options from the [defaults] sections
are used -- as the name suggests -- as defaults for all
other channels. You can put everything which is common for
all TV stations (like the TV norm which is used in your
country) into the [defaults] section, so you don&rsquo;t
have to specify it for every single channel.

With a
reasonable [defaults] section you usually only need to
specify the channel for each TV station, like this:

[ORB] 
channel = 27

The other
options are: 
fine = n

finetuning (what left+right
keys do within xawtv), default: 0

norm = pal | ntsc |
secam

which TV norm, default is
pal

key = keysym

Hotkey for the channel. All X11
keysyms allowed here. You can prefix a keysym with
Modifier+, "Ctrl+F" for example.

capture = off | overlay |
grabdisplay

capture mode: off, overlay
(default, TV card => video, 0% cpu) or grabdisplay (TV
card => main memory => X-Server => video, frame
rate depends on load and picture size). Default is overlay.
If it is not possible to use overlay for some reason (remote
display, not supported by the hardware, whatever) the
applications will automatically fallback to grabdisplay.

input = Television |
Composite1 | Composite2 | SVHS

input source. The valid choices
depend on the hardware driver, the values above are just
examples. You can use "v4lctl list" to get a list
of valid choices.

color = n 
bright = n 
hue = n 
contrast = n

Valid range is 0-65535, default
is 32768. Adding a percent symbol changes the range to
0-100, i.e. "50%" has the same effect like
"32768".

audio = mono | stereo |
lang1 | lang2

Set the audio mode for the
given channel.

freq = n

Specify the frequency for the
given station (MHz, video carrier). You shouldn&rsquo;t need
this for normal operation, all your channels should be
listed in the frequency table for your area (if not, mail me
a patch). Maybe unless you live near the border and the
foreign country uses another channel scheme.

midi = note

Use midi noteon event for
 as hotkey for the channel.

group = name

Put the channel into the group
. motv uses that to create submenus per channel
group.

Global
options 
A number of not channel-related settings go to the
"[global]" section: 
fullscreen = width x height

specify which video mode should
be used for full-screen. Works with XFree only, and of
course you need a valid modeline for this mode in your
XF86Config file. You also have to enable the VidMode
extension (option -vm, see above) to make this work.

wm-off-by =
[+-]x[+-]y

Some WM&rsquo;s handle static
gravity incorrectly (I know mwm and kwm). This is somewhat
boring with fullscreen mode. With this option you can
correct this with a displacement for moving windows. For
example, wm-off-by = -4-24 does the trick for kwm (the KDE1
window manager).

freqtab =

select a channel-to-frueqency
mapping. Options window->Frequency table (in xawtv)
brings up a menu with all valid entries (and allows
table-switching at runtime).

pixsize = width x
height

size of the channel pixmaps
(within Channels window). 0x0 disables this feature.

pixcols = n

number of columns the channel
window should use. Defaults to 1.

mixer = ctl |
device:ctl

This allows volume control
using the sound card mixer. ctl is the mixer control, i.e.
"vol" for the master volume. "line1" is
a good candidate for the TV card. device is the mixer device
(defaults to /dev/mixer in unspecified). Volume-control
works with the keypad: + is up, - is down, Enter is
mute.

jpeg-quality = n

set the quality for (M)JPEG
images/frames. As usual the valid range for n is [0 .. 100]
with 75 as default.

keypad-ntsc = on |
off

Configure keypad mode. Default
is off. When set to on, numbers typed on the keypad are
interpreted as channel numbers (this is like NTSC TV sets
work). Otherwise they are interpreted as programmed station,
i.e. 1 is the first station from $HOME/.xawtv, ...

keypad-partial = on |
off

Another configuration of keypad
mode. Default is on. When set to off, typing one digit on
the keypad doesn&rsquo;t change the station number when
there are two-digit station numbers starting with that
digit.

osd = on | off

Enable/disable the onscreen
display in fullscreen mode. Default is on.

osd-position = x , y

Position the onscreen display,
in pixels. Default is 30,20.

use-wm-fullscreen = on |
off

Enter fullscreen mode by asking
the window manager to handle that via
_NET_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN (if supported by the wm). Default
is on.

ratio = x:y

Set a fixed aspect ratio for
the TV image. Default is 4:3. Use 0:0 if you don&rsquo;t
want a fixed aspect ratio.

mov-driver = files | raw |
avi | mov 
mov-video = ppm | pgm | jpeg | rgb | gray | 422 | 422p |
rgb15 | rgb24 
| mjpeg | jpeg | raw | mjpa | png 
mov-fps = fps 
mov-audio = mono8 | mono16 | stereo 
mov-rate = rate

Set defaults for movie
recording. Not all possible combinations are valid choices.
"streamer -h" will print a nice list.

midi = port

You can specify a ALSA port
where xawtv should receive midi events from. If configured
this way, you can program your midi keyboard keys as station
hotkeys and use midi controller events to control settings
like volume, bright etc. Check the [eventmap] description
below for details.

filter = name

Enable the specified
filter.

alsa_latency =
time_in_ms

This can be used to specify the
latency for the ALSA digital sound loopback which xawtv
does. The default is 30ms if you&rsquo;re getting sound
dropouts on your system try increasing this setting.

The [launch]
section 
You can start other programs from within xawtv. This is
configured with entries in the "[launch]" section:

label = key, command line

The specified hotkey will run
the configured program. Calling the Action
"Launch(label)" works too. If you want to play
with the Xt translation tables, feel free to do so. But
don&rsquo;t complain if you broke something while doing
so...

The
[eventmap] section 
The eventmap simply has a number of "event =
action" lines. "action" can be any command
which xawtv understands (check the xawtv-remote man page for
a list). "event" is some event generated by any
input device xawtv listens to. An event might have some
argument, the midi-ctrl events for example have one. If
present the argument is appended to the action.

There are
default mappings for lirc and joystick input events, so you
don&rsquo;t have to create an eventmap to use them. But if
you don&rsquo;t like the defaults you can change them
easily.

Here is a list
of valid events: 
lirc-key-

The key  was
pressed on the IR remote control.

joy-button-

Joystick button  was
pressed.

joy-axis-

Joystick was moved into the
given direction.

midi-note-

noteon event for note 
was received (i.e. you probably pressed some key on the midi
keyboard).

midi-ctrl-

midi controller message for
control  was received. This event has an argument
(the current value of the control).

kbd-key-

Key  was pressed on
the keyboard.
