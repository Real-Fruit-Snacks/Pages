NAME

crypt — storage
format for hashed passphrases and available hashing
methods

DESCRIPTION

The hashing methods implemented
by crypt(3) are designed only to process user passphrases
for storage and authentication; they are not suitable for
use as general-purpose cryptographic hashes.

Passphrase
hashing is not a replacement for strong passphrases. It is
always possible for an attacker with access to the hashed
passphrases to guess and check possible cleartext
passphrases. However, with a strong hashing method, guessing
will be too slow for the attacker to discover a strong
passphrase.

All of the
hashing methods use a “salt” to perturb the hash
function, so that the same passphrase may produce many
possible hashes. Newer methods accept longer salt strings.
The salt should be chosen at random for each user. Salt
defeats a number of attacks:

1.

It is not possible to hash a
passphrase once and then test it against each
account’s stored hash; the hash calculation must be
repeated for each account.

2.

It is not possible to tell
whether two accounts use the same passphrase without
successfully guessing one of the phrases.

3.

Tables of precalculated hashes
of commonly used passphrases must have an entry for each
possible salt, which makes them impractically large.

All of the
hashing methods are also deliberately engineered to be slow;
they use many iterations of an underlying cryptographic
primitive to increase the cost of each guess. The newer
hashing methods allow the number of iterations to be
adjusted, using the “CPU time cost” parameter to
crypt_gensalt(3). This makes it possible to keep the hash
slow as hardware improves.

FORMAT OF HASHED
PASSPHRASES

All of the hashing methods
supported by crypt(3) produce a hashed passphrase which
consists of four components: prefix, options,
salt, and hash. The prefix controls which
hashing method is to be used, and is the appropriate string
to pass to crypt_gensalt(3) to select that method. The
contents of options, salt, and hash are
up to the method. Depending on the method, the prefix
and options components may be empty.

The
setting argument to crypt(3) must begin with the
first three components of a valid hashed passphrase, but
anything after that is ignored. This makes authentication
simple: hash the input passphrase using the stored
passphrase as the setting, and then compare the result to
the stored passphrase.

Hashed
passphrases are always entirely printable ASCII, and do not
contain any whitespace or the characters ’:’,
’;’, ’*’, ’!’, or
’\’. (These characters are used as delimiters
and special markers in the passwd(5) and shadow(5)
files.)

The syntax of
each component of a hashed passphrase is up to the hashing
method. ’$’ characters usually delimit
components, and the salt and hash are usually encoded as
numerals in base 64. The details of this base-64 encoding
vary among hashing methods. The common “base64”
encoding specified by RFC 4648 is usually not
used.

AVAILABLE HASHING
METHODS

This is a list of all the
hashing methods supported by crypt(3), in decreasing order
of strength. Many of the older methods are now considered
too weak to use for new passphrases. The hashed passphrase
format is expressed with extended regular expressions (see
regex(7)) and does not show the division into prefix,
options, salt, and hash.

yescrypt

yescrypt is a scalable passphrase hashing scheme designed by
Solar Designer, which is based on Colin Percival’s
scrypt. Recommended for new hashes.

Prefix

"$y$"

Hashed passphrase
format

\$y\$[./A-Za-z0-9]+\$[./A-Za-z0-9]{,86}\$[./A-Za-z0-9]{43}

Maximum passphrase
length

unlimited

Hash size

256 bits

Salt size

up to 512 (128+ recommended)
bits

CPU time cost
parameter

1 to 11 (logarithmic)

gost-yescrypt

gost-yescrypt uses the output from the yescrypt hashing
method in place of a hmac message. Thus, the yescrypt crypto
properties are superseded by the GOST R 34.11-2012
(Streebog) hash function with a 256 bit digest. This hashing
method is useful in applications that need modern passphrase
hashing methods, but require to rely on the cryptographic
properties of GOST algorithms. The GOST R 34.11-2012
(Streebog) hash function has been published by the IETF as
RFC 6986. Recommended for new hashes.

Prefix

"$gy$"

Hashed passphrase
format

\$gy\$[./A-Za-z0-9]+\$[./A-Za-z0-9]{,86}\$[./A-Za-z0-9]{43}

Maximum passphrase
length

unlimited

Hash size

256 bits

Salt size

up to 512 (128+ recommended)
bits

CPU time cost
parameter

1 to 11 (logarithmic)

scrypt

scrypt is a password-based key derivation function created
by Colin Percival, originally for the Tarsnap online backup
service. The algorithm was specifically designed to make it
costly to perform large-scale custom hardware attacks by
requiring large amounts of memory. In 2016, the scrypt
algorithm was published by IETF as RFC 7914.

Prefix

"$7$"

Hashed passphrase
format

\$7\$[./A-Za-z0-9]{11,97}\$[./A-Za-z0-9]{43}

Maximum passphrase
length

unlimited

Hash size

256 bits

Salt size

up to 512 (128+ recommended)
bits

CPU time cost
parameter

6 to 11 (logarithmic)

bcrypt

A hash based on the Blowfish block cipher, modified to have
an extra-expensive key schedule. Originally developed by
Niels Provos and David Mazieres for OpenBSD and also
supported on recent versions of FreeBSD and NetBSD, on
Solaris 10 and newer, and on several GNU/*/Linux
distributions.

Prefix

"$2b$"

Hashed passphrase

184 bits

Salt size

128 bits

CPU time cost
parameter

4 to 31 (logarithmic)

The alternative
prefix "$2y$" is equivalent to "$2b$".
It exists for historical reasons only. The alternative
prefixes "$2a$" and "$2x$" provide
bug-compatibility with crypt_blowfish 1.0.4 and earlier,
which incorrectly processed characters with the 8th bit
set.

sha512crypt

A hash based on SHA-2 with 512-bit output, originally
developed by Ulrich Drepper for GNU libc. Supported on Linux
but not common elsewhere. Acceptable for new hashes. The
default CPU time cost parameter is 5000, which is too low
for modern hardware.

Prefix

"$6$"

Hashed passphrase
format

\$6\$(rounds=[1-9][0-9]+\$)?[^$:\n]{1,16}\$[./0-9A-Za-z]{86}

Maximum passphrase

6 to 96 bits

CPU time cost
parameter

1000 to 999,999,999

sha256crypt

A hash based on SHA-2 with 256-bit output, originally
developed by Ulrich Drepper for GNU libc. Supported on Linux
but not common elsewhere. Acceptable for new hashes. The
default CPU time cost parameter is 5000, which is too low
for modern hardware.

Prefix

1000 to 999,999,999

sha1crypt

A hash based on HMAC-SHA1. Originally developed by Simon
Gerraty for NetBSD. Not as weak as the DES-based hashes
below, but SHA1 is so cheap on modern hardware that it
should not be used for new hashes.

Prefix

"$sha1"

Hashed passphrase
format

\$sha1\$[1-9][0-9]+\$[./0-9A-Za-z]{1,64}\$[./0-9A-Za-z]{8,64}[./0-9A-Za-z]{32}

unlimited

Hash size

160 bits

Salt size

6 to 384 bits

CPU time cost
parameter

4 to 4,294,967,295

SunMD5

A hash based on the MD5 algorithm, with additional
cleverness to make precomputation difficult, originally
developed by Alec David Muffet for Solaris. Not adopted
elsewhere, to our knowledge. Not as weak as the DES-based
hashes below, but MD5 is so cheap on modern hardware that it
should not be used for new hashes.

Prefix

"$md5"

Hashed passphrase
format

\$md5(,rounds=[1-9][0-9]+)?\$[./0-9A-Za-z]{8}\${1,2}[./0-9A-Za-z]{22}

4096 to 4,294,963,199

md5crypt

A hash based on the MD5 algorithm, originally developed by
Poul-Henning Kamp for FreeBSD. Supported on most free Unixes
and newer versions of Solaris. Not as weak as the DES-based
hashes below, but MD5 is so cheap on modern hardware that it
should not be used for new hashes. CPU time cost is not
adjustable.

Prefix

"$1$"

Hashed passphrase
format

\$1\$[^$:\n]{1,8}\$[./0-9A-Za-z]{22}

Maximum passphrase
length

unlimited

Hash size

128 bits

Salt size

6 to 48 bits

CPU time cost
parameter

1000

bsdicrypt
(BSDI extended DES) 
A weak extension of traditional DES, which eliminates the
length limit, increases the salt size, and makes the time
cost tunable. It originates with BSDI and is also available
on at least NetBSD, OpenBSD, and FreeBSD due to the use of
David Burren’s FreeSec library. It is better than
bigcrypt and traditional DES, but still should not be used
for new hashes.

Prefix

"_"

Hashed passphrase
format

_[./0-9A-Za-z]{19}

Maximum passphrase
length

unlimited (ignores 8th bit)

Hash size

64 bits

Effective key size

56 bits

Salt size

24 bits

CPU time cost
parameter

1 to 16,777,215 (must be
odd)

bigcrypt

A weak extension of traditional DES, available on some
System V-derived Unixes. All it does is raise the length
limit from 8 to 128 characters, and it does this in a crude
way that allows attackers to guess chunks of a long
passphrase in parallel. It should not be used for new
hashes.

Prefix

"" (empty string)

Hashed passphrase
format

[./0-9A-Za-z]{13,178}

Maximum passphrase
length

128 characters (ignores 8th
bit)

Hash size

up to 1024 bits

Effective key size

up to 896 bits

Salt size

12 bits

CPU time cost
parameter

25

descrypt
(Traditional DES) 
The original hashing method from Unix V7, based on the DES
block cipher. Because DES is cheap on modern hardware,
because there are only 4096 possible salts and 2**56
possible hashes, and because it truncates passphrases to 8
characters, it is feasible to discover any passphrase
hashed with this method. It should only be used if you
absolutely have to generate hashes that will work on an old
operating system that supports nothing else.

Prefix

"" (empty string)

Hashed passphrase
format

[./0-9A-Za-z]{13}

Maximum passphrase
length

8 characters (ignores 8th
bit)

64 bits

Effective key size

56 bits

Salt size

12 bits

CPU time cost
parameter

25

NT 
The hashing method used for network authentication in some
versions of the SMB/CIFS protocol. Available, for
cross-compatibility’s sake, on FreeBSD. Based on MD4.
Has no salt or tunable cost parameter. Like traditional DES,
it is so weak that any passphrase hashed with this
method is guessable. It should only be used if you
absolutely have to generate hashes that will work on an old
operating system that supports nothing else.

Prefix

"$3$"

Hashed passphrase
format

\$3\$\$[0-9a-f]{32}

Maximum passphrase
length

unlimited

Hash size

256 bits

Salt size

0 bits
