NAME
       XML::LibXML::Comment - XML::LibXML Comment Class

SYNOPSIS
         use XML::LibXML;
         # Only methods specific to Comment nodes are listed here,
         # see the XML::LibXML::Node manpage for other methods

         $node = XML::LibXML::Comment->new( $content );

DESCRIPTION
       This class provides all functions of XML::LibXML::Text, but for comment
       nodes. This can be done, since only the output of the node types is
       different, but not the data structure. :-)

METHODS
       The class inherits from XML::LibXML::Node. The documentation for
       Inherited methods is not listed here.

       Many functions listed here are extensively documented in the DOM Level
       3 specification (<http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Core/>). Please
       refer to the specification for extensive documentation.

       new
             $node = XML::LibXML::Comment->new( $content );

           The constructor is the only provided function for this package. It
           is required, because libxml2 treats text nodes and comment nodes
           slightly differently.
