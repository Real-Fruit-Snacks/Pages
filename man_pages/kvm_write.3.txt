KVM_READ(3) BSD Library Functions Manual KVM_READ(3)

NAME

kvm_read,
kvm_write â€” read or write kernel virtual
memory

SYNOPSIS

#include

ssize_t

kvm_read(kvm_t *kd,
u_long addr, void *buf,
size_t nbytes);

ssize_t

kvm_write(kvm_t *kd,
u_long addr, const void *buf,
size_t nbytes);

DESCRIPTION

The kvm_read() and
kvm_write() functions are used to read and write
kernel virtual memory (or a crash dump file). See
kvm_open(3) or kvm_openfiles(3)
for information regarding opening kernel virtual memory and
crash dumps.

The
kvm_read() function transfers nbytes bytes of
data from the kernel space address addr to
buf. Conversely, kvm_write() transfers data
from buf to addr. Unlike their SunOS
counterparts, these functions cannot be used to read or
write process address spaces.

RETURN VALUES

Upon success, the number of
bytes actually transferred is returned. Otherwise, -1 is
returned.
