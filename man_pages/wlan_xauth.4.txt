WLAN_XAUTH(4)

NAME

wlan_xauth &mdash;
External authenticator support for 802.11 devices

SYNOPSIS

device wlan_xauth

DESCRIPTION

The wlan_xauth module is
a wlan(4) authenticator plugin for use with user-mode
authentication implementations such as hostapd. It
hooks into the 802.11 layer and does nothing. As a result,
802.11 stations that associate are not authorized to send or
receive frames until they are authorized by an external
agent; typically using a protocol such as WPA, 802.1x, or
802.11i.

This module is
automatically loaded by the rc script that normally starts
hostapd(8).
