NAME
       security_set_boolean,    security_commit_booleans,   security_get_bool-
       ean_names, security_get_boolean_active, security_get_boolean_pending  -
       routines for manipulating SELinux boolean values

SYNOPSIS
       #include <selinux/selinux.h>

       int security_get_boolean_names(char ***names, int *len);

       int security_get_boolean_pending(const char *name);

       int security_get_boolean_active(const char *name);

       int security_set_boolean(const char *name, int value);

       int security_set_boolean_list(size_t boolcnt, SELboolean *boollist, int
       permanent);

       int security_commit_booleans(void);

DESCRIPTION
       The SELinux policy can include conditional rules that  are  enabled  or
       disabled  based  on  the  current  values  of a set of policy booleans.
       These policy booleans allow runtime modification of the security policy
       without having to load a new policy.

       The  SELinux  API allows for a transaction based update. So you can set
       several boolean values and then commit them all at once.

       security_get_boolean_names() provides a list  of  boolean  names,  cur-
       rently supported by the loaded policy.

       security_get_boolean_pending() returns the pending value for boolean or
       -1 on failure.

       security_get_boolean_active() returns the active value for  boolean  or
       -1 on failure.

       security_set_boolean() sets the pending value for boolean

       security_set_boolean_list() saves a list of booleans in a single trans-
       action. Note that the int permanent flag is deprecated  and  should  be
       set to zero.

       security_commit_booleans() commits all pending values for the booleans.

RETURN VALUE
       Where not otherwise stated, functions described in this manual page re-
       turn zero on success or -1 on error.
