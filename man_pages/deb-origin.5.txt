NAME

deb-origin -
Vendor-specific information files

SYNOPSIS

%PKGCONFDIR%/origins/filename

DESCRIPTION

The files in
%PKGCONFDIR%/origins can provide information about
various vendors who are providing Debian packages.

They contain a
number of fields, or comments when the line starts with
&rsquo;#&rsquo;. Each field begins with a tag, such
as Vendor or Parent, followed by a colon and
the body of the field. Fields are delimited only by field
tags. In other words, field text may be multiple lines in
length, but the tools will join lines when processing the
body of the field.

The file should
be named according to the vendor name. The usual convention
is to name the vendor file using the vendor name in all
lowercase, but some variation is permitted. Namely, spaces
are mapped to dashes (&rsquo;-&rsquo;), and the file
can have the same casing as the value in Vendor
field, or it can be capitalized.
