NAME

pmLookupInDomText
- return text describing a performance metrics instance
domain

C SYNOPSIS

#include

int
pmLookupInDomText(pmInDom indom, int
level, char **buffer);

cc ...
-lpcp

DESCRIPTION

Retrieve
descriptive text about the performance metrics instance
domain identified by indom.

The value for
the instance domain indom is typically extracted from
a pmDesc structure, following a call to
pmLookupDesc(3) for a particular performance
metric.

The argument
level should be PM_TEXT_ONELINE for a one-line
summary, else PM_TEXT_HELP for a more verbose
description, suited to a help dialog.

The space
pointed to by buffer will have been allocated in
pmLookupInDomText with malloc(3), and it is
the responsibility of the caller to free(3) the space
when it is no longer required.

pmLookupInDomText
returns zero on success.

DIAGNOSTICS

PM_ERR_NOTHOST

For archives created with
versions of PCP prior to 4.0, if the current PMAPI context
is an archive (help and one-line text was previously not
maintained in the archives)
