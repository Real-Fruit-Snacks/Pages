DESCRIPTION

gbp pull
updates the debian, upstream and
pristine-tar branches from remote repositories in one
go. It checks if the update is safe (would result in a
fast-forward merge) and aborts otherwise.

If given on the
command line the changes are fetched from the given
repository otherwise the default for repository is
read from the remote configuration for each branch
(in git&rsquo;s configuration).

OPTIONS

--version

Print version of the program,
i.e. version of the git-buildpackage suite

-v, --verbose

Verbose execution

-h, --help

Print help and exit

--color=[auto|on|off]

Whether to use colored
output.

--color-scheme=COLOR_SCHEME

Colors to use in output (when
color is enabled). The format for COLOR_SCHEME is
&rsquo;:::&rsquo;.
Numerical values and color names are accepted, empty fields
imply the default color. For example,
--git-color-scheme=&rsquo;cyan:34::&rsquo; would show
debug messages in cyan, info messages in blue and other
messages in default (i.e. warning and error messages in
red).

--force

Force a branch update even if
this results in a non fast forward update. 
Warning

Forcing a
branch update makes you lose your modifications.

--all

Update all remote-tracking branches that have identical
name in the remote repository.

--redo-pq

Also rebuild the corresponding
patch-queue using gbp pq. 
Warning

This drops the
patch-queue branch if it exists.

--ignore-branch

Don&rsquo;t care if we&rsquo;re
on a branch or in detached head state.

--debian-branch=branch_name

The branch in the Git
repository the Debian package is being developed on, default
is master.

--upstream-branch=branch_name

The branch in the Git
repository the upstream sources are put onto. Default is
upstream.

--track-missing

If a branch is missing in the
local repository try to fetch it from the remote side and
(if it exists) fetch it and set up branch tracking for it.
This ensures that branches that are added at a later point
to the remote side (e.g. pristine-tar) are picked up
automatically. Note that it&rsquo;s not an error for the
branch to not exist on the remote side.

--depth=depth

Git history depth, for
deepening shallow git clones.

--pristine-tar

Whether to update the
pristine-tar branch too.

EXIT CODES

When
gbp pull finishes, it indicates success or
failure with its exit code:

0

Success.

1

An error occurred during the pull, see the printed error
message for details.

2

At least one branch couldn&rsquo;t be fast
forwarded. 

CONFIGURATION FILES

Several
gbp.conf files are parsed to set defaults for the
above command-line arguments. See the gbp.conf(5)
manpage for details.
