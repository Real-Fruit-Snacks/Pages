NAME

pqlist −
List available NetWare print queues

SYNOPSIS

pqlist [
-h ] [ -S server ] [ -U user
name ] [ -P password 
| -n ] [ -C ] [ pattern ]

DESCRIPTION

pqlist
lists all the NetWare print queues available to you on some
server. If you are already connected to some server, this
one is used.

If pqlist does
not print to a tty, the decorative header line is not
printed, so that you can count the printing queue available
on your server by doing

pqlist -S
server | wc -l

pqlist
looks up the file $HOME/.nwclient to find a file
server, a user name and possibly a password. See nwclient(5)
for more information. Please note that the access
permissions of .nwclient MUST be 600, for security
reasons.

OPTIONS

pattern

pattern is used to list
only selected queues. You can use wildcards in the pattern,
but you have to be careful to prevent shell interpretation
of wildcards like ’*’.

-h

-h is used to print out
a short help text.

-S
server

server is the name of
the server you want to use.

-U
user name

If the user name your NetWare
administrator gave to you differs from your unix user-id,
you should use -U to tell the server about your
NetWare user name.

-P
password

You may want to give the
password required by the server on the command line. You
should be careful about using passwords in scripts.

-n

-n should be given to
mount shares which do not require a password to log in.

If neither
-n nor -P are given, pqlist prompts for a
password.

-C

By default, passwords are
converted to uppercase before they are sent to the server,
because most servers require this. You can turn off this
conversion by -C.
