SYNOPSIS

cryptsetup
erase []  
cryptsetup luksErase []

DESCRIPTION

Erase all
keyslots and make the LUKS container permanently
inaccessible. Unless the device is configured with HW OPAL
support you do not need to provide any password for this
operation.

WARNING:
This operation is irreversible.

WARNING:
with --hw-opal-factory-reset ALL data is lost on the
device, regardless of the partition it is ran on, if any,
and regardless of any LUKS2 header backup, and does not
require a valid LUKS2 header to be present on the device to
run.

can be [--header, --disable-locks, --hw-opal-factory-reset,
--key-file].

OPTIONS

--batch-mode,
-q

Suppresses all confirmation
questions. Use with care!

If the
--verify-passphrase option is not specified, this option
also switches off the passphrase verification.

--debug or
--debug-json

Run in debug mode with full
diagnostic logs. Debug output lines are always prefixed by
#.

If --debug-json
is used, additional LUKS2 JSON data structures are
printed.

--disable-locks

Disable lock protection for
metadata on disk. This option is valid only for LUKS2 and
ignored for other formats.

WARNING:
Do not use this option unless you run cryptsetup in a
restricted environment where locking is impossible to
perform (where /run directory cannot be used).

--header

Use to specify detached LUKS2
header when erasing HW OPAL enabled data device.

--help,
-?

Show help text and default
parameters.

--hw-opal-factory-reset

Erase ALL data on the
OPAL self-encrypted device, regardless of the partition it
is ran on, if any, and does not require a valid LUKS2 header
to be present on the device to run. After providing correct
PSID via interactive prompt or via --key-file
parameter the device is erased.

--key-file,
-d name (LUKS2 with HW OPAL only)

Read the Admin PIN or PSID
(with --hw-opal-factory-reset) from file depending on
options used.

If the name
given is "-", then the secret will be read from
stdin. In this case, reading will not stop at newline
characters.

--usage

Show short option help.

--version,
-V

Show the program version.
