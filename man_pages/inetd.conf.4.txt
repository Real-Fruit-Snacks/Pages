NAME

inetd.conf
&minus; Internet servers database

SYNOPSIS

/etc/inet/inetd.conf

/etc/inetd.conf

DESCRIPTION

The
inetd.conf file contains the list of servers that
inetd(1M) invokes when it receives an Internet
request over a socket. Each server entry is composed of a
single line of the form:

service-name
endpoint-type protocol wait-status uid server-program \

server-arguments

Fields are
separated by either  or
 characters. A &rsquo;#&rsquo;
(number sign) indicates the beginning of a comment;
characters up to the end of the line are not interpreted by
routines that search this file. 
service-name

The name of a valid service
listed in the services file. For RPC services,
the value of the service-name field consists of the
RPC service name or program number, followed by a
&rsquo;/&rsquo; (slash) and either a version number
or a range of version numbers, for example,
rstatd/2-4.

endpoint-type

Can be one of: 
stream

for a stream socket

dgram

for a datagram socket

raw

for a raw socket

seqpacket

for a sequenced packet
socket

tli

for all TLI endpoints

protocol

A recognized protocol listed in
the file /etc/inet/protocols. For servers capable of
supporting TCP and UDP over IPv6, the
following protocol types are also recognized:

&bull;

tcp6

&bull;

udp6

tcp6 and udp6 are
not official protocols; accordingly, they are not listed in
the /etc/inet/protocols file.

Here the
inetd program uses an AF_INET6 type socket
endpoint. These servers can also handle incoming IPv4 client
requests in addition to IPv6 client requests.

For RPC
services, the field consists of the string rpc
followed by a &rsquo;/&rsquo; (slash) and either a
&rsquo;*&rsquo; (asterisk), one or more nettypes, one or
more netids, or a combination of nettypes and netids.
Whatever the value, it is first treated as a nettype. If it
is not a valid nettype, then it is treated as a netid. For
example, rpc/* for an RPC service using all
the transports supported by the system (the list can be
found in the /etc/netconfig file), equivalent to
saying rpc/visible rpc/ticots for an RPC
service using the Connection-Oriented Transport Service.

wait-status

This field has values
wait or nowait. This entry specifies whether
the server that is invoked by inetd will take over
the listening socket associated with the service, and
whether once launched, inetd will wait for
that server to exit, if ever, before it resumes listening
for new service requests. The wait-status for
datagram servers must be set to wait, as they are
always invoked with the orginal datagram socket that will
participate in delivering the service bound to the specified
service. They do not have separate "listening" and
"accepting" sockets. Accordingly, do not configure
UDP services as nowait. This causes a race
condition by which the inetd program selects on the
socket and the server program reads from the socket. Many
server programs will be forked, and performance will be
severely compromised. Connection-oriented services such as
TCP stream services can be designed to be either
wait or nowait status.

uid

The user ID under which the server should run.
This allows servers to run with access privileges other than
those for root.

server-program

Either the pathname of a server
program to be invoked by inetd to perform the
requested service, or the value internal if
inetd itself provides the service.

server-arguments

If a server must be invoked
with command line arguments, the entire command line
(including argument 0) must appear in this field (which
consists of all remaining words in the entry). If the server
expects inetd to pass it the address of its peer, for
compatibility with 4.2BSD executable daemons, then the first
argument to the command should be specified as %A. No
more than 20 arguments are allowed in this field. The
%A argument is implemented only for services whose
wait-status value is wait.
