DESCRIPTION

innreport
is a Perl script that summarizes INN log files, with
optional HTML output and graphs. It is normally invoked by
scanlogs(8) which includes the output of innreport in
daily Usenet reports.

Supported
programs are batcher, cnfsstat,
controlchan, innd, innfeed,
innxbatch, innxmit, nnrpd,
nntplink (an external program), overchan,
perl-nocem and rnews.

innreport
also updates the count of newsgroups not locally carried by
the news server, and for which articles have been received,
in the unwanted.log log file. If that update should
not be done, as it should occur only once a day while
parsing daily logs, the -notdaily flag should be
given to innreport.

If you want
innreport to generate graphs in its HTML reports, you
need the Perl graphic library GD.pm.

At least one
non-empty log file to parse should be given at the end of
the command line invoking innreport.

OPTIONS

Only one option
is mandatory: 
-f config-file

Full path to the configuration
file. It is usually innreport.conf in pathetc,
but there is no default value. This file lists the options
to use for the report. The options given in command line
when calling innreport take precedence over the ones
in the configuration file.

The other
options are optional. Prepending "no" in front of
boolean options permits unsetting them. For example, use
-nograph to remove the feature -graph enables.

-archive or -a

Sets whether HTML pages and
graphs should be archived if HTML reports are enabled. When
this option is set, which is the default, a date will be
added in the file name of each report and each graph.
Otherwise, only the latest HTML report is kept.

-casesensitive

Whether to do case sensitive
searches in news log files for predetermined patterns. This
option is enabled by default.

-config

Prints to standard output
configuration information for innreport, and
exits.

-cycle or -c
num-cycle

Sets how many report files
should be kept if HTML reports are enabled and archived. The
default is "0", meaning all archives are kept.

-dir or -d
http-dir

Sets the directory for web
pages if HTML reports are enabled. The default is the value
of pathhttp as set in inn.conf.

-graph or -g

If the Perl graphic library
GD.pm is installed and HTML reports are enabled,
graphs are also generated in PNG if supported by
"GD", which is the case in modern versions (GIF
will otherwise be generated). The default is to enable graph
generation.

-help or -h

Prints to standard output a
help message with all the options recognized by
innreport, and exits.

-html

Besides the plain text report
printed to standard output, innreport generates HTML
reports if this option is enabled. This option is disabled
by default (that is to say -nohtml is the
default).

-html-unknown

Whether to report unknown
entries from news log files in HTML reports, when enabled.
This option takes by default the same value as the one for
text plain reports (as set with the unknown
option).

-index or -i

Sets the name of the index web
page if HTML reports are enabled. The default is
"index.html".

-maxunrec
num-lines

How many unrecognized entries
from news log files to report, when the -unknown or
-html-unknown options are set. The default is
"50". Using "-1" means there is no
limit.

-notdaily

Whether to defer daily actions
for this run of innreport. Some actions should be
performed only once a day for a log file (notably
unwanted.log). This option is disabled by default,
meaning that all actions are always done, as we assume a
default setup of running scanlogs daily.

-path or -p
pictures-dir

Sets the directory for pictures
if HTML reports are enabled, and graphs are wanted. The
default is pathhttp/pics.

If both
-dir and -webpath are used, and -path
isn&rsquo;t, the directory used for pictures defaults to
http-dir as set with
-dir/pictures-path as set with
-webpath.

-separator or -s
char

Sets the separator between
hours, minutes and seconds in file names if HTML reports are
enabled and archived. The default is "." as
":" may not be properly read by all web browsers.
Be careful not to use "/" as a separator,
and to use only a valid file name character.

-unknown

Whether to report unknown
entries from news log files in plain text reports. This
option is enabled by default.

-v

Prints to standard output the version number of
innreport, and exits.

-webpath or -w
pictures-path

Sets the web path for pictures
in HTML pages if HTML reports are enabled, and graphs are
wanted. The default is "pics". It can be a
relative path or an absolute path. If an absolute path is
used, you have to set -path appropriately; otherwise
it will not be computed right.
