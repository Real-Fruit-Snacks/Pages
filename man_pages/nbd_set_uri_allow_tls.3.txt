nbd_set_uri_allow_tls
- set the allowed TLS settings in NBD URIs

SYNOPSIS

#include

int nbd_set_uri_allow_tls ( 
struct nbd_handle *h, int tls 
);

DESCRIPTION

Set which TLS
settings are allowed to appear in NBD URIs. The default is
to allow either non-TLS or TLS URIs.

The
"tls" parameter can be: 
"LIBNBD_TLS_DISABLE"

TLS URIs are not permitted, ie.
a URI such as "nbds://...&quot; will be rejected.

"LIBNBD_TLS_ALLOW"

This is the default. TLS may be
used or not, depending on whether the URI uses
"nbds" or "nbd".

"LIBNBD_TLS_REQUIRE"

TLS URIs are required. All URIs
must use "nbds".

RETURN VALUE

If the call is
successful the function returns 0.

ERRORS

On error -1 is
returned.

Refer to
"ERROR HANDLING" in libnbd(3) for how to

The following
parameters must not be NULL: "h". For more
