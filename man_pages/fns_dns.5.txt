overview of FNS over DNS implementation

DESCRIPTION

Federated
Naming Service (FNS) provides a method for federating
multiple naming services under a single, simple interface
for the basic naming operations. One of the naming services
supported by FNS is the Internet Domain Name System,
or DNS (see in.named(1M)). DNS is a
hierarchical collection of name servers that provide the
Internet community with host and domain name resolution.
FNS uses DNS to name entities globally. Names
can be constructed for any enterprise that is accessible on
the Internet; consequently, names can also be constructed
for objects exported by these enterprises.

FNS
provides the XFN interface for performing naming
resolution on DNS domains and hosts. In addition,
enterprise namespaces such as those served by NIS+
and NIS can be federated with DNS by adding
TXT records to DNS. To federate an NIS+
or NIS namespace under DNS, you first obtain
the root reference for the NIS+ hierarchy or
NIS domain. This reference is referred to as the
next naming system reference because it refers to the
next naming system beneath the DNS domain.
This reference contains information about how to communicate
with the NIS+ or NIS servers and has the
following format:

domainname>
server name> [ server
address> ]

where
domainname> is the fully qualified domain
name. Notice that NIS+ and NIS have slightly
different syntaxes for domain names. For NIS+, the
fully qualified domain name is case-insensitive and
terminated by a dot character (&rsquo;.&rsquo;). For
NIS, the fully qualified domain name is
case-sensitive and is not terminated by a dot
character. For both NIS+ and NIS,
server address> is optional. If it is not
supplied, a host name lookup will be performed to get the
machine&rsquo;s address.

For example, if
the machine wiz-nisplus-server with address
133.33.33.33 serves the NIS+ domain
wiz.com., the reference would look like this:

wiz.com.
wiz-nisplus-server 133.33.33.33

For NIS,
the reference information is of the form:

domainname>
server name>

For example, if
the machine woz-nis-server serves the NIS
domain Woz.COM, the reference would look like
this:

Woz.COM
woz-nis-server

After obtaining
this information, you then edit the DNS table (see
in.named(1M)) and add a TXT record with this
reference information. The TXT record must be
associated with a DNS domain that includes an
NIS record. For example, the reference information
shown in the examples above would be entered as follows.

For
NIS+:

TXT
"XFNNISPLUS wiz.com. wiz-nisplus-server
133.33.33.33"

For
NIS:

TXT
"XFNNIS woz.com woz-nis-server"

Note the
mandatory double quotes (&rsquo;"&rsquo;)
delimiting the contents of the TXT record. After
making any changes to the DNS table, you must notify
the server by either restarting it or sending it a signal to
reread the table:

#kill -HUP
&rsquo;cat /etc/named.pid&rsquo;

This update
effectively adds the next naming system reference to
DNS. You can look up this reference using
fnlookup(1) to see if the information has been added
properly. For example, the following command looks up the
next naming system reference of the DNS domain
Wiz.COM:

#fnlookup -v
.../Wiz.COM/

Note the
mandatory trailing slash (&rsquo;/&rsquo;).

After this
administrative step has been taken, clients outside of the
NIS+ hierarchy or NIS domain can access and
perform operations on the contexts in the NIS+
hierarchy or NIS domain. Foreign NIS+ clients
access the hierarchy as unauthenticated NIS+ clients.
Continuing the example above, and assuming that NIS+
is federated underneath the DNS domain
Wiz.COM, you can now list the root of the NIS+
enterprise using the command:

#fnlist
.../Wiz.COM/
