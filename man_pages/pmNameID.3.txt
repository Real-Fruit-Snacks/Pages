NAME

pmNameID
- translate a PMID to a performance metric name

C SYNOPSIS

#include

int
pmNameID(pmID pmid, char
**name);

cc ...
-lpcp

DESCRIPTION

Given a
Performance Metric Identifier (PMID) via pmid,
pmNameID will determine the corresponding metric
name, if any, in the Performance Metrics Name Space (PMNS),
and return this via name.

If the PMNS
contains multiple names associated with the requested PMID,
one of these will be returned via name, but there is
no way to determine which of the duplicate names this will
be. See pmNameAll(3) if all of the corresponding
names are required.

As of Version
3.10.3 of PCP, duplicate names for the same PMID are
allowed in the PMNS, so using pmNameAll(3) is
recommended over pmnameID.

name is
a null-byte terminated string, allocated by pmNameID
using malloc(3) and it is the caller’s
responsibility to call free(3) to release the storage
when the value is no longer required.

In the absence
of errors, pmNameID returns zero.

DIAGNOSTICS

PM_ERR_NOPMNS

Failed to access a PMNS for
operation. Note that if the application hasn’t a
priori called pmLoadNameSpace(3) and wants to use the
distributed PMNS, then a call to pmNameID must be
made after the creation of a context (see
pmNewContext(3)).

PM_ERR_PMID

pmid does not correspond
to a defined PMID in the PMNS.

PM_ERR_*

Other diagnostics are for
protocol failures when accessing the distributed PMNS.
