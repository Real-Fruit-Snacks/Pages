PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       fpclassify — classify real floating type

SYNOPSIS
       #include <math.h>

       int fpclassify(real-floating x);

DESCRIPTION
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with  the
       ISO C  standard.  Any  conflict between the requirements described here
       and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017
       defers to the ISO C standard.

       The  fpclassify() macro shall classify its argument value as NaN, infi‐
       nite, normal, subnormal, zero, or into  another  implementation-defined
       category.   First,  an  argument represented in a format wider than its
       semantic type is converted to its semantic type. Then classification is
       based on the type of the argument.

RETURN VALUE
       The fpclassify() macro shall return the value of the number classifica‐
       tion macro appropriate to the value of its argument.

ERRORS
       No errors are defined.

APPLICATION USAGE

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
