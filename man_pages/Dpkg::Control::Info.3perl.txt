NAME
       Dpkg::Control::Info - parse files like debian/control

DESCRIPTION
       It provides a class to access data of files that follow the same syntax
       as debian/control.

METHODS
       $c = Dpkg::Control::Info->new(%opts)
           Create a new Dpkg::Control::Info object. Loads the file from the
           filename option, if no option is specified filename defaults to
           debian/control.  If a scalar is passed instead, it will be used as
           the filename. If filename is "-", it parses the standard input. If
           filename is undef no loading will be performed.

       $c->reset()
           Resets what got read.

       $c->parse($fh, $description)
           Parse a control file from the given filehandle. Exits in case of
           errors.  $description is used to describe the filehandle, ideally
           it's a filename or a description of where the data comes from. It
           is used in error messages.  The data in the object is reset before
           parsing new control files.

       $c->load($file)
           Load the content of $file. Exits in case of errors. If file is "-",
           it loads from the standard input.

       $c->[0]
       $c->get_source()
           Returns a Dpkg::Control object containing the fields concerning the
           source package.

       $c->get_pkg_by_idx($idx)
           Returns a Dpkg::Control object containing the fields concerning the
           binary package numbered $idx (starting at 1).

       $c->get_pkg_by_name($name)
           Returns a Dpkg::Control object containing the fields concerning the
           binary package named $name.

       $c->get_packages()
           Returns a list containing the Dpkg::Control objects for all binary
           packages.

       $str = $c->output([$fh])
           Return the content info into a string. If $fh is specified print it
           into the filehandle.

       "$c"
           Return a string representation of the content.

       @{$c}
           Return a list of Dpkg::Control objects, the first one is
           corresponding to source information and the following ones are the
           binary packages information.
