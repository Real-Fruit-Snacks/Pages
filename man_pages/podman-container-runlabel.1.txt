NAME
       podman-container-runlabel  -  Executes a command as described by a con‐
       tainer-image label

SYNOPSIS
       podman container runlabel [options] label image [arg...]

DESCRIPTION
       podman container runlabel reads the specified label of  the  image  and
       executes  it as command on the host.  If the label does not exist, Pod‐
       man will exit with an error.  Additional arguments will be appended  to
       the command.

       Historically, container images describe the contents (e.g., layers) and
       how a container runtime (e.g., crun(1) or runc(1)) should  execute  the
       container.  For instance, an image may set the environment and the com‐
       mand in its configuration.  However, a container image cannot  directly
       specify  how  a container engine such as Podman should execute it.  For
       instance, an image configuration does not include information about log
       drivers, namespaces or which capabilities it needs to run correctly.

       podman  container runlabel addresses the limitation of container images
       in a simple yet efficient way.  Podman will read the  contents  of  the
       label  and interpret it as a command that will be executed on the host.
       This way an image can describe exactly how it  should  be  executed  by
       Podman.   For instance, a label with the content /usr/bin/podman run -d
       --pid=host --privileged \${IMAGE} instructs the image to be executed in
       a detached, privileged container that is using the PID namespace of the
       host.  This lifts the self-description of a container image from "what"
       to "how".

       Please  note that the runlabel command is intended to be run in trusted
       environments exclusively.  Using the command on untrusted images is not
       recommended.

VARIABLES
       The contents of a label may refer to the following variables which will
       be substituted while processing the label.

       IMAGE The name of the image.  When executing podman container  runlabel
       label  fedora  the  IMAGE variable will be replaced with fedora.  Valid
       formats are IMAGE, $IMAGE, ${IMAGE} and =IMAGE.

       NAME As specified by the --name option.  The format is identical to the
       one of the IMAGE attribute.

       PWD Will be replaced with the current working directory.

OPTIONS
   --authfile=path
       Path of the authentication file. Default is ${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/contain‐
       ers/auth.json, which is set using podman login.  If  the  authorization
       state  is  not found there, $HOME/.docker/config.json is checked, which
       is set using docker login.

       Note: There is also the option to override the default path of the  au‐
       thentication  file  by setting the REGISTRY_AUTH_FILE environment vari‐
       able. This can be done with export REGISTRY_AUTH_FILE=path.

   --cert-dir=path
       Use certificates at path (*.crt, *.cert, *.key) to connect to the  reg‐
       istry.  (Default:  /etc/containers/certs.d) Please refer to containers-
       certs.d(5) for details.  (This option is not available with the  remote
       Podman client, including Mac and Windows (excluding WSL2) machines)

   --creds=[username[:password]]
       The  [username[:password]] to use to authenticate with the registry, if
       required.  If one or both values  are  not  supplied,  a  command  line
       prompt  will  appear  and the value can be entered. The password is en‐
       tered without echo.

   --display
       Display the label's value of the image having populated its environment
       variables.  The runlabel command will not execute if --display is spec‐
       ified.

   --help, -h
       Print usage statement

   --name, -n=name
       Use this name for creating content for the container.   If  not  speci‐
       fied, name defaults to the name of the image.

   --quiet, -q
       Suppress output information when pulling images

   --replace
       If  a  container exists of the default or given name, as needed it will
       be stopped, deleted and a new container will be created from  this  im‐
       age.

   --tls-verify
       Require  HTTPS  and verify certificates when contacting registries (de‐
       fault: true).  If explicitly set to  true,  TLS  verification  will  be
       used.   If  set  to  false,  TLS verification will not be used.  If not
       specified, TLS verification will be used unless the target registry  is
       listed as an insecure registry in containers-registries.conf(5)

EXAMPLES
       Execute the run label of an image called foobar.

              $ podman container runlabel run foobar

       Execute the install label of an image called foobar with additional ar‐
       guments.

              $ podman container runlabel install foobar apples oranges

       Display the contents of the run label of image foobar.

              $ podman container runlabel --display run foobar
