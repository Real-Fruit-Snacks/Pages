NAME

podman-start -
Start one or more containers

SYNOPSIS

podman
start [options] container ...

podman
container start [options] container
...

DESCRIPTION

Start one or
more containers using container IDs or names as input. The
attach and interactive options cannot be used
to override the --tty and --interactive
options from when the container was created. Starting an
already running container with the --attach option,
Podman simply attaches to the container.

OPTIONS

--all

Start all the containers created by Podman, default is only
running containers.

--attach,
-a 
Attach container’s STDOUT and STDERR. The default is
false. This option cannot be used when starting multiple
containers.

--detach-keys=sequence

Specify the key sequence for detaching a container. Format
is a single character [a-Z] or one or more
ctrl- characters where
 is one of: a-z, @,
^, [, , or _. Specifying
"" disables this feature. The default is
ctrl-p,ctrl-q.

This option can
also be set in containers.conf(5) file.

--filter,
-f 
Filter what containers are going to be started from the
given arguments. Multiple filters can be given with multiple
uses of the --filter flag. Filters with the same key work
inclusive with the only exception being label which
is exclusive. Filters with different keys always work
exclusive.

Valid filters
are listed below:

--interactive, -i 
When set to true, keep stdin open even if not
attached. The default is false.

--latest,
-l 
Instead of providing the container name or ID, use the last
created container. Note: the last started container can be
from other users of Podman on the host machine. (This option
is not available with the remote Podman client, including
Mac and Windows (excluding WSL2) machines)

--sig-proxy

Proxy received signals to the container process. SIGCHLD,
SIGURG, SIGSTOP, and SIGKILL are not proxied.

The default is
true when attaching, false otherwise.
