NAME

dpt-repack --
repackaging helper

SYNOPSIS

dpt
repack --upstream-version version downloaded
file"

DESCRIPTION

dpt
repack helps creating repackaged tarballs, suitable for
feeding dpkg-source(1).

Work is
commenced in three stages:

•

dpt repack unpacks the provided upstream
tarball. 

•

debian/repack.local is sourced to remove
unsuitable content.

•

dpt repack packs the sources again, under a
suitable file name in the form
"package_ver.orig.tar.gz" (suffix
depending on initial compression).

dpt
repack invokes debian/repack.local in an
environment where rm and mv are replaced with
functions that reflect the operations in the
MANIFEST file, if present.
