PROCDESC(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual PROCDESC(4)

NAME

procdesc â€” process
descriptor facility

DESCRIPTION

procdesc is a
file-descriptor-oriented interface to process signalling and
control, which supplements historic UNIX fork(2), kill(2),
and wait4(2) primitives with new system calls such as
pdfork(2), pdkill(2), and pdwait4(2). procdesc is
designed for use with capsicum(4), replacing process
identifiers with capability-oriented references. However, it
can also be used independently of capsicum(4), displacing
PIDs, which may otherwise suffer from race conditions. Given
a process descriptor, it is possible to query its
conventional PID using pdgetpid(2).
