CAS(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual CAS(4)

NAME

cas &mdash; Sun
Cassini/Cassini+ and National Semiconductor DP83065 Saturn
Gigabit Ethernet driver

SYNOPSIS

To compile this driver into the
kernel, place the following lines in your kernel
configuration file:

device
miibus 
device cas

Alternatively,
to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following line in loader.conf(5):

if_cas_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION

The cas driver provides
support for the Sun Cassini/Cassini+ and National
Semiconductor DP83065 Saturn Gigabit Ethernet controllers
found on-board in Sun UltraSPARC machines and as add-on
cards.

All controllers
supported by the cas driver have TCP/UDP checksum
offload capability for both receive and transmit, support
for the reception and transmission of extended frames for
vlan(4) and an interrupt coalescing/moderation mechanism as
well as a 512-bit multicast hash filter.

The cas
driver also supports Jumbo Frames (up to 9022 bytes), which
can be configured via the interface MTU setting. Selecting
an MTU larger than 1500 bytes with the ifconfig(8) utility
configures the adapter to receive and transmit Jumbo
Frames.

HARDWARE

The chips supported by the
cas driver are:

&bull;

National Semiconductor DP83065
Saturn Gigabit Ethernet

&bull;

Sun Cassini Gigabit
Ethernet

&bull;

Sun Cassini+ Gigabit
Ethernet

The following
add-on cards are known to work with the cas driver at
this time:

&bull;

Sun GigaSwift Ethernet 1.0 MMF
(Cassini Kuheen) (part no. 501-5524)

&bull;

Sun GigaSwift Ethernet 1.0 UTP
(Cassini) (part no. 501-5902)

&bull;

Sun GigaSwift Ethernet UTP
(GCS) (part no. 501-6719)

&bull;

Sun Quad GigaSwift Ethernet UTP
(QGE) (part no. 501-6522)

&bull;

Sun Quad GigaSwift Ethernet
PCI-X (QGE-X) (part no. 501-6738)

NOTES

On sparc64 the cas driver
respects the local-mac-address? system configuration
variable which can be set in the Open Firmware boot monitor
using the setenv command or by eeprom(8). If set to
&rsquo;&rsquo;false&rsquo;&rsquo; (the default), the
cas driver will use the system&rsquo;s default MAC
address for all of its devices. If set to
&rsquo;&rsquo;true&rsquo;&rsquo;, the unique MAC address of
each interface is used if present rather than the
system&rsquo;s default MAC address.

Supported
interfaces having their own MAC address include on-board
versions on boards equipped with more than one Ethernet
interface and all add-on cards.

HISTORY

The cas device driver
appeared in FreeBSD 8.0 and FreeBSD 7.3. It is
named after the cas driver which first appeared in
OpenBSD 4.1 and supports the same set of controllers
but is otherwise unrelated.

AUTHORS

The cas driver was
written by Marius Strobl marius [AT] FreeBSD.org>
based on the gem(4) driver.
