ntpdig -
standard Simple Network Time Protocol client program

SYNOPSIS

ntpdig 
[--help | -?] [-4 | -6] [-a keynum] [-p samples] 
[-c] [-d] [-D debug-level] [-g delay] [-j] [-k keyfile] 
[-l logfile] [-M steplimit] [-S] [-s] 
[--wait] [--no-wait] [--version] [address...]+

DESCRIPTION

ntpdig can be
used as an SNTP client to query an NTP or SNTP server and
either display the time or set the local system’s time
(given suitable privilege). It can be run as an interactive
command or from a cron job. NTP (the Network Time
Protocol) and SNTP (the Simple Network Time Protocol) are
defined and described by RFC 5905.

The default is
to write the estimated correct local date and time (i.e. not
UTC) to the standard output in a format like:

2015-10-14
13:46:04.534916 (+0500) -0.000007 +/- 0.084075 localhost
127.0.0.1 s2 no-leap

where the
(+0500) means that to get to UTC from the reported local
time one must add 5 hours and 0 minutes, the -0.000007
indicates the local clock is 0.000007 seconds ahead of
correct time (so 0.000007 seconds must be subtracted from
the local clock to get it to be correct). Note that the
number of decimals printed for this value will change based
on the reported precision of the server. +/- 0.084075 is the
reported synchronization distance (in seconds), which
represents the maximum error due to all causes. If the
server does not report valid data needed to calculate the
synchronization distance, this will be reported as +/-
?.

If the
host is different from the IP, both will be
displayed. Otherwise, only the IP is displayed.
Finally, the stratum of the host is reported and the
leap indicator is decoded and displayed.

With the -j
(JSON) option, the output format becomes a self-describing
JSON record:

{"time":"2015-10-14T13:46:04.534916+0500",

"offset":-0.000007,"precision":"0.084075",

"host":"localhost",ip:"127.0.0.1",

"stratum":2,"leap":"noleap","adjusted":false}

In the JSON
format, time is in ISO 8601 format; precision is the synch
distance, with an unknown synch distance being reported as
0. Host and IP are always emitted even if duplicate. The
"adjusted" boolean reports whether ntpdig
determined it should have slewed or stepped the time. This
may be shown as true even if time was not actually adjusted
due to lack of clock-setting privileges.

OPTIONS

-h, --help

Displays usage information and
exits.

-4, --ipv4

Force IPv4 DNS name resolution.
This option must not appear in combination with any of the
following options: ipv6.

Force DNS
resolution of the following host names on the command line
to the IPv4 namespace.

-6, --ipv6

Force IPv6 DNS name resolution.
This option must not appear in combination with any of the
following options: ipv4.

Force DNS
resolution of the following host names on the command line
to the IPv6 namespace.

-a
auth-keynumber,
--authentication=auth-keynumber

Enable authentication with the
key auth-keynumber. This option takes an integer
number as its argument.

Enable
authentication using the key specified in this
option’s argument. The argument of this option is the
keyid, a number specified in the keyfile as
this key’s identifier. See the keyfile option
(-k) for more details.

-c
host-name, --concurrent=host-name

Concurrently query all IPs
returned for host-name. This option may appear an unlimited
number of times.

Requests from
an NTP "client" to a "server" should
never be sent more rapidly than one every 2 seconds. By
default, any IPs returned as part of a DNS lookup are
assumed to be for a single instance of ntpd, and therefore
ntpdig will send queries to these IPs one after another,
with a 2-second gap in between each query.

The -c or
--concurrent flag says that any IPs returned for the DNS
lookup of the supplied host-name are on different machines,
so we can send concurrent queries. This is appropriate when
using a server pool.

-d,
--debug-level

Increase debug verbosity level.
This option may appear an unlimited number of times.

-D
number, --set-debug-level=number

Set the debug verbosity level.
This option may appear an unlimited number of times. This
option takes an integer number as its argument.

-g
milliseconds, --gap=milliseconds

The gap (in milliseconds)
between time requests. This option takes an integer number
as its argument. The default milliseconds for this
option is 50.

Separate the
queries we send out by the specified number of milliseconds.
A larger delay reduces the query load on the time
sources, at the cost of increasing the time to receive a
valid response if the first source attempted is slow or
unreachable.

-j

Output to stdout in JSON,
suppressing syslog messages.

-k
file-name, --keyfile=file-name

Look in this file for the key
specified with -a.

This option
specifies the keyfile. ntpdig will search for the key
specified with -a keyno in this file. See ntp.keys(5)
for more information.

-l
file-name, --logfile=file-name

Log to specified logfile.

This option
causes the client to write log messages to the specified
logfile.

-M
number, --steplimit=number

Adjustments less than
steplimit milliseconds will be slewed. This option
takes an integer number as its argument. The value of
number is constrained to being greater than or equal
to 0,

If the time
adjustment is less than steplimit milliseconds, slew
the amount using adjtime(2). Otherwise, step the
correction using clock_settime() or local equivalent.
The default value is 0, which means all adjustments will be
stepped. This is a feature, as different situations demand
different values.

-p,
--samples

The number of samples to take
(default 1). The best one (chosen by, among other criteria,
sync distance) is selected for display or use.

-S, --step

By default, ntpdig displays the
clock offset but does not attempt to correct it. This option
enables offset correction by stepping, that is, directly
setting the clock to the corrected time. This typically
requires ntpdig be invoked as the superuser
("root").

-s, --slew

By default, ntpdig displays the
clock offset but does not attempt to correct it. This option
enables offset correction by slewing using adjtime(), which
changes the rate of the clock for a period long enough to
accomplish the required offset (phase) correction. This
typically requires ntpdig be invoked as the superuser
("root").

-t
seconds, --timeout=seconds

The number of seconds to wait
for responses. This option takes an integer number as its
argument. The default seconds for this option is:
5.

When waiting
for a reply, ntpdig will wait the number of seconds
specified before giving up. The default should be more than
enough for a unicast response. If ntpdig is only waiting for
a broadcast response a longer timeout is likely needed.

--wait,
--no-wait

Wait for pending replies (if
not setting the time). The no-wait form will disable
the option. This option is enabled by default.

If we are not
setting the time, wait for all pending responses.

--version

Output version of program and
exit.

USAGE

ntpdig
ntpserver.somewhere

is the simplest use of this
program and can be run as an unprivileged command to check
the current time and error in the local clock.

ntpdig -S -s -M
128 ntpserver.somewhere

With suitable privilege, run as
a command or from a cron(8) job, ntpdig -Ss -M 128
ntpserver.somewhere will request the time from the server,
and if that server reports that it is synchronized then if
the offset adjustment is less than 128 milliseconds the
correction will be slewed, and if the correction is more
than 128 milliseconds the correction will be stepped.

ntpdig -S
ntpserver.somewhere

With suitable privilege, run as
a command or from a cron(8) job, ntpdig -S
ntpserver.somewhere will set (step) the local clock from a
synchronized specified server, like the ntpdate utility from
older NTP implementations.

COMPATIBILITY

Not all options
of the NTP classic sntp(1) utility have been retained;
don’t expect -b, -K, -o, -r, -w, or -W to work. These
have either been removed for security reasons or discarded
as unnecessary in a modern environment.

This version
does not log to syslog. Pipe standard output and standard
error to logger(1) if you want this behavior.

The
synchronization-distance formula used in this version is
slightly different from that found in sntp(1), tracking the
newer formula used in ntpd(8). Expect offset computations to
match but synch-distances not to.
