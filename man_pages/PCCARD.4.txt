PCCARD(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual PCCARD(4)

NAME

pccard &mdash; PC Card
bus driver

SYNOPSIS

device pccard

DESCRIPTION

The pccard driver
implements the PC Card bus. The pccard driver
supports all PC Card bridges in the system.

TUNABLES

The driver supports the
following tunable parameters, which may be added to
/boot/loader.conf or set via the sysctl(8)
command:

hw.pccard.debug

Non-zero values
cause more verbose information to be printed when a 16-bit
PC Card is inserted or removed.

hw.pccard.cis_debug

Non-zero value
causes the CIS parsing of the 16-bit PC Card to be much more
verbose and include a complete CIS dump.

FILES 
/dev/pccard0.cis

This
exclusive-use device will report all the CIS chains present
in a PC Card, if a 16-bit PC Card is inserted in the slot.
Only one user at a time may access the CIS. The CIS is
presented as the relevant byte stream from the PC Card. For
CIS tuples in Attribute Memory (the default), only the even
locations are presented (the ODD locations are undefined per
the standard). For CIS tuples in Common Memory, every byte
is presented to the user. Decoding of the CIS tuples is done
via a userland program. All tuples are presented to the
user.
