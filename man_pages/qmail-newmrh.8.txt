NAME

qmail-newmrh -
prepare morercpthosts for qmail-smtpd

SYNOPSIS

qmail-newmrh

DESCRIPTION

qmail-newmrh
reads the instructions in
/var/lib/qmail/control/morercpthosts and writes them
into /var/lib/qmail/control/morercpthosts.cdb in a
binary format suited for quick access by
qmail-smtpd.

If there is a
problem with control/morercpthosts,
qmail-newmrh complains and leaves
control/morercpthosts.cdb alone.

qmail-newmrh
ensures that control/morercpthosts.cdb is updated
atomically, so qmail-smtpd never has to wait for
qmail-newmrh to finish. However, qmail-newmrh
makes no attempt to protect against two simultaneous updates
of control/morercpthosts.cdb.

The binary
control/morercpthosts.cdb format is portable across
machines.
