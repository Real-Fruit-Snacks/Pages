NAME

fixcvsdiff -
fix problematic diff files

SYNOPSIS

fixcvsdiff [-p] [-b]
[file...] 

DESCRIPTION

fixcvsdiff
modifies diff files created from the cvs diff
command, where files have been added or removed. CVS tends
to create diff files that patch(1) mis-interprets.
The diff file must retain the lines beginning with
“Index:” in order for the correction to
work.

OPTIONS

-b

Keep a .bak backup file.

-p

Print out the cvs add
and cvs remove commands that must be made after
applying the diff, but before running cvs commit.

SEE ALSO

diff(1),
patch(1), cvs(1)
