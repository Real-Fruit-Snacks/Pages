GETTIMEOFDAY(3POSIX)       POSIX Programmer's Manual      GETTIMEOFDAY(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       gettimeofday — get the date and time

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/time.h>

       int gettimeofday(struct timeval *restrict tp, void *restrict tzp);

DESCRIPTION
       The gettimeofday() function shall obtain the current time, expressed as
       seconds  and  microseconds since the Epoch, and store it in the timeval
       structure pointed to by tp.  The resolution of the system clock is  un‐
       specified.

       If tzp is not a null pointer, the behavior is unspecified.

RETURN VALUE
       The  gettimeofday()  function  shall return 0 and no value shall be re‐
       served to indicate an error.

ERRORS
       No errors are defined.

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       Applications should use the clock_gettime() function instead of the ob‐
       solescent gettimeofday() function.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       The gettimeofday() function may be removed in a future version.
