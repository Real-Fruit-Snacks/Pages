Description

indxbib
makes an inverted index for the bibliographic databases in
each file for use with refer(1),
lookbib(1), and lkbib(1). Each created index
is named file.i; writing is done to a temporary file
which is then renamed to this. If no file operands
are given on the command line because the -f option
has been used, and no -o option is given, the index
will be named Ind.i.

Bibliographic
databases are divided into records by blank lines. Within a
record, each field starts with a % character at the
beginning of a line. Fields have a one letter name that
follows the % character.

The values set
by the -c, -l, -n, and -t
options are stored in the index: when the index is searched,
keys will be discarded and truncated in a manner appropriate
to these options; the original keys will be used for
verifying that any record found using the index actually
contains the keys. This means that a user of an index need
not know whether these options were used in the creation of
the index, provided that not all the keys to be searched for
would have been discarded during indexing and that the user
supplies at least the part of each key that would have
remained after being truncated during indexing. The value
set by the -i option is also stored in the index and
will be used in verifying records found using the index.

Options

--help
displays a usage message, while -v and
--version show version information; all exit
afterward. 
-c common-words-file

Read the list of common words
from common-words-file instead of
/usr/share/groff/1.23.0/eign.

-d dir

Use dir as the name of the directory to store in
the index, instead of that returned by getcwd(2).
Typically, dir will be a symbolic link whose target
is the current working directory.

-f list-file

Read the files to be indexed
from list-file. If list-file is -,
files will be read from the standard input stream. The
-f option can be given at most once.

-h min-hash-table-size

Use the first prime number
greater than or equal to the argument for the size of the
hash table. Larger values will usually make searching
faster, but will make the index file larger and cause
indxbib to use more memory. The default hash table
size is 997.

-i excluded-fields

Don&rsquo;t index the contents
of fields whose names are in excluded-fields. Field
names are one character each. If this option is not present,
indxbib excludes fields X, Y, and
Z.

-k max-keys-per-record

Use no more keys per input
record than specified in the argument. If this option is not
present, the maximum is 100.

-l min-key-length

Discard any key whose length in
characters is shorter than the value of the argument. If
this option is not present, the minimum key length is 3.

-n threshold

Discard the threshold
most common words from the common words file. If this option
is not present, the 100 most common words are discarded.

-o basename

Name the index
basename.i.

-t max-key-length

Truncate keys to
max-key-length in characters. If this option is not
present, keys are truncated to 6 characters.

-w

Index whole files. Each file is a separate record.

Files

file.i

index for file

Ind.i

default index name

/usr/share/groff/1.23.0/eign

contains the list of common
words. The traditional name, &ldquo;eign&rdquo;, is
an abbreviation of &ldquo;English ignored [word
list]&rdquo;.
