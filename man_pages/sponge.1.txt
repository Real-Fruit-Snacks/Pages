NAME
       sponge - soak up standard input and write to a file

SYNOPSIS
       sed '...' file | grep '...' | sponge [-a] file

DESCRIPTION
       sponge reads standard input and writes it out to the specified file.
       Unlike a shell redirect, sponge soaks up all its input before writing
       the output file. This allows constructing pipelines that read from and
       write to the same file.

       sponge preserves the permissions of the output file if it already
       exists.

       When possible, sponge creates or updates the output file atomically by
       renaming a temp file into place. (This cannot be done if TMPDIR is not
       in the same filesystem.)

       If the output file is a special file or symlink, the data will be
       written to it, non-atomically.

       If no file is specified, sponge outputs to stdout.

OPTIONS
       -a
           Replace the file with a new file that contains the file's original
           content, with the standard input appended to it. This is done
           atomically when possible.
