UDPLITE(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual UDPLITE(4)

NAME

udplite â€”
Lightweight User Datagram Protocol

SYNOPSIS

#include 

#include  
#include 

int

socket(AF_INET,
SOCK_DGRAM, IPPROTO_UDPLITE);

DESCRIPTION

The UDP-Lite protocol provides a
partial checksum which allows corrupted packets to be
transmitted to the receiving application. This has
advantages for some types of multimedia transport that may
be able to make use of slightly damaged datagrams, rather
than having them discarded by lower-layer protocols.

UDP-Lite
supports a number of socket options which can be set with
setsockopt(2) and tested with getsockopt(2):

UDPLITE_SEND_CSCOV

This option
sets the sender checksum coverage. A value of zero indicates
that all sent packets will have full checksum coverage. A
value of 8 to 65535 limits the checksum coverage of all sent
packets to the value given.

UDPLITE_RECV_CSCOV

This option is
the receiver-side analogue. A value of zero instructs the
kernel to drop all received packets not having full checksum
coverage. A value of 8 to 65535 instructs the kernel to drop
all received packets with a partial checksum coverage
smaller than the value specified.

ERRORS

A socket operation may fail with
one of the following errors returned:

[EISCONN]

when trying to
establish a connection on a socket which already has one, or
when trying to send a datagram with the destination address
specified and the socket is already connected;

[ENOTCONN]

when trying to
send a datagram, but no destination address is specified,
and the socket has not been connected;

[ENOBUFS]

when the system
runs out of memory for an internal data structure;

[EADDRINUSE]

when an attempt
is made to create a socket with a port which has already
been allocated;

[EADDRNOTAVAIL]

when an attempt
is made to create a socket with a network address for which
no network interface exists.
