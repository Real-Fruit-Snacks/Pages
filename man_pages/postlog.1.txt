NAME

postlog -
Postfix-compatible logging utility

SYNOPSIS

postlog
[-iv] [-c config_dir] [-p
priority] [-t tag] [text...]

DESCRIPTION

The
postlog(1) command implements a Postfix-compatible
logging interface for use in, for example, shell
scripts.

By default,
postlog(1) logs the text given on the command
line as one record. If no text is specified on the
command line, postlog(1) reads from standard input
and logs each input line as one record.

By default,
logging is sent to syslogd(8) or postlogd(8);
when the standard error stream is connected to a terminal,
logging is sent there as well.

The following
options are implemented: 
-c config_dir

Read the main.cf
configuration file in the named directory instead of the
default configuration directory.

-i (obsolete)

Include the process ID in the
logging tag. This flag is ignored as of Postfix 3.4, where
the PID is always included.

-p priority
(default: info)

Specifies the logging severity:
info, warn, error, fatal, or
panic. With Postfix 3.1 and later, the program will
pause for 1 second after reporting a fatal or
panic condition, just like other Postfix
programs.

-t tag

Specifies the logging tag, that is, the identifying name
that appears at the beginning of each logging record. A
default tag is used when none is specified.

-v

Enable verbose logging for debugging purposes. Multiple
-v options make the software increasingly
verbose. 

SECURITY

The
postlog(1) command is designed to run with
set-groupid privileges, so that it can connect to the
postlogd(8) daemon process (Postfix 3.7 and later;
earlier implementations of this command must not have
set-groupid or set-userid permissions).

ENVIRONMENT

MAIL_CONFIG

Directory with the
main.cf file.

CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS

The following
main.cf parameters are especially relevant to this
program.

The text below
provides only a parameter summary. See postconf(5)
for more details including examples. 
config_directory (see &rsquo;postconf -d&rsquo;
output)

The default location of the
Postfix main.cf and master.cf configuration files.

import_environment (see
&rsquo;postconf -d&rsquo; output)

The list of environment
variables that a privileged Postfix process will import from
a non-Postfix parent process, or name=value environment
overrides.

syslog_facility
(mail)

The syslog facility of Postfix
logging.

syslog_name (see
&rsquo;postconf -d&rsquo; output)

A prefix that is prepended to
the process name in syslog records, so that, for example,
"smtpd" becomes "prefix/smtpd".

Available in
Postfix 3.4 and later: 
maillog_file (empty)

The name of an optional logfile
that is written by the Postfix postlogd(8)
service.

postlog_service_name
(postlog)

postlogd(8) service entry in master.cf.

Available in
Postfix 3.9 and later:

The file access permissions
that will be set when the file $maillog_file is created for
the first time, or when the file is created after an
existing file is rotated.
