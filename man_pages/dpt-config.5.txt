NAME

dpt-config --
dpt configuration

DESCRIPTION

dpt(1)
configuration lives in plain text files using
POSIX shell syntax. The files are sourced by
the tools, not parsed.

LOCATION

Configuration
files are looked for in the following locations, in order,
and every found file is sourced by the script, later files
possibly overriding the previous ones. 
~/.dpt.conf 
~/.config/dpt.conf

TIPS & TRICKS

Run
dpt(1) from git 
When bugs in dpt(1) are fixed or new features are
implemented in git but not yet available in the uploaded
version, you may want to run dpt and its sub-scripts from
your local clone of the pkg-perl-tools repository.
This can be done by setting the following variables in
.dpt.conf:

    # needed anyway, adjust path
    DPT_PACKAGES=~/src/pkg-perl/packages
    # specific for running from git
    DPT__SCRIPTS=$DPT_PACKAGES/pkg-perl-tools/scripts
    export PERL5LIB=$DPT_PACKAGES/pkg-perl-tools/lib

Storing
tokens 
If you keep your configuration files in a (potentially)
public git repository, you might be wary of sticking tokens
like DPT_GITHUB_OAUTH or
DPT_SALSA_PRIVATE_TOKEN in your
.dpt.conf. As .dpt.conf is just a shell
fragment which gets sourced, you can put those variables in
a different file (and don&rsquo;t commit this one). E.g.

    [ ! -e ~/.dpt.conf.$(hostname) ] || source ~/.dpt.conf.$(hostname)
