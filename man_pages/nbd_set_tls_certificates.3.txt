NAME

nbd_set_tls_certificates
- set the path to the TLS certificates directory

SYNOPSIS

#include

int nbd_set_tls_certificates ( 
struct nbd_handle *h, const char *dir 
);

DESCRIPTION

Set the path to
the TLS certificates directory. If not set and TLS is used
then a compiled in default is used. For root this is
"/etc/pki/libnbd/". For non-root this is
"$HOME/.pki/libnbd" and
"$HOME/.config/pki/libnbd". If none of these
directories can be found then the system trusted CAs are
used.

This function
may be called regardless of whether TLS is supported, but
will have no effect unless nbd_set_tls(3) is also
used to request or require TLS.

RETURN VALUE

If the call is
successful the function returns 0.

ERRORS

On error -1 is
returned.

Refer to
"ERROR HANDLING" in libnbd(3) for how to
get further details of the error.

The following
parameters must not be NULL: "h", "dir".
For more information see "Non-NULL parameters" in
libnbd(3).
