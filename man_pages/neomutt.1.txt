DESCRIPTION

NeoMutt is a
small but very powerful text based program for reading and
sending electronic mail under Unix operating systems,
including support for color terminals, MIME, OpenPGP, and a
threaded sorting mode.

Note:
This manual page gives a brief overview of NeoMutt&rsquo;s
command line options. You should find a copy of the full
manual in /usr/share/doc/neomutt, in plain text,
HTML, and/or PDF format.

OPTIONS

--

Special argument forces NeoMutt
to stop option parsing and treat remaining arguments as
addresses even if they start with a dash

-A alias

Print an expanded version of
the given alias to stdout and exit

-a file

Attach one or more files
to a message (must be the last option). Add any addresses
after the '--' argument, e.g.:

neomutt
-a image.jpg -- address1 
neomutt -a image.jpg *.png -- address1
address2

-B

Run in batch mode (do not start the ncurses UI)

-b address

Specify a blind carbon copy
(Bcc) recipient

-C

Enable cryptographic operations in the cases in which
they&rsquo;re disabled by default. Those include:

&bull;

Batch mode.

&bull;

Sending a postponed message.

&bull;

Resending a message.

-c address

Specify a carbon copy (Cc)
recipient

-D

Dump all configuration variables as
'name=value' pairs to stdout

-D -O

Like -D, but show one-liner documentation

-D -S

Like -D, but hide the value of sensitive
variables 

-d level

Log debugging output to a file
(default is "~/.neomuttdebug0"). The
level can range from 1&ndash;5 and affects verbosity
(a value of 2 is recommended)

Using this
option along with -l is useful to log the early
startup process (before reading any configuration and hence
$debug_level and $debug_file)

-E

Edit draft (-H) or include
(-i) file during message composition

-e command

Specify a command to be
run after reading the config files

-F config

Specify an alternative
initialization file to read, see FILES section below
for a list of regular configuration files

-f mailbox

Specify a mailbox (as
defined with mailboxes command) to load

-G

Start NeoMutt with a listing of subscribed
newsgroups 

-g server

Like -G, but start at
specified news server

-H draft

Specify a draft file
which contains header and body to use to send a message. If
draft is &ldquo;-&rdquo;, then data is read
from stdin. The draft file is expected to contain just an
RFC822 email &mdash; headers and a body. Although it is not
an mbox file, if an mbox "From " line
is present, it will be silently discarded. Draft files are
processed the same in interactive and batch mode; they are
not passed through untouched. For example, encrypted draft
files will be decrypted.

-h

Print this help message and exit

-i include

Specify an include file
to be embedded in the body of a message

-l file

Specify a file for
debugging output (default
"~/.neomuttdebug0")

This overrules
$debug_file setting and NeoMutt keeps up to five debug logs
({ file | $debug_file | ~/.neomuttdebug
}[0-4]) before override the oldest file

-m type

Specify a default mailbox
format type for newly created folders

The type
is either MH, MMDF, Maildir or mbox (case-insensitive)

-n

Do not read the system-wide configuration file

-p

Resume a prior postponed message, if any

-Q variable

Query a configuration
variable and print its value to stdout (after the
config has been read and any commands executed). Add -O for
one-liner documentation.

-R

Open mailbox in read-only mode

-s subject

Specify a subject (must
be enclosed in quotes if it has spaces)

-v

Print the NeoMutt version and compile-time definitions
and exit

-vv

Print the NeoMutt license and copyright information and
exit 

-y

Start NeoMutt with a listing of all defined
mailboxes 

-Z

Open the first mailbox with new message or exit
immediately with exit code 1 if none is found in all defined
mailboxes 

-z

Open the first or specified (-f) mailbox if it
holds any message or exit immediately with exit code 1
otherwise 

ENVIRONMENT

EDITOR 

Specifies the editor to use if
VISUAL is unset. Defaults to the Vi editor if
unset. 

EGDSOCKET

For OpenSSL since version
0.9.5, files, mentioned at RANDFILE below, can be
Entropy Gathering Daemon (EGD) sockets. Also, and if exists,
~/.entropy and /tmp/entropy will be used to
initialize SSL library functions. Specified sockets must be
owned by the user and have permission of 600 (octal number
representing).

EMAIL

The user&rsquo;s email address.

HOME

Full path of the user&rsquo;s home directory.

MAIL

Full path of the user&rsquo;s spool mailbox.

MAILCAPS

Path to search for mailcap
files. If unset, a RFC1524 compliant search path that is
extended with NeoMutt related paths (at position two and
three): "$HOME/.mailcap:/usr/share/neomutt/
mailcap:/etc/mailcap:/etc/mailcap:/usr/etc/mailcap:/usr/local/
etc/mailcap" will be used instead.

MAILDIR

Full path of the user&rsquo;s
spool mailbox if MAIL is unset. Commonly used when
the spool mailbox is a maildir(5) folder.

MM_NOASK

If this variable is set,
mailcap are always used without prompting first.

NNTPSERVER

Similar to configuration
variable $news_server, specifies the domain name or address
of the default NNTP server to connect. If unset,
/etc/nntpserver is used but can be overridden by
command line option -g.

RANDFILE

Like configuration variable
$entropy_file, defines a path to a file which includes
random data that is used to initialize SSL library
functions. If unset, ~/.rnd is used. DO NOT store
important data in the specified file.

REPLYTO

When set, specifies the default
Reply-To address.

TEXTDOMAINDIR

Defines an absolute path
corresponding to /usr/share/locale that will be
recognised by GNU gettext(1) and used for Native
Language Support (NLS) if enabled.

TMPDIR

Directory in which temporary files are created. Defaults
to /tmp if unset. Configuration variable $tmp_dir
takes precedence over this one.

VISUAL

Specifies the editor to use when composing messages.

XDG_CONFIG_DIRS

Specifies a X Desktop Group
(XDG) compliant location for the system-wide configuration
file, as described in FILES section below. This
variable defaults to /etc/xdg. Bypass loading with
command line option -n.

XDG_CONFIG_HOME

Specifies a XDG compliant
location for the user-specific configuration file, as
described in FILES section below. This variable
defaults to $HOME/.config. Can be overridden by
command line option -F.

FILES

Configuration
files 
NeoMutt will read just the first found configuration file of
system-wide and user-specific category, from the list below
and in that order.

But it allows
building of a recursive configuration by using the
source command.

Other relevant
files 
Unless otherwise stated, NeoMutt will process all grouped
files in the order (from top to bottom) as they are
specified in that listing. 
~/.mailcap 
/etc/mailcap

User-specific and system-wide
definitions for handling non-text MIME types, look at
environment variable MAILCAPS above for additional
search locations.

~/.neomuttdebug0

User&rsquo;s default debug log
file. For further details or customising file path see
command line options -d and -l above.

/etc/mime.types 
/etc/mime.types 
/usr/share/neomutt/mime.types 
~/.mime.types

Description files for simple
plain text mapping between MIME types and filename
extensions. NeoMutt parses these files in the stated order
while processing attachments to determine their MIME
type.

/usr/share/doc/neomutt/manual.{html,pdf,txt}

The full NeoMutt manual in
HTML, PDF or plain text format.

/tmp/neomutt-
XXXX-XXXX-XXXX

Temporary files created by
NeoMutt. For custom locations look at description of the
environment variable TMPDIR above. Notice that the
suffix -XXXX-XXXX-XXXX is just a placeholder for,
e.g. hostname, user name/ID, process ID and/or other random
data.
