STDIN(3POSIX)              POSIX Programmer's Manual             STDIN(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       stderr, stdin, stdout — standard I/O streams

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdio.h>

       extern FILE *stderr, *stdin, *stdout;

DESCRIPTION
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with  the
       ISO C  standard.  Any  conflict between the requirements described here
       and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017
       defers to the ISO C standard.

       A  file with associated buffering is called a stream and is declared to
       be a pointer to a defined type FILE.  The fopen() function shall create
       certain descriptive data for a stream and return a pointer to designate
       the stream in all further transactions. Normally, there are three  open
       streams with constant pointers declared in the <stdio.h> header and as‐
       sociated with the standard open files.

       At program start-up, three streams shall be predefined and need not  be
       opened  explicitly:  standard  input  (for reading conventional input),
       standard output (for writing conventional output), and  standard  error
       (for writing diagnostic output). When opened, the standard error stream
       is not fully buffered; the standard input and standard  output  streams
       are  fully  buffered if and only if the stream can be determined not to
       refer to an interactive device.

       The following symbolic values in <unistd.h> define the file descriptors
       that  shall be associated with the C-language stdin, stdout, and stderr
       when the application is started:

       STDIN_FILENO  Standard input value, stdin.  Its value is 0.

       STDOUT_FILENO Standard output value, stdout.  Its value is 1.

       STDERR_FILENO Standard error value, stderr.  Its value is 2.

       The stderr stream is expected to be open for reading and writing.

RETURN VALUE
       None.

ERRORS
       No errors are defined.
