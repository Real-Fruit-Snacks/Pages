NAME

controlchan -
Channel-fed control message handler

SYNOPSIS

controlchan
[-ch]

DESCRIPTION

controlchan
removes the responsibility for handling control messages
(except cancels) from innd and instead processes them
from a channel or file feed.

The two Perl
modules "Encode" and "MIME::Parser" are
required by controlchan.

To reduce load,
controlchan keeps a copy of control.ctl and
control.ctl.local in memory and checks permissions
(including any required PGP headers) before any scripts are
called. These two configuration files are automatically
reloaded when controlchan notices they have been
modified. Also, the default case of an unrecognized control
article is handled internally. The "drop" case is
handled with far less fuss.

Normally,
controlchan is invoked by innd as configured
in newsfeeds. An example entry is below. Make sure
that the newsgroup "control.cancel" exists so that
controlchan does not have to scan through cancels,
which it will not be processing anyway.

controlchan!\

:!*,control,control.*,!control.cancel\ 
:AC,Tc,Wnsm\ 
:/controlchan

controlchan
can also be manually invoked with a mere path to a file
(containing a complete control article with its headers and
its body) or a token on its standard input:

echo
'/path/to/a/control/article' | controlchan 
echo '@0303465234000000000000235AE000000002@' |
controlchan

Note that in
the (very, very unlikely) event that you need to process
ihave/sendme control messages, be sure that logipaddr
is set to false in inn.conf, because in this case
controlchan needs a site name, not an IP address.

controlchan
tries to report all log messages through syslog(3), unless
connected to an interactive terminal. To enable
syslog(3)&rsquo;ing for versions of Perl prior to 5.6.0, you
will need to have run h2ph on your system include
files at some point (this is required to make
"Sys::Syslog" work). If you have not done so, do
this:

cd /usr/include

h2ph * sys/*

If you run
FreeBSD, you will need to run the following in addition:

h2ph
machine/*

OPTIONS

-c

By default, controlchan
does not process articles whose Date or Injection-Date
header fields are too far in the past (more than
artcutoff days, as set in inn.conf) or one day
in the future. It allows preventing a malicious replay of
old control articles.

Using the
-c flag disables this check on the cutoff date.

-h

Gives usage information.
