NAME
       mat2 - the metadata anonymisation toolkit 2

SYNOPSIS
       mat2 [-h] [-v] [-l] [-V] [-s | -L] [files [files ...]]

DESCRIPTION
       mat2  removes metadata from various fileformats. It supports a wide va‐
       riety of file formats, audio, office, images, …

       Careful, mat2 does not clean files in-place, instead, it will produce a
       file  with  the  word "cleaned" between the filename and its extension,
       for example "filename.cleaned.png" for a file named "filename.png".

OPTIONS
   positional arguments:
       files  the files to process

   optional arguments:
       -h, --help
              show this help message and exit

       -v, --version
              show program's version number and exit

       -l, --list
              list all supported fileformats

       --check-dependencies
              check if mat2 has all the dependencies it needs

       -V, --verbose
              show more verbose status information

       --unknown-members policy
              how to handle unknown members  of  archive-style  files  (policy
              should be one of: abort, omit, keep)

       -s, --show
              list harmful metadata detectable by mat2 without removing them

       -L, --lightweight
              remove SOME metadata

       --no-sandbox
              disable bubblewrap's sandboxing

       --inplace
              clean in place, without backup

EXAMPLES
       To remove all the metadata from a PDF file:

              mat2 ./myfile.pdf

NOTES ABOUT METADATA
       While  mat2  is doing its very best to display metadata when the --show
       flag is passed, it doesn't mean that a file is clean from any  metadata
       if mat2 doesn't show any. There is no reliable way to detect every sin‐
       gle possible metadata for complex file formats.

       This is why you shouldn't rely on metadata's presence to decide if your
       file must be cleaned or not.

       Moreover, mat2 goes to great lengths to make sure that as much metadata
       as possible are removed. This might sometimes result in a loss of qual‐
       ity  of  the  processed files. For example, textual based pdf file con‐
       verted into image based one means that it'll be no longer  possible  to
       select  text  in  them.  If you're experiencing this, you might want to
       give the lightweight cleaning mode a try, but keep in mind by doing so,
       some metadata won't be cleaned.

BUGS
       While  mat2  does  its  very best to remove every single metadata, it's
       still in beta, and some might remain. Should you encounter some issues,
       check the bugtracker: https://0xacab.org/jvoisin/mat2/issues

       Please use accordingly and be careful.
