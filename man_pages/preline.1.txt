NAME

preline -
prepend lines to message

SYNOPSIS

in
.qmailext: | preline command

DESCRIPTION

preline
feeds each incoming mail message through command. At
the top of each message it inserts a UUCP-style From_
line, a Return-Path line, and a Delivered-To
line.

preline
is useful for procmail and ELM&rsquo;s filter,
which do not understand the qmail-command environment
variables.

OPTIONS

-d

Do not include the
Delivered-To line. You should use this option when
the recipient of the incoming mail message is actually under
remote control, but was sent here through
control/virtualdomains for manual routing.

-f

Do not include the From_ line. You should use
this option except for commands that create
mbox files.

-r

Do not include the Return-Path line.
