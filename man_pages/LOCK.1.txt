LOCK(1) BSD General Commands Manual LOCK(1)

NAME

lock &mdash; reserve a
terminal

SYNOPSIS

lock [&minus;p]
[&minus;t timeout]

DESCRIPTION

lock requests a password
from the user, reads it again for verification and then will
normally not relinquish the terminal until the password is
repeated. There are two other conditions under which it will
terminate: it will timeout after some interval of time and
it may be killed by someone with the appropriate
permission.

Options:

&minus;p

A password is
not requested, instead the user&rsquo;s current login
password is used. If the user has an S/Key key, they may
also use it to unlock the terminal. To do this the user
should enter "s/key" at the unlock
"Key:" prompt. The user will then be issued an
S/Key challenge to which they may respond with a six-word
S/Key one-time password.

&minus;t
timeout

The time limit
(default 15 minutes) is changed to timeout
minutes.
