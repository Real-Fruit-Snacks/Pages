FABS(3POSIX)               POSIX Programmer's Manual              FABS(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       fabs, fabsf, fabsl — absolute value function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <math.h>

       double fabs(double x);
       float fabsf(float x);
       long double fabsl(long double x);

DESCRIPTION
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with  the
       ISO C  standard.  Any  conflict between the requirements described here
       and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017
       defers to the ISO C standard.

       These  functions  shall  compute  the  absolute value of their argument
       x,|x|.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, these functions shall return  the  absolute
       value of x.

       If x is NaN, a NaN shall be returned.

       If x is ±0, +0 shall be returned.

       If x is ±Inf, +Inf shall be returned.

ERRORS
       No errors are defined.

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
   Computing the 1-Norm of a Floating-Point Vector
       This  example shows the use of fabs() to compute the 1-norm of a vector
       defined as follows:

           norm1(v) = |v[0]| + |v[1]| + ... + |v[n-1]|

       where |x| denotes the absolute value of x, n denotes the  vector's  di‐
       mension v[i] denotes the i-th component of v (0≤i<n).

           #include <math.h>

           double
           norm1(const double v[], const int n)
           {
               int     i;
               double  n1_v;  /* 1-norm of v */

               n1_v = 0;
               for (i=0; i<n; i++) {
                   n1_v += fabs (v[i]);
               }

               return n1_v;
           }

APPLICATION USAGE
       None.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
