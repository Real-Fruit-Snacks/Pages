NAME
       pktopbm - convert packed (PK) format font into PBM

SYNOPSIS
       pktopbm pkfile[.pk] [ -x width ] [ -y height ] [-c num] pbmfile ...

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       pktopbm reads a packed (PK) font file as input, and produces PBM images
       as output. If the filename "-" is used for any of  the  filenames,  the
       standard  input  stream  (or standard output where appropriate) will be
       used. If either the width or height is specified, this  value  will  be
       used  for  all  bitmaps produced. Also if one or both values are speci‐
       fied, the bitmap will be relocated with the hoffset and  voffset  given
       in the pkfile. The basepoint will be placed in the lower left corner of
       the bitmap if the bitmap is bigger than the specified size it  will  be
       truncated at the top or right.

OPTIONS
       In  addition  to  the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm
       (most notably -quiet, see
        Common Options ⟨index.html#commonoptions⟩ ),  pktopbm  recognizes  the
       following command line options:

       -c num Sets the character number of the next bitmap written to num.

       -x width
              Sets the width of the image in columns.

       -y width
              Sets the height of the image in rows.
