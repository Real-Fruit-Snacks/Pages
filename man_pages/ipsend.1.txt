 [TCP-flags]

DESCRIPTION

ipsend
can be compiled in two ways. The first is used to send
one-off packets to a destination host, using command line
options to specify various attributes present in the
headers. The destination must be given as the last
command line option, except for when TCP flags are specified
as a combination of A, S, F, U, P and R, last.

The other way
it may be compiled, with DOSOCKET defined, is to allow an
attempt at making a TCP connection using a with ipsend
resending the SYN packet as per the command line
options.

OPTIONS

&minus;d

enable debugging mode.

&minus;f

The -f allows the IP
offset field in the IP header to be set to an arbitrary
value, which can be specified in decimal or hexadecimal.

&minus;g

Specify the hostname of the
gateway through which to route packets. This is required
whenever the destination host isn&rsquo;t directly attached
to the same network as the host from which you&rsquo;re
sending.

&minus;i

Set the interface name to be
the name supplied.

&minus;m

Specify the MTU to be used when
sending out packets. This option allows you to set a fake
MTU, allowing the simulation of network interfaces with
small MTU&rsquo;s without setting them so.

&minus;o

Specify options to be included
at the end of the IP header. An EOL option is automatically
appended and need not be given. If an option would also have
data associated with it (source as an IP# for a lsrr
option), then this will not be initialised.

&minus;s

Set the source address in the
packet to that provided - maybe either a hostname or
IP#.

&minus;t
port>

Set the destination port for
TCP/UDP packets.

&minus;w

Set the window size for TCP
packets.

&minus;I

Set the protocol to ICMP.

&minus;P

Set the protocol to the value
given. If the parameter is a name, the name is looked up in
the /etc/protocols file.

&minus;T

Set the protocol to TCP.

&minus;U

Set the protocol to UDP.

&minus;v

enable verbose mode.
