DESCRIPTION
       caja-actions is an extension for the caja file manager which allows ar‐
       bitrary programa to be launched through the caja popup menu.  Each time
       you  right-click  on  one  or several files in caja, or any part of the
       background of the currently opened folder, caja-actions  will  look  at
       its  configured actions to see if a program has been setup for this se‐
       lection. If so, it will add an item to the menu that allows you to exe‐
       cute  the  program on the selected files.  Configurations are stored in
       DConf for speed and integration with other MATE programs.
