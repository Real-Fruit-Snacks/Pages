RUE(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual RUE(4)

NAME

rue &mdash; RealTek
RTL8150 USB to Fast Ethernet controller driver

SYNOPSIS

To compile this driver into the
kernel, place the following lines in your kernel
configuration file:

device uhci

device ohci 
device usb 
device miibus 
device uether 
device rue

Alternatively,
to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following line in loader.conf(5):

if_rue_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION

The rue driver provides
support for USB Ethernet adapters based on the RealTek
RTL8150 USB to Fast Ethernet controller chip.

The RTL8150
contains an integrated Fast Ethernet MAC, which supports
both 10 and 100Mbps speeds in either full or half duplex.
Although designed to interface with 100Mbps peripheral, the
existing USB standard specifies a maximum transfer speed of
12Mbps. Users should therefore not expect to actually
achieve 100Mbps speeds with this device.

The rue
driver supports the following media types:

autoselect

Enable auto
selection of the media type and options. The user can
manually override the auto selected mode by adding media
options to the /etc/rc.conf file.

10baseT/UTP

Set 10Mbps
operation. The mediaopt option can also be used to
select either full-duplex or half-duplex
modes.

100baseTX

Set 100Mbps
(Fast Ethernet) operation. The mediaopt option can
also be used to select either full-duplex or
half-duplex modes.

The rue
driver supports the following media options:

full-duplex

Force full
duplex operation.

half-duplex

Force half
duplex operation.

For more
information on configuring this device, see ifconfig(8).

DIAGNOSTICS

rue%d: watchdog
timeout  A packet was queued for transmission and a
transmit command was issued, however the device failed to
acknowledge the transmission before a timeout expired.

rue%d: rx
list init failed  The driver failed to allocate an
mbuf for the transmitter ring.

rue%d: no
memory for rx list  The driver failed to allocate
an mbuf for the receiver ring.
