NAME

curl_global_init_mem
- Global libcurl initialisation with memory callbacks

SYNOPSIS

#include

CURLcode curl_global_init_mem(long flags, 
curl_malloc_callback m, 
curl_free_callback f, 
curl_realloc_callback r, 
curl_strdup_callback s, 
curl_calloc_callback c );

DESCRIPTION

This function
works exactly as curl_global_init(3) with one
addition: it allows the application to set callbacks to
replace the otherwise used internal memory functions.

If you are
using libcurl from multiple threads or libcurl was built
with the threaded resolver option then the callback
functions must be thread safe. The threaded resolver is a
common build option to enable (and in some cases the
default) so we strongly urge you to make your callback
functions thread safe.

All callback
arguments must be set to valid function pointers. The
prototypes for the given callbacks must match these: 
void *malloc_callback(size_t size);

To replace malloc()

void free_callback(void
*ptr);

To replace free()

void *realloc_callback(void
*ptr, size_t size);

To replace realloc()

char *strdup_callback(const
char *str);

To replace strdup()

void *calloc_callback(size_t
nmemb, size_t size);

To replace calloc()

This function is otherwise the
same as curl_global_init(3), please refer to that man
page for documentation.

CAUTION

Manipulating
these gives considerable powers to the application to
severely screw things up for libcurl. Take care!
