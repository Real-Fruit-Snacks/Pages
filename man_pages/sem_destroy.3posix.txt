SEM_DESTROY(3POSIX)        POSIX Programmer's Manual       SEM_DESTROY(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       sem_destroy — destroy an unnamed semaphore

SYNOPSIS
       #include <semaphore.h>

       int sem_destroy(sem_t *sem);

DESCRIPTION
       The sem_destroy() function shall destroy the  unnamed  semaphore  indi‐
       cated  by  sem.  Only a semaphore that was created using sem_init() may
       be destroyed using sem_destroy(); the effect of  calling  sem_destroy()
       with  a  named  semaphore is undefined. The effect of subsequent use of
       the semaphore sem is undefined until sem is  reinitialized  by  another
       call to sem_init().

       It  is  safe  to destroy an initialized semaphore upon which no threads
       are currently blocked. The effect of destroying a semaphore upon  which
       other threads are currently blocked is undefined.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon  successful  completion, a value of zero shall be returned. Other‐
       wise, a value of -1 shall be returned and errno set to indicate the er‐
       ror.

ERRORS
       The sem_destroy() function may fail if:

       EINVAL The sem argument is not a valid semaphore.

       EBUSY  There are currently processes blocked on the semaphore.
