DESCRIPTION

dpt
dch-note is a helper program for adding notes to
debian/changelog file. These can be useful for
keeping track of TODO items or signaling
PET to ignore new upstream releases.

OPTIONS

--ignore

--ignore-version

Add an "IGNORE-VERSION:
version" comment. This is useful for instructing
PET that this upstream release contains no
changes that warrant an upload, for example changes in
META files or fixes concerning only non-UNIX
platforms.

--waits package
version 
--waits-for package version

Add a "WAITS-FOR:
package version" comment. This is useful to
indicate that uploading of this package needs another
package to be uploaded first. This also instructs
PET not to show this package as ready for
uploading until the required package version is available in
the archive.

--unreleased

Change distribution in
debian/changelog to "unreleased".
This is done to indicate that the package needs more work
and is not ready for reviewing/uploading.
