NAME

archpath -
output arch (tla/Bazaar) archive names, with support for
branches

SYNOPSIS

archpath

archpath branch 
archpath branch--version

DESCRIPTION

archpath
is intended to be run in an arch (tla or Bazaar) working
copy.

In its simplest
usage, archpath with no parameters outputs the
package name (archive/category--branch--version) associated
with the working copy.

If a parameter
is given, it may either be a branch--version, in which case
archpath will output a corresponding package name in
the current archive and category, or a plain branch name
(without &rsquo;--"), in which case archpath
will output a corresponding package name in the current
archive and category and with the same version as the
current working copy.

This is useful
for branching. For example, if you&rsquo;re using Bazaar and
you want to create a branch for a new feature, you might use
a command like this:

baz branch
$(archpath) $(archpath new-feature)

Or if you want
to tag your current code onto a &rsquo;releases&rsquo;
branch as version 1.0, you might use a command like
this:

baz branch
$(archpath) $(archpath releases--1.0)

That&rsquo;s
much easier than using &rsquo;baz tree-version&rsquo; to
look up the package name and manually modifying the
result.
