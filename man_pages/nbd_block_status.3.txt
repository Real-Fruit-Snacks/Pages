NAME

nbd_block_status
- send block status command, with 32-bit callback

SYNOPSIS

#include

typedef struct { 
int (*callback) (void *user_data, 
const char *metacontext, 
uint64_t offset, uint32_t *entries, 
size_t nr_entries, int *error); 
void *user_data; 
void (*free) (void *user_data); 
} nbd_extent_callback; 
int nbd_block_status ( 
struct nbd_handle *h, uint64_t count, 
uint64_t offset, nbd_extent_callback extent_callback, 
uint32_t flags 
);

DESCRIPTION

Issue the block
status command to the NBD server. If supported by the
server, this causes metadata context information about
blocks beginning from the specified offset to be returned.
The "count" parameter is a hint: the server may
choose to return less status, or the final block may extend
beyond the requested range. If multiple contexts are
supported, the number of blocks and cumulative length of
those blocks need not be identical between contexts.

Note that not
all servers can support a "count" of 4GiB or
larger; nbd_get_extended_headers_negotiated(3)
indicates which servers will parse a request larger than 32
bits. The NBD protocol does not yet have a way for a client
to learn if the server will enforce an even smaller maximum
block status size, although a future extension may add a
constraint visible in nbd_get_block_size(3).
Furthermore, this function is inherently limited to 32-bit
values. If the server replies with a larger extent, the
length of that extent will be truncated to just below 32
bits and any further extents from the server will be
ignored. If the server replies with a status value larger
than 32 bits (only possible when extended headers are in
use), the callback function will be passed an
"EOVERFLOW" error. To get the full extent
information from a server that supports 64-bit extents, you
must use nbd_block_status_64(3).

Depending on
which metadata contexts were enabled before connecting (see
nbd_add_meta_context(3)) and which are supported by
the server (see nbd_can_meta_context(3)) this call
returns information about extents by calling back to the
"extent" function. The callback cannot call
"nbd_*" APIs on the same handle since it holds the
handle lock and will cause a deadlock. If the callback
returns -1, and no earlier error has been detected, then the
overall block status command will fail with any non-zero
value stored into the callback&rsquo;s "error"
parameter (with a default of "EPROTO"); but any
further contexts will still invoke the callback.

The
"extent" function is called once per type of
metadata available, with the "user_data" passed to
this function. The "metacontext" parameter is a
string such as "base:allocation". The
"entries" array is an array of pairs of integers
with the first entry in each pair being the length (in
bytes) of the block and the second entry being a
status/flags field which is specific to the metadata
context. The number of pairs passed to the function is
"nr_entries/2". The NBD protocol document in the
section about "NBD_REPLY_TYPE_BLOCK_STATUS"
describes the meaning of this array; for contexts known to
libnbd,  contains constants beginning
with "LIBNBD_STATE_" that may help decipher the
values. On entry to the callback, the "error"
parameter contains the errno value of any previously
detected error, but even if an earlier error was detected,
the current "metacontext" and "entries"
are valid.

It is possible
for the extent function to be called more times than you
expect (if the server is buggy), so always check the
"metacontext" field to ensure you are receiving
the data you expect. It is also possible that the extent
function is not called at all, even for metadata contexts
that you requested. This indicates either that the server
doesn&rsquo;t support the context or for some other reason
cannot return the data.

The
"flags" parameter may be 0 for no flags, or may
contain "LIBNBD_CMD_FLAG_REQ_ONE" meaning that the
server should return only one extent per metadata context
where that extent does not exceed "count" bytes;
however, libnbd does not validate that the server obeyed the
flag.

By default,
libnbd will reject attempts to use this function with
parameters that are likely to result in server failure, such
as requesting an unknown command flag. The
nbd_set_strict_mode(3) function can be used to alter
which scenarios should await a server reply rather than
failing fast.

RETURN VALUE

If the call is
successful the function returns 0.

ERRORS

On error -1 is
returned.

Refer to
"ERROR HANDLING" in libnbd(3) for how to
get further details of the error.

The following
parameters must not be NULL: "h". For more
information see "Non-NULL parameters" in
libnbd(3).
