SYNOPSIS

#include

cmap_initialize (cmap_handle_t

DESCRIPTION

The
cmap_initialize function is used to initialize a
connection to the Configuration Map API. Each application
may have several connections to the CMAP API. Each
application uses the handle argument to uniquely
identify the connection. The handle argument is then
used in other function calls to identify the connection to
be used for communication with the CMAP service.

This call
returns the CS_OK value if successful, otherwise an error is
returned.
