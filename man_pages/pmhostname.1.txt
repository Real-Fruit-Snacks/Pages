NAME

pmhostname
- report hostname

SYNOPSIS

pmhostname
[-?] [hostname]

DESCRIPTION

pmhostname
reports the name of the host hostname as returned by
gethostbyname(3).

If
hostname is not specified, then the local host name
is retrieved using gethostname(2) and this is than
passed to gethostbyname(3).

pmhostname
provides a service for shell scripts that mimics the logic
formerly used by Performance Co-Pilot applications when
trying to determine the official name of a host. PCP
applications no longer use DNS-based heuristics, and
therefore this command is deprecated.

If
gethostbyname(3) fails, the input host name (either
hostname or the result from calling
gethostname(2)) is reported.

OPTIONS

The available
command line options are: 
-?, --help

Display usage message and
exit.

PCP ENVIRONMENT

Environment
variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On
each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains
the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).
