Name

ssa2srt â€”
convert SubStation Alpha (SSA) subtitles to SubRip (SRT)

Syntax

ssa2srt
[file...]

Description

ssa2srt is a
rudimentary script to extract the text messages from an SSA
file and write it out again in SRT format. Since SRT does
not know any extensive styleformatting, fonts, colors or
positions, conversion to SRT is usually lossy.

If no filenames
are specified, stdin is read. Output always occurs to
stdout.
