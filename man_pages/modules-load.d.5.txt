NAME

modules-load.d
- Configure kernel modules to load at boot

SYNOPSIS

/etc/modules-load.d/*.conf

/run/modules-load.d/*.conf 
/usr/local/lib/modules-load.d/*.conf 
/usr/lib/modules-load.d/*.conf

DESCRIPTION

systemd-modules-load.service(8)
reads files from the above directories which contain kernel
modules to load during boot in a static list. Each
configuration file is named in the style of
/etc/modules-load.d/program.conf. Note that it is
usually a better idea to rely on the automatic module
loading by PCI IDs, USB IDs, DMI IDs or similar triggers
encoded in the kernel modules themselves instead of static
configuration like this. In fact, most modern kernel modules
are prepared for automatic loading already.

CONFIGURATION FORMAT

The
configuration files should simply contain a list of kernel
module names to load, separated by newlines. Empty lines and
lines whose first non-whitespace character is # or ; are
ignored.

CONFIGURATION DIRECTORIES AND PRECEDENCE

Configuration
files are read from directories in /etc/, /run/,
/usr/local/lib/, and /usr/lib/, in order of precedence, as
listed in the SYNOPSIS section above. Files must have the
".conf" extension. Files in /etc/ override files
with the same name in /run/, /usr/local/lib/, and /usr/lib/.
Files in /run/ override files with the same name under
/usr/.

All
configuration files are sorted by their filename in
lexicographic order, regardless of which of the directories
they reside in. If multiple files specify the same option,
the entry in the file with the lexicographically latest name
will take precedence. Thus, the configuration in a certain
file may either be replaced completely (by placing a file
with the same name in a directory with higher priority), or
individual settings might be changed (by specifying
additional settings in a file with a different name that is
ordered later).

Packages should
install their configuration files in /usr/lib/ (distribution
packages) or /usr/local/lib/ (local installs)
[1] . Files in /etc/ are reserved for the
local administrator, who may use this logic to override the
configuration files installed by vendor packages.

It is
recommended to prefix all filenames with a two-digit number
and a dash to simplify the ordering. It is recommended to
use the range 10-40 for configuration files in /usr/ and the
range 60-90 for configuration files in /etc/ and /run/, to
make sure that local and transient configuration files will
always take priority over configuration files shipped by the
OS vendor.

If the
administrator wants to disable a configuration file supplied
by the vendor, the recommended way is to place a symlink to
/dev/null in the configuration directory in /etc/, with the
same filename as the vendor configuration file. If the
vendor configuration file is included in the initrd image,
the image has to be regenerated.

&#128165; &#128165; &#128163; Please note that those
configuration files must be available at all times. If
/usr/local/ is a separate partition, it may not be available
during early boot, and must not be used for
configuration.
