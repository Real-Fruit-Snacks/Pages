NAME

curl_mime_subparts
- set subparts of a multipart mime part

SYNOPSIS

#include

CURLcode
curl_mime_subparts(curl_mimepart * part,
curl_mime * subparts);

DESCRIPTION

curl_mime_subparts(3)
sets a multipart mime part&rsquo;s content from a mime
structure.

part is
a handle to the multipart part.

subparts
is a mime structure handle holding the subparts. After
curl_mime_subparts succeeds, the mime structure
handle belongs to the multipart part and must not be freed
explicitly. It may however be updated by subsequent calls to
mime API functions.

Setting a
part&rsquo;s contents twice is valid: only the value set by
the last call is retained. It is possible to unassign
previous part&rsquo;s contents by setting subparts to
NULL.

AVAILABILITY

As long as at
least one of HTTP, SMTP or IMAP is enabled. Added in
7.56.0.

RETURN VALUE

CURLE_OK or a
CURL error code upon failure.
