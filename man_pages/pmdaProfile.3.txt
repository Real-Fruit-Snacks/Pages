DESCRIPTION

As part of the
Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) API (see
PMDA(3)), pmdaProfile is the default callback
which handles the receipt of a pmProfile from
pmcd(1). A profile describes the instances that
pmcd requires in the pmResult structure
returned by the next fetch. pmdaProfile simply stores
the new profile.

CAVEAT

The PMDA must
be using PMDA_PROTOCOL_2 or later, as specified in
the call to pmdaDSO(3) or pmdaDaemon(3).
