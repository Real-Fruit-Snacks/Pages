DESCRIPTION

This executable
is part of the package ’mate-control-center’:
The MATE Control Center.

The MATE
network proxy preference tool enables you to configure how
your system connects to networks. You can configure the
desktop to connect to a proxy server, and specify the
details of the proxy server.

A proxy server
is a server that intercepts requests to another server, and
fulfills the request itself, if it can. You can enter the
Domain Name Service (DNS) name or the Internet Protocol (IP)
address of the proxy server.

accepts the standard MATE and GTK options.
