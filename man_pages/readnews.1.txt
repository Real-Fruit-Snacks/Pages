SYNOPSIS

readnews
[ −n newsgroups ] [ −d commands ]
[ −i ] [ −c ] [ −l ]
[ −p ] [ −C ] [ −L ]
[ −Agroup ] [ −Dgroup ]

DESCRIPTION

Readnews
without arguments enters command mode, which allows printing
of unread articles. This is the normal way of using
readnews.

Readnews
maintains a .newsrc file in the user’s home
directory that specifies all news articles already read. It
is updated at the end of each reading session.

Some useful
functions are available which don’t use command mode.
The flags for these are:

−c

Check if there is news, and if so print ’You have
news.’. 

−C

Check if there is news, and print the groups and number
of articles in each group to be read.

−l

List the titles of available news articles.

−p

Print all articles on standard output, and update
newsrc. 

−L

Print the newsgroup subscription list.

−Agroup

Add group to the
subscription list.

−Dgroup

Delete group from the
subscription list.

The remaining
flags mostly determine article selection, and may also
appear in the .newsrc file. Options may be specified
in the .newsrc file by entering lines prefixed with
the word ’options’, followed by the options
arguments. This is most useful with the −n
flag, specifying the usual groups one wishes to subscribe
to. 
−n newsgroups

Select all articles belonging
to newsgroups. Newsgroups is a comma separated
list of newsgroup names. The character ’!’ may
be used to exclude certain groups, and the word
’all’ can be used to match any group. e.g.
’-n all,!net.jokes’

−i

Ignore .newsrc file. It is not read or updated.
This allows selection of articles that have already been
read. 

−d
commands

Disable the commands.
Commands is a string of command characters (see the
next section); entering any command beginning with any of
them will result in an error message.

Some overall
parameters are set by a control file,
/var/lib/news/readnews.ctl, which contains control
lines (each a keyword followed by white space followed by a
value) and comments (each starting with
’#’).

If no
−n option is specified, either by the user or
his .newsrc file, the value specified on the
defsub line of the control file is used as the list
of newsgroups to be presented. A single mandatory newsgroup
may be specified as the value of the mustsub control
line; in the absence of a command-line −n (not
one from a .newsrc), that newsgroup is always
presented to the user even if he did not ask for it. Both
defsub and mustsub default to
’’general’’.

COMMANDS

This section
details the commands available when readnews is in
command mode (no −clpsC arguments). The
simplest way of using this mode, is to enter RETURN after
every prompt. This will present to the user, a short heading
for an article, then a prompt. Typing RETURN again will
print the article body. Typing RETURN yet again will print
the next heading, and so on. If having read the heading, you
don’t wish to read the article, you may type
’n’ (or ’+’ or ’;’)
which will take you directly to the next heading.

An article is
treated as having been read, if either you have seen the
article body, or typed ’n’ to skip over it.

A number of
commands operate on the ’current’ article. This
is defined as the article whose header you have most
recently seen.

The commands to
read news are:

RETURN

Either print the current article, or go to the next
article and print its header.

n or + or
;

Go to the next article and
print its header.

.

Print the current article.

−

Go back to the previous article. This is a toggle,
typing it twice returns you to the original article.

number

Go to the article number in the current
newsgroup. Like the ’-’ command, you always
return to the original article after reading the selected
article. 

s [file]

Save the current article,
appending it to the specified file (default
$HOME/articles).

h

Print the current header (slightly more verbose than
normal header).

H

Print the current header in full (very verbose).

N [newsgroup]

Go to the next newsgroup, or to
the specified newsgroup. (A specified newsgroup must be in
the −n list, if any, or subscribed to.)

U

Unsubscribe from this newsgroup, and go to the next
newsgroup. 

!command

Shell escape. Command is
executed. If command is ’!’ the last
escape command is executed.

q or EOT

Quit. The .newsrc file
will be updated provided the flag −i was not
specified.

x

Exit. .newsrc is left unchanged (as if no
articles had been read).

Some commands
are available to send/reply or post news articles:

r

Reply to sender of the current
article by mail. Readnews sets up the appropriate
headers, and then calls mail(1) (or $MAILER, if there
is such an environment variable) to send a reply to the
sender. If there is no mailvia line in the control
file, the address is taken from the
’’From’’ header of the article, and
is in Internet form. If the value in the mailvia line
is ’’’’, the address is
taken from the ’’Path’’ header and
is in UUCPnet form. If the value of mailvia is
something else, the ’’From’’ address
is transformed to UUCPnet syntax
(’’site.x.y!user’’ rather than
’’user [AT] site.y’’), and the
mailvia value is prepended to it, with an intervening
’’!’’. 

f

Post a followup to the current article. Readnews
sets up the appropriate headers, and then calls
postnews(1CN) to post the followup article.

p

Post an article on a new topic. postnews(1CN) is
called to post the new article, in the current newsgroup by
default. 

In order to
permanently resubscribe to a newsgroup denied by
’U’, it is necessary to understand the format of
the .newsrc file. The .newsrc file consists of
two types of lines: 
option lines

These start with the word
’options’ and contain the same arguments as the
readnews command on the command line.

read newsgroup lines

These have the format
’:’ , where
 represents the last item number seen in that
particular newsgroup. If the newsgroup has been
unsubscribed, the ’:’ is replaced by a
’!’. To resubscribe the ’!’ must be
changed back to a ’:’.

EXAMPLES

To invoke
readnews for ’’read only’’
access to specified newsgroups, with the user unable to do
anything but read those groups, a shell file might do:

readnews
−d rfps!U −n newsgroups

which disables
responses (r, f, and p), saving of copies (s), shell escapes
(!), and unsubscribing (U).

HISTORY

Originally
written by Michael Rourke, University of N.S.W
(decvax!mulga!michaelr:elecvax). Modified and simplified for
the C News project.

BUGS

The
mustsub control line really ought to be able to
specify a subscription, i.e. multiple groups.

Control
characters other than tab and backspace are turned into
’#’ when displaying article bodies. This heads
off letter bombs at the price of interfering with use of
non-ASCII character sets.

Cleanup of
command-line syntax has eliminated the old −s
option in favor of −L, −A, and
−D. This is a change for the better, but an
incompatible one.

The
−A and −D options have a nasty
tendency to dump core; they should be fixed or deleted.

This program is
about as simple as they come. Almost any seasoned news user
will want something more complex.
