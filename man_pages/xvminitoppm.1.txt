       xvminitoppm

       [xvminipic]

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       xvminittoppm  reads an XV "thumbnail" picture (a miniature picture gen‐
       erated by the "VisualSchnauzer" browser) as input and  produces  a  PPM
       image as output.

OPTIONS
       There are no command line options defined specifically for xvminitoppm,
       but it recognizes the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm
       (See
        Common Options ⟨index.html#commonoptions⟩ .)

HISTORY
       A  program of this name was written in 1993 by Ingo Wilken and was part
       of Netpbm until Release 10.34 (April 2006).  At that time, it  was  re‐
       placed  in  Netpbm  by  the current program, which was written by Bryan
       Henderson.  The function of the newer program is identical to  that  of
       the  older one; the reason for the replacement is that the newer one is
       easier to maintain.
