NAME

menufile -
entry in the Debian menu system

SYNOPSIS

~/.menu/*

/etc/menu/*

/usr/lib/menu/*

/usr/share/menu/*

/usr/share/menu/default/*

DESCRIPTION

Menu files add
entries to the Debian menu system. The system administrator
can place menu files in /etc/menu/ to override menu files
that packages add to /usr/share/menu/ . The user can place
menu files in ~/.menu/ to override all other menu files.

Please read the
Debian menu manual available in /usr/share/doc/menu/html for
the complete specification of menu files.

The menu files
are usually named after the Debian package that contains the
programs listed in them. In it, you can list several
"menu entries" that specify a specific item in the
menu structure. Each menu entry specifies which packages it
depends on; if that package are not installed, the menu
entry will be ignored by update-menus(1). (In a menu
entry you can specify pseudo-packages that start with
"local."; update-menus will always use those menu
entries). If you wish to remove an item from the menu
entirely, make an empty menu file with the same name as the
file you want to override.

Examples

Dosemu could
install the following menu file as
/usr/share/menu/dosemu:

?package(dosemu):needs="text"
section="Applications/Emulators"
title="Dosemu" command="dosemu" 
?package(dosemu):needs="X11"
section="Applications/Emulators"
title="Dosemu" command="xdos"

The system
administrator wants to override this file to change how
dosemu is run, so /etc/menu/dosemu is created:

?package(dosemu):needs="text"
section="Applications/Emulators"
title="Dosemu" command="dosemu -A" 
?package(dosemu):needs="X11"
section="Applications/Emulators"
title="Dosemu" command="xdos -A"

A user does not
want Dosemu to appear in the menus at all, so the user
creates an empty file named ~/.menu/dosemu.

FORMAT

A menu file
consists of 0 or more lines of the following format:

?package(package-name):var1=value1
var2=value2 ...

needs

Specify what kind of environment the program require.
This variable must be defined, and should be one of the
following: 

needs="text"

Program requires a terminal

needs="x11"

Program requires a X server

needs="vc"

Program requires a Linux
console (i.e.: svgalib programs)

needs="wm"

The program is a window
manager.

needs="fvwmmodule"

The program is a fvwm
compatible module.

section

The section in which the menu
entry should appear. See MENU LAYOUT for preferred
section names.

icon

An icon for this menu entry. If no icon is available,
just don&rsquo;t define this.

title

The title of the program that will appear on the menus.
Keep it short. If two menu entries share the same title and
section, the one that best fits the available display will
be used. So in the example above with two menu entries that
both have the menu id "title", if X is available,
the X11 one will be used; otherwise the text one will be
used. Must be defined.

command

The command to be executed when
this menu entry is selected.

hints

A comma-separated list of hints on how grouping menu
entries; see the manual.

MENU LAYOUT

The
authoritative list of Debian&rsquo;s menu structure
is maintained in the Debian Menu sub-policy document which
is part of the Debian Policy package. The menu structure
below is included only for convenience. Please do not put
your packages into any other sections.

Use
&rsquo;/&rsquo; to separate sub-menu names, for example,
"Applications/Editors" or
"Games/Arcade".

NOTES

If you want to
specify an icon or hotkey for a sub-menu (for example, the
Editors sub-menu), just use the same syntax but leave the
command empty:

?package(mypackage):needs="X11"
section="Applications" \ 
icon="/usr/share/pixmaps/icon.xpm"
hotkey="E" title="Editors"

Whenever any
menu files are changed, you must run
update-menus(1)
