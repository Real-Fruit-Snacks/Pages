NAME

auths &minus;
print authorizations granted to a user

SYNOPSIS

auths
[ user ...]

DESCRIPTION

The
auths command prints on standard output the
authorizations that you or the optionally-specified user or
role have been granted. Authorizations are rights that are
checked by certain privileged programs to determine whether
a user may execute restricted functionality.

Each user may
have zero or more authorizations. Authorizations are
represented by fully-qualified names, which identify the
organization that created the authorization and the
functionality that it controls. Following the Java
convention, the hierarchical components of an authorization
are separated by dots (.), starting with the reverse
order Internet domain name of the creating organization, and
ending with the specific function within a class of
authorizations.

An asterisk
(*) indicates all authorizations in a class.

A user&rsquo;s
authorizations are looked up in user_attr(4) and in
the /etc/security/policy.conf file (see
policy.conf(4)). Authorizations may be specified
directly in user_attr(4) or indirectly through
prof_attr(4). Authorizations may also be assigned to
every user in the system directly as default authorizations
or indirectly as default profiles in the
/etc/security/policy.conf file.
