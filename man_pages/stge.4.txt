STGE(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual STGE(4)

NAME

stge &mdash;
Sundance/Tamarack TC9021 Gigabit Ethernet adapter driver

SYNOPSIS

To compile this driver into the
kernel, place the following lines in your kernel
configuration file:

device
miibus 
device stge

Alternatively,
to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following line in loader.conf(5):

if_stge_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION

The stge device driver
provides support for various NICs based on the
Sundance/Tamarack TC9021 Gigabit Ethernet controller
chip.

The
Sundance/Tamarack TC9021 is found on the D-Link DGE-550T and
the Antares Microsystems Gigabit Ethernet board. It uses an
external PHY or an external 10-bit interface.

All NICs
supported by the stge driver have TCP/UDP/IP checksum
offload for both receive and transmit, hardware VLAN tag
stripping/insertion features, and receive interrupt
moderation mechanism as well as a 64-bit multicast hash
filter. The Sundance/Tamarack TC9021 supports TBI (ten bit
interface) and GMII transceivers, which means it can be used
with either copper or 1000baseX fiber applications.

The
Sundance/Tamarack TC9021 also supports jumbo frames, which
can be configured via the interface MTU setting. Selecting
an MTU larger than 1500 bytes with the ifconfig(8) utility
configures the adapter to receive and transmit jumbo
frames.

The stge
driver supports the following media types:

autoselect

Enable
autoselection of the media type and options. The user can
manually override the autoselected mode by adding media
options to rc.conf(5).

10baseT/UTP

Set 10Mbps
operation. The ifconfig(8) mediaopt option can also
be used to select either full-duplex or
half-duplex modes.

100baseTX

Set 100Mbps
(Fast Ethernet) operation. The ifconfig(8) mediaopt
option can also be used to select either full-duplex
or half-duplex modes.

1000baseTX

Set 1000baseTX
operation over twisted pair. The Sundance/Tamarack supports
1000Mbps in autoselect mode only.

The stge
driver supports the following media options:

full-duplex

Force full
duplex operation.

half-duplex

Force half
duplex operation.

For more
information on configuring this device, see ifconfig(8).

SYSCTL VARIABLES

The following variables are
available as both sysctl(8) variables and loader(8)
tunables:

dev.stge.%d.rxint_nframe

Number of frames between
RxDMAComplete interrupts. The accepted range is 1 to 255,
default value is 8 frames. The interface has to be brought
down and up again before a change takes effect.

dev.stge.%d.rxint_dmawait

Maximum amount of time to wait
in 1us increments before issuing an Rx interrupt if the
number of frames received is less than rxint_nframe.
The accepted range is 0 to 4194, default value is 30
microseconds. The interface has to be brought down and up
again before a change takes effect.
