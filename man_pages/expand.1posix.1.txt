EXPAND(1POSIX)             POSIX Programmer's Manual            EXPAND(1POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       expand — convert tabs to spaces

SYNOPSIS
       expand [-t tablist] [file...]

DESCRIPTION
       The expand utility shall write files or the standard input to the stan‐
       dard  output  with  <tab>  characters replaced with one or more <space>
       characters needed to pad to the next tab stop. Any <backspace>  charac‐
       ters  shall be copied to the output and cause the column position count
       for tab stop calculations to be decremented; the column position  count
       shall not be decremented below zero.

OPTIONS
       The  expand  utility  shall  conform  to the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines.

       The following option shall be supported:

       -t tablist
                 Specify the tab stops. The application shall ensure that  the
                 argument tablist consists of either a single positive decimal
                 integer or a list of tabstops. If a single number  is  given,
                 tabs  shall  be set that number of column positions apart in‐
                 stead of the default 8.

                 If a list of tabstops is given, the application shall  ensure
                 that  it  consists  of a list of two or more positive decimal
                 integers, separated by <blank> or <comma> characters, in  as‐
                 cending  order.  The  <tab>  characters shall be set at those
                 specific column positions. Each tab stop N shall be an  inte‐
                 ger  value greater than zero, and the list is in strictly as‐
                 cending order. This is taken to mean that, from the start  of
                 a  line of output, tabbing to position N shall cause the next
                 character output to be in the (N+1)th column position on that
                 line.

                 In  the  event of expand having to process a <tab> at a posi‐
                 tion beyond the last of those specified in  a  multiple  tab-
                 stop list, the <tab> shall be replaced by a single <space> in
                 the output.

OPERANDS
       The following operand shall be supported:

       file      The pathname of a text file to be used as input.

STDIN
       See the INPUT FILES section.

INPUT FILES
       Input files shall be text files.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution  of  ex‐
       pand:

       LANG      Provide  a  default  value for the internationalization vari‐
                 ables that are unset or null. (See the Base Definitions  vol‐
                 ume  of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 8.2, Internationalization Vari‐
                 ables for the precedence  of  internationalization  variables
                 used to determine the values of locale categories.)

       LC_ALL    If  set  to  a non-empty string value, override the values of
                 all the other internationalization variables.

       LC_CTYPE  Determine the locale for the interpretation of  sequences  of
                 bytes of text data as characters (for example, single-byte as
                 opposed to  multi-byte  characters  in  arguments  and  input
                 files),  the  processing of <tab> and <space> characters, and
                 for the determination of the width in column  positions  each
                 character would occupy on an output device.

       LC_MESSAGES
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format
                 and contents of diagnostic messages written to  standard  er‐
                 ror.

       NLSPATH   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing
                 of LC_MESSAGES.

ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
       Default.

STDOUT
       The standard output shall be equivalent to the input files  with  <tab>
       characters converted into the appropriate number of <space> characters.

STDERR
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

OUTPUT FILES
       None.

EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
       None.

EXIT STATUS
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Successful completion

       >0    An error occurred.

CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
       The  expand  utility shall terminate with an error message and non-zero
       exit status upon encountering difficulties accessing one  of  the  file
       operands.

       The following sections are informative.

APPLICATION USAGE
       None.

EXAMPLES
       None.

RATIONALE
       The expand utility is useful for preprocessing text files (before sort‐
       ing, looking at specific columns, and so on) that contain <tab> charac‐
       ters.

       See  the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 3.103, Column
       Position.

       The tablist option-argument consists of integers  in  ascending  order.
       Utility  Syntax Guideline 8 mandates that expand shall accept the inte‐
       gers (within the single argument) separated  using  either  <comma>  or
       <blank> characters.

       Earlier  versions  of  this  standard allowed the following form in the
       SYNOPSIS:

           expand [-tabstop][-tab1,tab2,...,tabn][file ...]

       This form is no longer specified by POSIX.1‐2008 but may be present  in
       some implementations.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
