stWriteTime - date and time handling

SYNOPSIS

#include

#include 

time_tstMktime
(char *string);

char*stWriteTime
(time_t date);

DESCRIPTION

stMktime
scans the given string and tries to read a date and
time from it. It understands various formats of date
strings. The following is a list of all valid formats,
optional parts in brackets. 
[Tue] Jan 5[,] [19]93

This includes the standard
asctime(3) format.

Jan 5

With no year given, the year defaults to the current
year. 

[19]93/01/05

This notation requires month and day represented by
exactly two digits.

5.1.[19]93

This is the usual German notation.

5.1.

German notation referencing the current year.

A certain time,
given together with the date must always have the following
form. 
hours:minutes[:seconds]

Each of the fields must be an
integer value within the proper range (hours: 0-23, minutes
and seconds: 0-59). Values below 10 may be written as one
digit numbers.

The time value
may be placed anywhere in the date string: at the beginning,
at the end, or somewhere in the middle. Any amount of
whitespace may be given between a field of the time value
and the separating colon. The time is always considered to
be local time.

stWriteTime
generates a time string similar to asctime(3) from its
date argument.

BUGS

Time Zone Names
within the time string (like &rsquo;MET&rsquo;) are not
handled properly. In most cases they will cause a
failure.
