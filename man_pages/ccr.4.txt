CCR(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual CCR(4)

NAME

ccr &mdash; Chelsio T6
crypto accelerator driver

SYNOPSIS

To compile this driver into the
kernel, place the following lines in your kernel
configuration file:

device
ccr

To load the
driver as a module at boot time, place the following line in
loader.conf(5):

ccr_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION

The ccr driver provides
support for the crypto accelerator engine included on PCI
Express Ethernet adapters based on the Chelsio Terminator 6
ASIC (T6). The driver accelerates AES-CBC, AES-CTR, AES-GCM,
AES-XTS, SHA1-HMAC, SHA2-256-HMAC, SHA2-384-HMAC, and
SHA2-512-HMAC operations for crypto(4) and ipsec(4). The
driver also supports chaining one of AES-CBC, AES-CTR, or
AES-XTS with SHA1-HMAC, SHA2-256-HMAC, SHA2-384-HMAC, or
SHA2-512-HMAC for encrypt-then-authenticate operations. For
further hardware information and questions related to
hardware requirements, see
http://www.chelsio.com/.

The ccr
driver attaches as a child of an existing Chelsio NIC device
and thus requires that the cxgbe(4) driver be active.

HARDWARE

The ccr driver supports
the crypto accelerator engine included on adapters based on
the T6 ASIC:
