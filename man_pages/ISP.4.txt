ISP(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual ISP(4)

NAME

isp — Qlogic based
SPI and FibreChannel SCSI Host Adapters

SYNOPSIS

To compile this driver into the
kernel, place the following lines in your kernel
configuration file:

device scbus

device isp 
device ispfw

Alternatively,
to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following lines in loader.conf(5):

isp_load="YES"

ispfw_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION

This driver provides access to
SPI or FibreChannel SCSI devices.

SPI supports
initiator mode for Ultra SCSI and wide mode transactions for
SCSI, Ultra2 LVD (1080, 1280), and Ultra3 LVD (10160,
12160).

Fibre Channel
supports initiator and target modes of FCP SCSI profile,
utilizing Class 3 and Class 2 (2200 and later) connections.
Support is available for Public and Private loops,
Point-to-Point and Fabric connections.

FC-Tape is
supported on 4Gb (2400) and newer controllers. FC-Tape is
highly recommended for connections to tape drives that
support it. It encompasses four elements from the T-10 FCP-4
specification:

•

Precise Delivery of
Commands

•

Confirmed Completion of FCP I/O
Operations

•

Retransmission of
Unsuccessfully Transmitted IUs

•

Task Retry Identification

Together these
features allow for link level error recovery with tape
devices. Without it, an initiator cannot, for instance, tell
whether a tape write command that has timed out resulted in
all, part or none of the data going to the tape drive.
FC-Tape is automatically enabled when connecting controller
that supports it to a target that supports it. It may be
disabled using configuration and hint options described
below.

FIRMWARE

Firmware loading is supported if
the ispfw(4) module is loaded. It is strongly recommended
that you use the firmware available from ispfw(4) as it is
the most likely to have been tested with this driver.

CONFIGURATION OPTIONS

Target mode support for Fibre
Channel adapters may be enabled with the

options
ISP_TARGET_MODE

option.

To disable
FC-Tape, use the following configuration option:

options
ISP_FCTAPE_OFF

Note that even
if the ISP_FCTAPE_OFF option is used, it may be overridden
by the fctape hint described below.

BOOT OPTIONS

The following options are
switchable by setting values in
/boot/device.hints.

They are:

hint.isp.0.fwload_disable

A hint value to disable loading
of firmware ispfw(4).

hint.isp.0.ignore_nvram

A hint value to ignore board
NVRAM settings for. Otherwise use NVRAM settings.

hint.isp.0.fullduplex

A hint value to set full duplex
mode.

hint.isp.0.topology

A hint value to select topology
of connection. Supported values are:

lport

Prefer loopback
and fallback to point to point.

nport

Prefer point to
point and fallback to loopback.

lport-only

Loopback
only.

nport-only

Point to point
only.

hint.isp.0.portwwn

This should be the full 64 bit
World Wide Port Name you would like to use, overriding the
value in NVRAM for the card.

hint.isp.0.nodewwn

This should be the full 64 bit
World Wide Node Name you would like to use, overriding the
value in NVRAM for the card.

hint.isp.0.iid

A hint to override or set the
Initiator ID or Loop ID. For Fibre Channel cards in Local
Loop topologies it is strongly recommended that you
set this value to non-zero.

hint.isp.0.role

A hint to define default role
for isp instance (0 -- none, 1 -- target, 2 -- initiator, 3
-- both).

hint.isp.0.debug

A hint value for a driver debug
level (see the file /usr/src/sys/dev/isp/ispvar.h for
the values.

hint.isp.0.vports

A hint to create specified
number of additional virtual ports.

hint.isp.0.nofctape

Set this to 1 to disable
FC-Tape operation on the given isp instance.

hint.isp.0.fctape

Set this to 1 to enable FC-Tape
operation on the given isp instance for targets that support
it.

SYSCTL OPTIONS 
dev.isp.N.loop_down_limit

This value says how long to
wait in seconds after loop has gone down before giving up
and expiring all of the devices that were visible. The
default is 300 seconds (5 minutes). A separate
(nonadjustable) timeout is used when booting to not stop
booting on lack of FC connectivity.

dev.isp.N.gone_device_time

This value says how long to
wait for devices to reappear if they (temporarily) disappear
due to loop or fabric events. While this timeout is running,
I/O to those devices will simply be held.

dev.isp.N.use_gff_id

dev.isp.N.use_gft_id

Setting those options to 0
allows to disable use of GFF_ID and GFT_ID SNS requests
during FC fabric scan. It may be useful if switch does not
implement them correctly, preventing some devices from being
found. Disabling them may cause unneeded logins to ports not
supporting target role or even FCP at all. The default is 1
(enabled).

dev.isp.N.wwnn

This is the readonly World Wide
Node Name value for this port.

dev.isp.N.wwpn

This is the readonly World Wide
Port Name value for this port.

AUTHORS

The isp driver was
written by Matthew Jacob originally for NetBSD at NASA/Ames
Research Center. Later improvement was done by 
Alexander Motin mav [AT] FreeBSD.org>.

BUGS

The driver currently ignores
some NVRAM settings.

Fabric support
for 2100 cards has been so problematic, and these cards are
so old now that it is just not worth your time to try
it.
