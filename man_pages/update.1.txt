DESCRIPTION

Interchange&rsquo;s
"update" is a rudimentary method of
directly setting the DBM files (not the
ASCII files) of a Interchange
DBM database.

NOTE:
This command DOES NOT APPLY TO SQL databases.
They have their own command line monitors that are more
flexible.

OPTIONS

&minus;c
name

Sets the catalog for which
"update" operates. It reads the
catalog.cfg file to retrieve database settings.

&minus;f field

The name of the field to
set.

&minus;n name

The name of the table to set.
If the table is not a DBM database the
"update" program will terminate with an
error.
