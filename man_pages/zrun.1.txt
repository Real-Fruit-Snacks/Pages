NAME

zrun -
automatically uncompress arguments to command

SYNOPSIS

zrun command
file.gz [...]

DESCRIPTION

Prefixing a
shell command with "zrun" causes any compressed
files that are arguments of the command to be transparently
uncompressed to temp files (not pipes) and the uncompressed
files fed to the command.

This is a quick
way to run a command that does not itself support compressed
files, without manually uncompressing the files.

The following
compression types are supported: gz bz2 Z xz lzma lzo

If zrun is
linked to some name beginning with z, like zprog, and the
link is executed, this is equivalent to executing "zrun
prog".

BUGS

Modifications
to the uncompressed temporary file are not fed back into the
input file, so using this as a quick way to make an editor
support compressed files won’t work.
