lat_fcntl -
fcntl file locking benchmark

SYNOPSIS

lat_ctx
[ -P  ] [ -W
 ] [ -N  ]

DESCRIPTION

lat_fcntl
is a client/server program that measures file locking
latencies. The benchmark alternately locks and unlocks files
so that only one of the client or server is running at a
time, similar to ’’hot potato’’
message passing benchmarks. No other work is done in the
processes.

Funding for the
development of this tool was provided by Sun Microsystems
Computer Corporation.
