XPT(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual XPT(4)

NAME

xpt &mdash; CAM transport
layer interface

SYNOPSIS

None.

DESCRIPTION

The xpt driver provides a
way for userland applications to issue certain CAM CCBs to
the kernel.

Since the
xpt driver allows direct access to the CAM subsystem,
system administrators should exercise caution when granting
access to this driver. If used improperly, this driver can
allow userland applications to crash a machine or cause data
loss.

KERNEL CONFIGURATION

There is no kernel configuration
required for the xpt driver. It is enabled when SCSI
support is enabled in the kernel. There is one instance of
the xpt driver per CAM transport layer instance. Since there
is currently only one CAM transport layer, there will only
be one instance of this driver.

IOCTLS 
CAMIOCOMMAND

This ioctl
takes certain kinds of CAM CCBs and passes them through to
the CAM transport layer for action. Only the following CCB
types are supported:

XPT_SCAN_BUS 
XPT_RESET_BUS 
XPT_SCAN_LUN 
XPT_ENG_INQ 
XPT_ENG_EXEC 
XPT_DEBUG 
XPT_DEV_MATCH 
XPT_PATH_INQ

The above CCBs are the only
ones supported since it makes more sense to send them
through a generic passthrough device rather than a
passthrough device tied to a particular underlying SCSI
device.

CAMGETPASSTHRU

This ioctl
takes an XPT_GDEVLIST CCB, and returns the passthrough
device corresponding to the device in question.

FILES 
/dev/xpt0

Character
device node for the xpt driver.

DIAGNOSTICS

None.
