NAME

pflogd &mdash; packet
filter logging daemon

SYNOPSIS

pflogd
[&minus;DragonFly]
[&minus;d delay]
[&minus;f filename]
[&minus;s snaplen]
[expression]

DESCRIPTION

pflogd is a background
daemon which reads packets logged by pf(4) to the packet
logging interface pflog0 and writes the packets to a
logfile (normally /var/log/pflog) in tcpdump(8)
binary format. These logs can be reviewed later using the
&minus;r option of tcpdump(8), hopefully offline in
case there are bugs in the packet parsing code of
tcpdump(8).

pflogd
closes and then re-opens the log file when it receives
SIGHUP, permitting newsyslog(8) to rotate logfiles
automatically. SIGALRM causes pflogd to flush the
current logfile buffers to the disk, thus making the most
recent logs available. The buffers are also flushed every
delay seconds.

If the log file
contains data after a restart or a SIGHUP, new logs are
appended to the existing file. If the existing log file was
created with a different snaplen, pflogd temporarily
uses the old snaplen to keep the log file consistent.

pflogd
tries to preserve the integrity of the log file against I/O
errors. Furthermore, integrity of an existing log file is
verified before appending. If there is an invalid log file
or an I/O error, logging is suspended until a SIGHUP or a
SIGALRM is received.

The options are
as follows:

&minus;D

Debugging mode.
pflogd does not disassociate from the controlling
terminal.

&minus;d delay

Time in seconds to delay
between automatic flushes of the file. This may be specified
with a value between 5 and 3600 seconds. If not specified,
the default is 60 seconds.

&minus;f
filename

Log output filename. Default is
/var/log/pflog.

&minus;s
snaplen

Analyze at most the first
snaplen bytes of data from each packet rather than
the default of 96. The default of 96 is adequate for IP,
ICMP, TCP, and UDP headers but may truncate protocol
information for other protocols. Other file parsers may
desire a higher snaplen.

&minus;x

Check the
integrity of an existing log file, and return.

expression

Selects which packets will be
dumped, using the regular language of tcpdump(8).

FILES 
/var/run/pflogd.pid

Process ID of
the currently running pflogd.

/var/log/pflog

Default log
file.

EXAMPLES

Log specific tcp packets to a
different log file with a large snaplen (useful with a
log-all rule to dump complete sessions):

# pflogd -s
1600 -f suspicious.log port 80 and host evilhost

Display binary
logs:

# tcpdump -n -e
-ttt -r /var/log/pflog

Display the logs
in real time (this does not interfere with the operation of
pflogd):

# tcpdump -n -e
-ttt -i pflog0

Tcpdump has been
extended to be able to filter on the pfloghdr structure
defined in &lang; net/if_pflog.h&rang; . Tcpdump can
restrict the output to packets logged on a specified
interface, a rule number, a reason, a direction, an IP
family or an action.

ip

Address family
equals IPv4.

ip6

Address family
equals IPv6.

ifname kue0

Interface name
equals "kue0".

on kue0

Interface name
equals "kue0".

rulenum 10

Rule number
equals 10.

reason match

Reason equals
match. Also accepts "bad-offset",
"fragment", "short",
"normalize" and "memory".

action pass

Action equals
pass. Also accepts "block".

inbound

The direction
was inbound.

outbound

The direction
was outbound.

Display the logs
in real time of inbound packets that were blocked on the wi0
interface:

# tcpdump -n -e
-ttt -i pflog0 inbound and action block and on wi0
