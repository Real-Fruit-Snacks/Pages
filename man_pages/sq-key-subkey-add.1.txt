NAME

sq key subkey
add - Add a newly generated Subkey

SYNOPSIS

sq key
subkey add [OPTIONS] FILE

DESCRIPTION

Add a newly
generated Subkey.

A subkey has
one or more flags. &rsquo;--can-sign&rsquo; sets the signing
flag, and means that the key may be used for signing.
&rsquo;--can-authenticate&rsquo; sets the authentication
flags, and means that the key may be used for authentication
(e.g., as an SSH key). These two flags may be combined.

&rsquo;--can-encrypt=storage&rsquo;
sets the storage encryption flag, and means that the key may
be used for storage encryption.
&rsquo;--can-encrypt=transport&rsquo; sets the transport
encryption flag, and means that the key may be used for
transport encryption. &rsquo;--can-encrypt=universal&rsquo;
sets both the storage and the transport encryption flag, and
means that the key may be used for both storage and
transport encryption. Only one of the encryption flags may
be used and it can not be combined with the signing or
authentication flag.

At least one
flag must be chosen.

When using
&rsquo;--with-password&rsquo;, &rsquo;sq&rsquo; prompts the
user for a password, that is used to encrypt the subkey. The
password for the subkey may be different from that of the
primary key.

Furthermore the
subkey may use one of several available cipher suites, that
can be selected using &rsquo;--cipher-suite&rsquo;.

By default a
new subkey never expires. However, its validity period is
limited by that of the primary key it is added for. Using
the &rsquo;--expiry&rsquo; argument specific validity
periods may be defined. It allows for providing a point in
time for validity to end or a validity duration.

&rsquo;sq key
subkey add&rsquo; respects the reference time set by the
top-level &rsquo;--time&rsquo; argument. It sets the
creation time of the subkey to the specified time.

OPTIONS

Subcommand
options 
-B, --binary

Emit binary data

-c,
--cipher-suite=CIPHER-SUITE

Select the cryptographic
algorithms for the subkey

--can-authenticate

Add authentication capability
to subkey

--can-encrypt=PURPOSE

Add an encryption capability to
subkey. Encryption-capable subkeys can be marked as suitable
for transport encryption, storage encryption, or both, i.e.,
universal. [default: universal]

--can-sign

Add signing capability to
subkey

--expiry=EXPIRY

Define EXPIRY for the subkey as
ISO 8601 formatted string or custom duration. If an ISO 8601
formatted string is provided, the validity period reaches
from the reference time (may be set using
&rsquo;--time&rsquo;) to the provided time. Custom durations
starting from the reference time may be set using
&rsquo;N[ymwds]&rsquo;, for N years, months, weeks, days, or
seconds. The special keyword &rsquo;never&rsquo; sets an
unlimited expiry.

-o,
--output=FILE

Write to FILE or stdout if
omitted

--private-key-store=KEY_STORE

Provide parameters for private
key store

--with-password

Protect the subkey with a
password

FILE

Read from FILE or stdin if omitted

Global
options 
See sq(1) for a description of the global
options.

EXAMPLES

First, generate
a key

sq key generate
--userid &rsquo;juliet [AT] example.org>&rsquo; \

--output juliet.key.pgp

Add a new
Subkey for universal encryption which expires at the same
time as the primary key

sq key subkey
add --output juliet-new.key.pgp \

--can-encrypt universal
juliet.key.pgp

Add a new
Subkey for signing using the rsa3k cipher suite which
expires in five days

sq key subkey
add --output juliet-new.key.pgp --can-sign \

--expiry 5d --cipher-suite
rsa3k juliet.key.pgp
