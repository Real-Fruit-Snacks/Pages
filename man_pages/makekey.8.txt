encrypted keys or passwords

SYNOPSIS

makekey

DESCRIPTION

The makekey
utility has been deprecated and will be removed in a
future release of FreeBSD.

The
makekey utility encrypts a key and salt which it
reads from the standard input and writes the result to the
standard output. The key is expected to be eight bytes; the
salt is expected to be two bytes. See crypt(3) for more
information on what characters the key and salt can contain
and how the encrypted value is calculated.
