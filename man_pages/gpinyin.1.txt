Description

gpinyin
is a preprocessor for groff(1) that facilitates use
of Hanyu Pinyin in groff(7) files. Pinyin is a method
for writing the Mandarin Chinese language with the Latin
alphabet. Mandarin consists of more than four hundred base
syllables, each spoken with one of five different tones.
Changing the tone applied to the syllable generally alters
the meaning of the word it forms. In Pinyin, a syllable is
written in the Latin alphabet and a numeric tone indicator
can be appended to each syllable.

Each
input-file is a file name or the character
“-” to indicate that the standard input
stream should be read. As usual, the argument
“--” can be used in order to force
interpretation of all remaining arguments as file names,
even if an input-file argument begins with a
“-”. -h and --help display
a usage message, while -v and --version show
version information; all exit afterward.

Pinyin
sections 
Pinyin sections in groff files are enclosed by two
.pinyin requests with different arguments. The
starting request is

.pinyin start

or

.pinyin begin

and the ending request is

.pinyin stop

or

.pinyin end

.

Syllables

In Pinyin, each syllable is represented by one to six
letters drawn from the fifty-two upper- and lowercase
letters of the Unicode basic Latin character set, plus the
letter “U” with dieresis (umlaut) in both
cases—in other words, the members of the set
“[a–zA–ZüÜ]”.

In groff
input, all basic Latin letters are written as themselves.
The “u with dieresis” can be written as
“\[:u]” in lowercase or “\[:U]” in
uppercase. Within .pinyin sections, gpinyin
supports the form “ue” for lowercase and the
forms “Ue” and “UE” for
uppercase.

Tones

Each syllable has exactly one of five tones. The
fifth tone is not explicitly written at all, but each of the
first through fourth tones is indicated with a diacritic
above a specific vowel within the syllable.

In a
gpinyin source file, these tones are written by
adding a numeral in the range 0 to 5 after the syllable. The
tone numbers 1 to 4 are transformed into accents above
vowels in the output. The tone numbers 0 and 5 are
synonymous.

[The tone mark
table is omitted from this rendering of the man page because
the selected output device “html” lacks the
character repertoire to display it. Try another output
device.]

The neutral
tone number can be omitted from a word-final syllable, but
not otherwise.
