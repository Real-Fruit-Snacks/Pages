NAME
       Glib::Param::Int - Paramspecs for integer types

HIERARCHY
         Glib::ParamSpec
         +----Glib::Param::Int

         Glib::ParamSpec
         +----Glib::Param::Char

         Glib::ParamSpec
         +----Glib::Param::Long

DESCRIPTION
       This page documents the extra accessors available for all of the
       integer type paramspecs: Char, Int, and Long.  Perl really only
       supports full-size integers, so all of these methods return IVs; the
       distinction of integer size is important to the underlying C library
       and also determines the data value range.

METHODS
   integer = $pspec->get_maximum
   integer = $pspec->get_minimum
