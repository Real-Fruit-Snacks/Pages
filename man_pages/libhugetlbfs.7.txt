NAME

libhugetlbfs -
preload library to back text, data, malloc() or shared
memory with hugepages

SYNOPSIS

export
[environment options] 
[LD_PRELOAD=libhugetlbfs.so] target_application

DESCRIPTION

libhugetlbfs
is a library that can back application text, data, malloc()
and shared memory with hugepages. This is of benefit to
applications that use large amounts of address space and
suffer a performance hit due to TLB misses. Wall-clock time
or oprofile can be used to determine if there is a
performance benefit from using libhugetlbfs or not.
In all cases but shared memory, a hugetlbfs mount must exist
and a hugepage pool defined for hugepages to be used.

Some limited
functionality is available for unmodified dynamically linked
applications. By preloading the library, the library can
back malloc() and shared memory, and text and data segments
can be partially backed if they are large enough.

For the
effective backing of text and data with huge pages, the
application must be linked to the library and the ELF
segments correctly aligned using the ld helpers. Once
linked, malloc or shared memory can still be backed but no
pre-loading is required. See
/usr/share/doc/libhugetlbfs/HOWTO and ld.hugetlbfs(1) for
detailed instructions on relinking applications.

For
applications that are hugepage-aware and linked to the
library get_huge_pages() can be used for the direct
allocation of hugepage-backed regions.

Unless
otherwise specified, libhugetlbfs will use the
default hugepage size to back memory regions. The default
size is the value of Hugepagesize displayed in
/proc/meminfo. The size can be specified in bytes or in
kilobytes, megabytes, or gigabytes by appending K, M, or G
respectively. It is an error to specify a invalid,
unsupported, or otherwise unconfigured huge page size.
Kernel 2.6.27 or later is required to specify any pagesize
other than the default.

See
/usr/share/docs/libhugetlbfs/HOWTO for detailed instructions
on how the library should be used, particularly when
relinking the application. This manual page provides a brief
synopsis of the environment variables as a quick
reference.

The following
variables affect what memory regions are backed by
hugepages. In all cases, the environment being unset implies
the feature should remain disabled. 
HUGETLB_DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE=

This sets the default hugepage
size to be used by libhugetlbfs. If not set, libhugetlbfs
will use the kernel’s default hugepage size.

HUGETLB_MORECORE=[yes|]

This enables the hugepage
malloc() feature, instructing libhugetlbfs to override
glibc’s normal morecore() function with a hugepage
version and use it for malloc(). All application malloc()
memory should come from hugepage memory until it runs out,
it will then fallback to base pages. Note that applications
that use custom allocators may not be able to back their
heaps using hugepages and this environment variable. It may
be necessary to modify the custom allocator to use
get_huge_pages().

HUGETLB_SHM=yes

When this environment variable
is set, the SHM_HUGETLB flag is added to the shmget() call
and the size parameter is aligned to back the shared memory
segment with hugepages. In the event hugepages cannot be
used, base pages will be used instead and a warning will be
printed to explain the failure. The pagesize cannot be
specified with this parameter. To change the kernels default
hugepage size, use the pagesize= kernel boot parameter
(2.6.26 or later required).

HUGETLB_ELFMAP=[no|[R[]:[W[]]]

If the application has been
relinked (see the HOWTO for instructions), this environment
variable determines whether read-only, read-write, both or
no segments are backed by hugepages and what pagesize should
be used. If the recommended relinking method has been used,
then hugeedit can be used to automatically back the
text or data by default.

HUGETLB_FORCE_ELFMAP=yes

Force the use of hugepages for
text and data segments even if the application has not been
relinked to align the ELF segments on a hugepage boundary.
Partial segment remapping is not guaranteed to work and the
segments must be large enough to contain at least one
hugepage for the remapping to occur.

The following
options affect how libhugetlbfs behaves. 
HUGETLB_RESTRICT_EXE=e1:e2:...:eN

By default, libhugetlbfs will
act on any program that it is loaded with, either via
LD_PRELOAD or by explicitly linking with -lhugetlbfs.

There are situations in which it is desirable to
restrict libhugetlbfs’ actions to specific programs.
For example, some ISV applications are wrapped in a series
of scripts that invoke bash, python, and/or perl.

It is more convenient to set the environment variables
related to libhugetlbfs before invoking the wrapper scripts,
yet this has the unintended and undesirable consequence of
causing the script interpreters to use and consume
hugepages. There is no obvious benefit to causing the script
interpreters to use hugepages, and there is a clear
disadvantage: fewer hugepages are available to the actual
application. 

To address this
scenario, set HUGETLB_RESTRICT_EXE to a colon-separated list
of programs to which the other libhugetlbfs environment
variables should apply. (If not set, libhugetlbfs will
attempt to apply the requested actions to all programs.) For
example,

HUGETLB_RESTRICT_EXE=hpcc:long_hpcc

will restrict
libhugetlbfs’ actions to programs named
/home/fred/hpcc and /bench/long_hpcc but not
/bin/hpcc_no.

HUGETLB_MORECORE_SHRINK=yes

By default, the hugepage heap
does not shrink. Shrinking is enabled by setting this
environment variable. It is disabled by default as glibc
occasionally exhibits strange behaviour if it mistakes the
heap returned by libhugetlbfs as a foreign brk().

HUGETLB_NO_PREFAULT

By default libhugetlbfs
will prefault regions it creates to ensure they can be
referenced without receiving a SIGKILL. On kernels older
than 2.6.27, this was necessary as the system did not
guarantee that future faults would succeed on regions mapped
MAP_PRIVATE. Prefaulting impacts the performance of malloc()
and can result in poor placement on NUMA systems. If it is
known the hugepage pool is large enough to run the
application or the kernel is 2.6.27 or later, this
environment variable should be set.

HUGETLB_NO_RESERVE=yes

By default, the
kernel will reserve huge pages at mmap() time to ensure that
future faults will succeed. This avoids unexpected
application failure at fault time but some applications
depend on memory overcommit to create large sparse mappings.
For this type of application, setting this environment
variable will create huge page backed mappings without a
reservation. Use this option with extreme care as in the
event huge pages are not available when the mapping is used,
the application will be killed. On older kernels, the use of
this feature can trigger the OOM killer. Hence, even with
this variable set, reservations may still be used for
safety.

HUGETLB_MORECORE_HEAPBASE=address

libhugetlbfs normally
picks an address to use as the base of the heap for malloc()
automatically. This environment variable fixes which address
is used.

HUGETLB_PATH=

The path to the hugetlbfs mount
is automatically determined at run-time. In the event there
are multiple mounts and the wrong one is being selected, use
this option to select the correct one. This may be the case
if an application-specific mount with a fixed quota has been
created for example.

HUGETLB_SHARE=1

By default, libhugetlbfs
uses unlinked hugetlbfs files to store remapped program
segment data. If the same program is started multiple times
using hugepage segments, multiple hugepages will be used to
store the same program data. The reduce this wastage,
setting this environment variable will share read-only
segments between multiple invocations of a program at the
cost of the memory being used whether the applications are
running or not. It is also possible that a malicious
application inferfere with other applications executable
code. See the HOWTO for more detailed information on this
topic.

The following
options control the verbosity of libhugetlbfs.

HUGETLB_VERBOSE=

The default value for this is 1
and the range of the value is from 0 to 99. The higher the
value, the more verbose the output is. 0 is quiet and 3 will
output much debugging information.

HUGETLB_DEBUG

Once set, this will give very
detailed output on what is happening in the library and run
extra diagnostics.
