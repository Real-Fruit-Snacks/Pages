NAME

pmlogredact
- remove sensitive information from PCP archives

SYNOPSIS

pmlogredact
[-vx?] [-c config] inarch
[outarch]

DESCRIPTION

Performance
Co-Pilot (PCP) archives may contain a wealth of information
collected from across all components of a system.

Some of this
information may be deemed sensitive outside the context of
the original collection for analysis of system performance.
Examples of sensitive information might include user names,
paths to user home directories (that may imply user names),
hostnames, IP addresses, MAC addresses, command line
arguments, process environment variables, etc.

pmlogredact
may be used to remove sensitive information before archives
are shipped to another organization, or stored in another
geography, or to meet regulatory or privacy compliance. The
output archive outarch is the redacted version of the
input archive inarch.

pmlogredact
is a thin wrapper around pmlogrewrite(1), and so the
configuration files for pmlogredact follow the same
syntax as the configuration files for
pmlogrewrite(1).

There are a
default set of redaction rules in the
$PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmlogredact/* files. These rules
remove some metrics, rewrite the instance domains of some
metrics and rewrite the values of some metrics. The
-x (or --exclude-std) option may be used to
not use the default set of rules.

Additional (or
alternative) configuration files may be specified with one
or more -c (or --config) options, where each
config is either a file or a directory (implying all
the files within that directory).

The -v
(or --verbose) option adds verbosity (and is passed
directly to pmlogrewrite(1)).

The -?
(or --help) option displays a usage message and
exits.

PCP ENVIRONMENT

Environment
variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On
each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains
the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).
