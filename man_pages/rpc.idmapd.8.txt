RPC.IDMAPD(8) BSD System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
RPC.IDMAPD(8)

NAME

rpc.idmapd &mdash; NFSv4
ID  Name Mapper

SYNOPSIS

rpc.idmapd [-h]
[-f] [-v] [-C] [-S]
[-p path]
[-c path]

DESCRIPTION

rpc.idmapd is the NFSv4
ID  name mapping daemon. It provides functionality
to the NFSv4 kernel client and server, to which it
communicates via upcalls, by translating user and group IDs
to names, and vice versa.

The system
derives the user part of the string by performing a
password or group lookup. The lookup mechanism is configured
in /etc/idmapd.conf

By default, the
domain part of the string is the system&rsquo;s DNS
domain name. It can also be specified in
/etc/idmapd.conf if the system is multi-homed, or if
the system&rsquo;s DNS domain name does not match the name
of the system&rsquo;s Kerberos realm.

When the domain
is not specified in /etc/idmapd.conf the local DNS server
will be queried for the _nfsv4idmapdomain text
record. If the record exists that will be used as the
domain. When the record does not exist, the domain part of
the DNS domain will used.

Note that on
more recent kernels only the NFSv4 server uses
rpc.idmapd. The NFSv4 client instead uses
nfsidmap(8), and only falls back to rpc.idmapd if
there was a problem running the nfsidmap(8) program.

The options are
as follows:

-h

Display usage
message.

-v

Increases the
verbosity level (can be specified multiple times).

-f

Runs
rpc.idmapd in the foreground and prints all output to
the terminal.

-p path

Specifies the
location of the RPC pipefs to be path. The default
value is "/var/lib/nfs/rpc_pipefs".

-c path

Use
configuration file path. This option is
deprecated.

-C

Client-only:
perform no idmapping for any NFS server, even if one is
detected.

-S

Server-only:
perform no idmapping for any NFS client, even if one is
detected.

CONFIGURATION FILES

rpc.idmapd recognizes the
following value from the [general] section of the
/etc/nfs.conf configuration file:

pipefs-directory

Equivalent to -p.

All other
settings related to id mapping are found in the
/etc/idmapd.conf configuration file.

EXAMPLES

rpc.idmapd -f -vvv

Runs
rpc.idmapd printing all messages to console, and with
a verbosity level of 3.

FILES

/etc/idmapd.conf,
/etc/nfs.conf
