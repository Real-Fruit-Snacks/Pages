FWOHCI(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual FWOHCI(4)

NAME

fwohci &mdash; OHCI
FireWire chipset device driver

SYNOPSIS

To compile this driver into the
kernel, place the following line in your kernel
configuration file:

device
firewire

Alternatively,
to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following line in loader.conf(5):

firewire_load="YES"

To disable
physical access (see BUGS section for detail), put
the following line in loader.conf(5):

hw.firewire.phydma_enable=0

HISTORY

The fwohci device driver
first appeared in FreeBSD 5.0.

AUTHORS

The fwohci device driver
was written by Katsushi Kobayashi and Hidetoshi
Shimokawa.

BUGS

The driver allows physical
access from any nodes on the bus by default. This means that
any devices on the bus can read and modify any memory space
which can be accessed by an IEEE 1394 OHCI chip. It is
allowed mostly for sbp(4) devices. This should be changed to
allow it only for specific devices. Anyway, FireWire is a
bus and not expected to be connected with un-trustable
devices because a node can monitor all the traffic.
