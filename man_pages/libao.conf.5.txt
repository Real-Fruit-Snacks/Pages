NAME

libao.conf
&minus; configuration for libao.

SYNOPSIS

/etc/libao.conf

~/.libao

DESCRIPTION

libao.conf
and .libao are configuration files for libao, the
audio output library. They specify various options to libao,
as described below. libao.conf sets system-wide
options, whereas ~/.libao sets user-specific options.
When an option is set in both places, the option in
~/.libao takes precedence.

FILE FORMAT

The file
consists of comments and key-value pairs. Comments are on
separate lines that start with a # symbol. The
key-value pairs are of the form:

key=value

where key contains no
whitespace and no equal signs. value will be all of
the text after the equal sign until (but not including) the
ending newline. Beware of extra spaces at the end of the
line! They will probably be interpreted as part of the
option value.

The following
is a list of valid global option keys. Any driver specific
option may be used as well as those keys.

default_driver

The short name of the driver
libao should use by default. Valid values include (not all
are available on every platform): pulse, oss, esd, arts,
alsa, nas, irix, sun, and sndio. Note that "sun"
is used on many BSD systems as well as Solaris.

debug (Value
optional/ignored)

Sets all the drivers as well as
AO itself into debugging output mode. Unlike passing the
debug option to a driver, debug will also print debugging
information from driver loading and testing.

quiet (Value
optional/ignored)

Sets all the drivers as well as
AO itself into silent mode. Errors will return only error
codes; neither ao nor the drivers will print any output
whatsoever to stderr.

verbose (Value
optional/ignored)

Sets all the drivers as well as
AO itself into verbose mode.

EXAMPLE

Here is an
example libao.conf that forces the OSS driver to be
used by default:

# This is a
comment. 
default_driver=oss

BUGS

libao.conf
is missing a number of potentially useful options.
