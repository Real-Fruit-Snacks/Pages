NAME

sd_bus_start -
Initiate a bus connection to the D-bus broker daemon

SYNOPSIS

#include

int
sd_bus_start(sd_bus *bus); 

DESCRIPTION

sd_bus_start()
connects an existing bus connection object to the D-Bus
broker daemon, usually dbus-daemon(1) or
dbus-broker(1). The mechanism to use for the
connection must be configured before the call to
sd_bus_start(), using one of
sd_bus_set_address(3), sd_bus_set_fd(3), or
sd_bus_set_exec(3). sd_bus_start() will open
the connection socket or spawn the executable as needed, and
asynchronously start a org.freedesktop.DBus.Hello()
call. The answer to the Hello call will be processed later
from sd_bus_process(3). If opening of the connection
or queuing of the asynchronous call fail, the connection
will be closed with sd_bus_close(3).

In most cases,
it is better to use sd_bus_default_user(3),
sd_bus_default_system(3) or related calls instead of
the more low-level sd_bus_new() and
sd_bus_start(). The higher-level functions not only
allocate a bus object but also start the connection to a
well-known bus in a single function call.

RETURN VALUE

On success,
this function returns a non-negative integer. On failure, it
returns a negative errno-style error code.

Errors 
-EINVAL

The input parameter bus
is NULL.

Added in
version 246.

-ENOPKG

Bus object bus could not
be resolved.

Added in
version 246.

-EPERM

The input parameter bus
is in a wrong state (sd_bus_start() may only be
called once on a newly-created bus object).

Added in
version 246.

-ECHILD

The bus object bus was
created in a different process.

Added in
version 246.

In addition,
other connection-related errors may be returned. See
sd_bus_send(3).

NOTES

Functions
described here are available as a shared library, which can
be compiled against and linked to with the
libsystemd pkg-config(1) file.

The code
described here uses getenv(3), which is declared to
be not multi-thread-safe. This means that the code calling
the functions described here must not call setenv(3)
from a parallel thread. It is recommended to only do calls
to setenv() from an early phase of the program when
no other threads have been started.

HISTORY

sd_bus_start()
was added in version 246.
