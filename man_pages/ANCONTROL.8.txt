DESCRIPTION

The ancontrol utility
controls the operation of Aironet wireless networking
devices via the an(4) driver. Most of the parameters that
can be changed relate to the IEEE 802.11 protocol which the
Aironet cards implement. This includes such things as the
station name, whether the station is operating in ad-hoc
(point to point) or infrastructure mode, and the network
name of a service set to join. The ancontrol utility
can also be used to view the current NIC status,
configuration and to dump out the values of the card&rsquo;s
statistics counters.

The iface
argument given to ancontrol should be the logical
interface name associated with the Aironet device (an0, an1,
etc.). If one isn&rsquo;t specified the device
&rsquo;&rsquo;an0&rsquo;&rsquo; will be assumed.

The
ancontrol utility is not designed to support the
combination of arguments from different SYNOPSIS
lines in a single ancontrol invocation, and such
combinations are not recommended.

OPTIONS

The options are as follows:

&minus;i iface
&minus;A

Display the preferred access
point list. The AP list can be used by stations to specify
the MAC address of access points with which it wishes to
associate. If no AP list is specified (the default) then the
station will associate with the first access point that it
finds which serves the SSID(s) specified in the SSID list.
The AP list can be modified with the &minus;a
option.

&minus;i iface
&minus;N

Display the SSID list. This is
a list of service set IDs (i.e., network names) with which
the station wishes to associate. There may be up to three
SSIDs in the list: the station will go through the list in
ascending order and associate with the first matching SSID
that it finds.

&minus;i iface
&minus;S

Display NIC status information.
This includes the current operating status, current BSSID,
SSID, channel, beacon period and currently associated access
point. The operating mode indicates the state of the NIC,
MAC status and receiver status. When the "synced"
keyword appears, it means the NIC has successfully
associated with an access point, associated with an ad-hoc
&rsquo;&rsquo;master&rsquo;&rsquo; station, or become a
&rsquo;&rsquo;master&rsquo;&rsquo; itself. The beacon period
can be anything between 20 and 976 milliseconds. The default
is 100.

&minus;i iface
&minus;I

Display NIC capability
information. This shows the device type, frequency, speed
and power level capabilities and firmware revision
levels.

&minus;i iface
&minus;T

Display the NIC&rsquo;s
internal statistics counters.

&minus;i iface
&minus;C

Display current NIC
configuration. This shows the current operation mode,
receive mode, MAC address, power save settings, various
timing settings, channel selection, diversity, transmit
power and transmit speed.

&minus;i iface
&minus;Q

Display the cached signal
strength information maintained by the an(4) driver. The
driver retains information about signal strength and noise
level for packets received from different hosts. The signal
strength and noise level values are displayed in units of
dBms by default. The hw.an.an_cache_mode sysctl(8)
variable can be set to raw, dbm or
per.

&minus;i iface
&minus;Z

Clear the signal strength cache
maintained internally by the an(4) driver.

&minus;i iface
&minus;R

Display RSSI map that converts
from the RSSI index to percent and dBm.

&minus;i iface
&minus;t 0-4

Select transmit speed. The
available settings are as follows:

TX rate

NIC speed

0

Auto -- NIC selects optimal speed

1

1Mbps fixed

2

2Mbps fixed

3

5.5Mbps fixed

4

11Mbps fixed

Note that the
5.5 and 11Mbps settings are only supported on the 4800
series adapters: the 4500 series adapters have a maximum
speed of 2Mbps.

&minus;i iface
&minus;s 0-3

Set power save mode. Valid
selections are as follows:

Selection

Power save mode

0

None - power save disabled

1

Constantly awake mode (CAM)

2

Power Save Polling (PSP)

3

Fast Power Save Polling (PSP-CAM)

Note that for
IBSS (ad-hoc) mode, only PSP mode is supported, and only if
the ATIM window is non-zero.

&minus;i iface [

&minus;v 1-4] &minus;a AP

Set preferred access point. The
AP is specified as a MAC address consisting of 6
hexadecimal values separated by colons. By default, the
&minus;a option only sets the first entry in the AP
list. The &minus;v modifier can be used to specify
exactly which AP list entry is to be modified. If the
&minus;v flag is not used, the first AP list entry
will be changed.

&minus;i iface
&minus;b beacon_period

Set the ad-hoc mode beacon
period. The beacon_period is specified in
milliseconds. The default is 100ms.

&minus;i iface [

&minus;v 0 | 1] &minus;d 0-3

Select the antenna diversity.
Aironet devices can be configured with up to two antennas,
and transmit and receive diversity can be configured
accordingly. Valid selections are as follows:

Selection

Diversity

0

Select factory default diversity

1

Antenna 1 only

2

Antenna 2 only

3

Antenna 1 and 2

The receive and
transmit diversity can be set independently. The user must
specify which diversity setting is to be modified by using
the &minus;v option: selection 0 sets the
receive diversity and 1 sets the transmit
diversity.

&minus;i iface
&minus;e 0-4

Set the transmit WEP key to
use. Note that until this command is issued, the device will
use the last key programmed. The transmit key is stored in
NVRAM. Currently set transmit key can be checked via
&minus;C option. Selection 4 sets the card in
&rsquo;&rsquo;Home Network Mode&rsquo;&rsquo; and uses the
home key.

&minus;i iface [

&minus;v 0-8] &minus;k key

Set a WEP key. For 40 bit
prefix 10 hex character with 0x. For 128 bit prefix 26 hex
character with 0x. Use "" as the key to erase the
key. Supports 4 keys; even numbers are for permanent keys
and odd number are for temporary keys. For example,
&minus;v 1 sets the first temporary key. (A
&rsquo;&rsquo;permanent&rsquo;&rsquo; key is stored in
NVRAM; a &rsquo;&rsquo;temporary&rsquo;&rsquo; key is not.)
Note that the device will use the most recently-programmed
key by default. Currently set keys can be checked via
&minus;C option, only the sizes of the keys are
returned. The value of 8 is for the home key. Note
that the value for the home key can be read back from
firmware.

&minus;i iface
&minus;K 0-2

Set authorization type. Use
0 for none, 1 for
&rsquo;&rsquo;Open&rsquo;&rsquo;, 2 for
&rsquo;&rsquo;Shared Key&rsquo;&rsquo;.

&minus;i iface
&minus;W 0-2

Enable WEP. Use 0 for no
WEP, 1 to enable full WEP, 2 for mixed
cell.

&minus;i iface
&minus;L user_name

Enable LEAP and query for
password. It will check to see if it has authenticated for
up to 60s. To disable LEAP, set WEP mode.

&minus;i iface
&minus;j netjoin_timeout

Set the ad-hoc network join
timeout. When a station is first activated in ad-hoc mode,
it will search out a &rsquo;&rsquo;master&rsquo;&rsquo;
station with the desired SSID and associate with it. If the
station is unable to locate another station with the same
SSID after a suitable timeout, it sets itself up as the
&rsquo;&rsquo;master&rsquo;&rsquo; so that other stations
may associate with it. This timeout defaults to 10000
milliseconds (10 seconds) but may be changed with this
option. The timeout should be specified in milliseconds.

&minus;i iface
&minus;l station_name

Set the station name used
internally by the NIC. The station_name can be any
text string up to 16 characters in length. The default name
is set by the driver to
&rsquo;&rsquo;FreeBSD&rsquo;&rsquo;.

&minus;i iface
&minus;m mac_address

Set the station address for the
specified interface. The mac_address is specified as
a series of six hexadecimal values separated by colons,
e.g.: 00:60:1d:12:34:56. This programs the new address into
the card and updates the interface as well.

&minus;i iface [

&minus;v 1-3] &minus;n SSID

Set the desired SSID (network
name). There are three SSIDs which allows the NIC to work
with access points at several locations without needing to
be reconfigured. The NIC checks each SSID in sequence when
searching for a match. The SSID to be changed can be
specified with the &minus;v modifier option. If the
&minus;v flag isn&rsquo;t used, the first SSID in the
list is set.

&minus;i iface
&minus;o 0 | 1

Set the operating mode of the
Aironet interface. Valid selections are 0 for ad-hoc
mode and 1 for infrastructure mode. The default
driver setting is for infrastructure mode.

&minus;i iface
&minus;p tx_power

Set the transmit power level in
milliwatts. Valid power settings vary depending on the
actual NIC and can be viewed by dumping the device
capabilities with the &minus;I flag. Typical values
are 1, 5, 20, 50 and 100mW. Selecting 0 sets the factory
default.

&minus;i iface
&minus;c frequency

Set the radio frequency of a
given interface. The frequency should be specified as
a channel ID as shown in the table below. The list of
available frequencies is dependent on radio regulations
specified by regional authorities. Recognized regulatory
authorities include the FCC (United States), ETSI (Europe),
France and Japan. Frequencies in the table are specified in
MHz.

If an illegal
channel is specified, the NIC will revert to its default
channel. For NICs sold in the United States and Europe, the
default channel is 3. For NICs sold in France, the default
channel is 11. For NICs sold in Japan, the only available
channel is 14. Note that two stations must be set to the
same channel in order to communicate.

&minus;i iface
&minus;f fragmentation_threshold

Set the fragmentation threshold
in bytes. This threshold controls the point at which
outgoing packets will be split into multiple fragments. If a
single fragment is not sent successfully, only that fragment
will need to be retransmitted instead of the whole packet.
The fragmentation threshold can be anything from 64 to 2312
bytes. The default is 2312.

&minus;i iface
&minus;r RTS_threshold

Set the RTS/CTS threshold for a
given interface. This controls the number of bytes used for
the RTS/CTS handshake boundary. The RTS_threshold can
be any value between 0 and 2312. The default is 2312.

&minus;i iface
&minus;M 0-15

Set monitor mode via bit mask,
meaning:

Bit

Meaning

0

to not dump
802.11 packet.

1

to enable
802.11 monitor.

2

to monitor any
SSID.

4

to not skip
beacons, monitor beacons produces a high system load.

8

to enable full
Aironet header returned via BPF. Note it appears that a SSID
must be set.

&minus;h

Print a list of
available options and sample usage.

SECURITY NOTES

WEP (&rsquo;&rsquo;wired
equivalent privacy&rsquo;&rsquo;) is based on the RC4
algorithm, using a 24 bit initialization vector.

RC4 is
supposedly vulnerable to certain known plaintext attacks,
especially with 40 bit keys. So the security of WEP in part
depends on how much known plaintext is transmitted.

Because of this,
although counter-intuitive, using &rsquo;&rsquo;shared
key&rsquo;&rsquo; authentication (which involves sending
known plaintext) is less secure than using
&rsquo;&rsquo;open&rsquo;&rsquo; authentication when WEP is
enabled.

Devices may
alternate among all of the configured WEP keys when
transmitting packets. Therefore, all configured keys (up to
four) must agree.

EXAMPLES

ancontrol -i an0 -v 0 -k
0x12345678901234567890123456 
ancontrol -i an0 -K 2 
ancontrol -i an0 -W 1 
ancontrol -i an0 -e 0

Sets a WEP key
0, enables &rsquo;&rsquo;Shared Key&rsquo;&rsquo;
authentication, enables full WEP and uses transmit key
0.

HISTORY

The ancontrol utility
first appeared in FreeBSD 4.0.

BUGS

The statistics counters do not
seem to show the amount of transmit and received frames as
increasing. This is likely due to the fact that the an(4)
driver uses unmodified packet mode instead of letting the
NIC perform 802.11/ethernet encapsulation itself.

Setting the
channel does not seem to have any effect.
