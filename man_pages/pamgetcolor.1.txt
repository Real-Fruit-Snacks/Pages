NAME
       pamgetcolor  -  display the average colors from specified regions in an
       image.

SYNOPSIS
       pamgetcolor [-format format] [-radius radius] [-linear]  [-infile  pam-
       file] region1 [region2 ...]

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       pamgetcolor  prints  the average colors of a set of circular regions in
       the input image.

       You specify a  region  as  a  positional  argument  of  the  form  col-
       umn,row[:label], where column and row are the coordinates of the center
       of the circle (first row of pixels is row 0; leftmost column of  pixels
       is  column  0), and label an optional label that pamgetcolor shall dis-
       play to identify that region in its output.  All regions have  he  same
       radius,  specified  by the -radius option.  The region centers must lie
       within the image, but part of a region  may  fall  outside  the  image;
       pamgetcolor  considers only the part that is within the image in calcu-
       lations.

EXAMPLES
       To read the color of the pixel at location (10,14) in the default  for-
       mat:

           pamgetcolor 10,14 -infile test.ppm

       To  read  the colors of three pixels in the default format, assigning a
       label to each pixel:

           pamgetcolor 10,10:topleft 100,100:middle 200,200:bottomright -infile test.ppm

       To read with 16-bit precision the average color in the  circle  with  a
       radius of four pixels and the center at (100,100):

           pamgetcolor -format int:65535 -radius 4 100,100 -infile test.ppm

OPTIONS
       In  addition  to  the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm
       (most notably -quiet, see
        Common Options <index.html#commonoptions>  ),  pamgetcolor  recognizes
       the following command line options:

       -format
              This  specifies  the  format in which to output the colors.  The
              output    is    always    a    Netpbm    color     specification
              <libppm.html#colorname> ; this format tells which of the various
              specifications for the same color the program uses.

              This argument is of the form  formatId[:param],  where  formatId
              specifies  the  format and param is a positive integer parameter
              that, depending on formatId, indicates either precision or  nor-
              malization. The following values are possible for formatId:

       int    Samples  are decimal integers normalized to the maxval specified
              by param.  Example: rgb-255:255/128/64 This format  is  the  de-
              fault, with a maxval of 255.

       norm   Samples  are  floating  point numbers normalized to unity.  E.g.
              rgbi:1.0/0.5/.25 param specifies precision as the number of dig-
              its in the fractional part.

       x11    Samples   are   hexadecimal  numbers  with  param  digits,  e.g.
              rgb:01/ff/8000

       -radius
              sets the radius of the regions.  A value of zero causes  pamget-
              color to measure a single pixel and is the default.

       -infile
              This specifies the Netpbm file to analyze.

              If  you  don't  specify this option, pamgetcolor reads the image
              from Standard Input.

       -linear
              This tells pamgetcolor to work with the intensity-linear  varia-
              tion  of  Netpbm  images  where  the samples are proportional to
              light intensity rather than to brightness, as in true (gamma-ad-
              justed) Netpbm formats.
