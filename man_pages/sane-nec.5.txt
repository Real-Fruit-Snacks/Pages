NAME
       sane-nec - SANE backend for NEC scanners

DESCRIPTION
       The  sane-nec library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) back‐
       end that provides access to NEC SCSI scanners.  This backend should  be
       considered alpha-quality software!  In the current state it is known to
       work with PC-IN500/4C scanners. Other MultiReader  scanner  series  are
       not  supported.  PC-IN  500/4C and MultiReader scanner are only sold in
       Japan (except Multi Reader PetiScan).

       For other scanners, it may or may not work.

       The backend has the following known problems:

              - ColorLineart mode is not supported.

              - Device name is fixed to /dev/scanner

       At present, the following scanners are known to work with this backend.

              Vendor Product id
              ------ -----------
              NEC    PC-IN500/4C

FILES
       /etc/sane.d/nec.conf
              The backend configuration file.

       /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-nec.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-nec.so
              The shared library implementing this backend (present on systems
              that support dynamic loading).

ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_DEBUG_NEC
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this en‐
              vironment variable controls the debug level  for  this  backend.
              E.g.,  a  value  of 128 requests all debug output to be printed.
              Smaller levels reduce verbosity.
