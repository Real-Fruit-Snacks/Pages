DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       pamditherbw dithers a grayscale image.  Dithering  means  turning  each
       shade  of  gray  into  a pattern of black and white pixels that, from a
       distance, look the same as the gray.

       The input should be a PGM image or a PAM image of tuple type GRAYSCALE.
       However, pamditherbw doesn't check, so if you feed it e.g. a PPM image,
       it will produce arbitrary results (actually, it just  takes  the  first
       channel of whatever you give it and treats it as if it represented gray
       levels).

       The output is a PAM with tuple type BLACKANDWHITE.  You can  turn  this
       into  a  PBM  (if you need to use it with an older program that doesn't
       understand PAM) with pamtopnm.

       To do the opposite of dithering, you can usually just scale  the  image
       down  and then back up again with pamscale, possibly smoothing or blur‐
       ring the result with pnmsmooth or pnmconvol.  Or use the  special  case
       program pbmtopgm.

       To dither a color image (to reduce the number of pixel colors), use pp‐
       mdither.

       Another way to convert a grayscale image to a black and white image  is
       thresholding.   Thresholding  is  simply replacing each grayscale pixel
       with a black or white pixel depending  on  whether  its  brightness  is
       above or below a threshold.  That threshold might vary.  Simple thresh‐
       olding is a degenerate case of dithering, so pamditherbw does very sim‐
       ple  thresholding  with  its  -threshold option.  But pamthreshold does
       more sophisticated thresholding.

       If all you want is to change a PGM image with maxval 1 to a PBM  image,
       pamtopnm will do that.

OPTIONS
       In  addition  to  the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm
       (most notably -quiet, see
        Common Options ⟨index.html#commonoptions⟩  ),  pamditherbw  recognizes
       the following command line options:

   Quantization Method
       The  default quantization method is boustrophedonic Floyd-Steinberg er‐
       ror diffusion (-floyd or -fs).

       Also available are simple thresholding  (-threshold);  Bayer's  ordered
       dither (-dither8) with a 16x16 matrix;
        Atkinson
       ⟨http://www.tinrocket.com/projects/programming/graphics/00158/⟩  ;  and
       three  different  sizes  of  45-degree clustered-dot dither (-cluster3,
       -cluster4, -cluster8).

       A space filling curve halftoning method using the Hilbert curve is also
       available (-hilbert).

       Floyd-Steinberg  or  Atkinson  will almost always give the best looking
       results; however, looking good is not always what you  want.   For  in‐
       stance,  you can use thresholding in a pipeline with the pnmconvol, for
       tasks such as edge and peak  detection.   And  clustered-dot  dithering
       gives a newspaper-ish look, a useful special effect.

       Floyd-Steinberg is by far the more traditional, but
        some                                                             claim
       ⟨http://www.tinrocket.com/projects/programming/graphics/00158/⟩  Atkin‐
       son works better.

       The Hilbert curve method is useful for processing images before display
       on devices that do not render individual pixels distinctly (like  laser
       printers).   This  dithering  method  can  give better results than the
       dithering usually done by the laser printers  themselves.   The  -clump
       option  alters  the number of pixels in a clump.  Typically a PGM image
       will have to be scaled to fit on a laser printer page (2400 x 3000 pix‐
       els  for  an  A4 300 dpi page), and then dithered to a PBM image before
       being converted to a postscript file.  A printing pipeline  might  look
       something like:

           pamscale -xysize 2400 3000 image.pgm | pamditherbw -hilbert |  \
             pamtopnm | pnmtops -scale 0.25 > image.ps

   Other Options
       -value This  option  alters the thresholding value for Floyd-Steinberg,
              Atkinson, and simple thresholding.  It should be a  real  number
              between 0 and 1.  Above 0.5 means darker images; below 0.5 means
              lighter.

       -clump This option alters the number of pixels  in  a  clump  when  the
              Hilbert  curve  method  is used.  This is usually an integer be‐
              tween 2 and 100 (default 5).  Smaller clump sizes smear the  im‐
              age  less  and are less grainy, but seem to lose some grey scale
              linearity.

       -randomseed=integer
              The Floyd-Steiberg and Atkinson methods use  random  numbers  to
              diffuse  the error.  This is the seed for the random number gen‐
              erator.  The other methods do not employ random numbers and  ig‐
              nore this option.

              Use  this  to  ensure you get the same image on separate invoca‐
              tions.

              By default, pamditherbw uses a seed derived from the time of day
              and  process  ID, which gives you fairly uncorrelated results in
              multiple invocations.

              This option was new in Netpbm 10.45 (December 2008).

HISTORY
       pamditherbw was new in Netpbm 10.23 (July 2004), but is essentially the
       same  program as pgmtopbm that has existed practically since the begin‐
       ning.  pamditherbw differs from its predecessor  in  that  it  properly
       adds brightnesses (using gamma transformations; pgmtopbm just adds them
       linearly) and that it accepts PAM input in addition to PGM and PBM  and
       produces PAM output.

       pamditherbw obsoletes pgmtopbm.

       -atkinson was new in Netpbm 10.38 (March 2007).
