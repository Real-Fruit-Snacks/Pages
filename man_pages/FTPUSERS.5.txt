FTPUSERS(5) BSD File Formats Manual FTPUSERS(5)

NAME

ftpusers — file
which lists users who are not allowed to use ftp

DESCRIPTION

/etc/ftpusers is used by
ftpd(8); the file contains a list of users who are not
allowed to use the ftp command. For security reasons at
least users like ’’root’’,
’’bin’’,
’’uucp’’ and
’’news’’ should be listed in this
file. Blank lines and lines beginning with ’#’
are ignored.

Note: a lines
with ’#’ in the middle is not a
comment. Don’t put ’#’ after a name to
comment it; use another line, or things will silently fail
on you.

EXAMPLES

/etc/ftpusers might
contain the following entries:

# 
# /etc/ftpusers 
# 
root 
uucp 
news
