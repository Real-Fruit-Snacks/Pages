ZYD(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual ZYD(4)

NAME

zyd — ZyDAS
ZD1211/ZD1211B USB IEEE 802.11b/g wireless network
device

SYNOPSIS

To compile this driver into the
kernel, place the following lines in your kernel
configuration file:

device ehci

device uhci 
device ohci 
device usb 
device zyd 
device wlan 
device wlan_amrr

Alternatively,
to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following line in loader.conf(5):

if_zyd_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION

The zyd driver provides
support for wireless network adapters based around the ZyDAS
ZD1211 and ZD1211B USB chips.

zyd
supports station and monitor mode operation.
Only one virtual interface may be configured at any time.
For more information on configuring this device, see
ifconfig(8).

EXAMPLES

The following example configures
zyd0 to join any BSS network using WEP key
’’0x1deadbeef1’’, channel 11:

ifconfig wlan
create wlandev zyd0 channel 11 \ 
wepmode on wepkey 0x1deadbeef1 weptxkey 1 \ 
inet 192.168.1.1 netmask 255.255.255.0

Join an existing
BSS network, ’’my_net’’:

ifconfig wlan
create wlandev zyd0 192.168.0.2 \ 
netmask 0xffffff00 ssid my_net

DIAGNOSTICS

zyd%d: could not load
firmware (error=%d)  An error occurred while
attempting to upload the firmware to the onboard
microcontroller unit.

zyd%d: could
not send command (error=%s)  An attempt to send a
command to the firmware failed.

zyd%d: sorry,
radio %s is not supported yet  Support for the
specified radio chip is not yet implemented in the driver.
The device will not attach.

zyd%d: device
version mismatch: 0x%x (only >= 43.30
supported)  Early revisions of the ZD1211 chipset
are not supported by this driver. The device will not
attach.

zyd%d: device
timeout  A frame dispatched to the hardware for
transmission did not complete in time. The driver will reset
the hardware. This should not happen.

The original zyd driver
was written by Florian Stoehr

CAVEATS

The zyd driver does not
support a lot of the functionality available in the
hardware. More work is required to properly support the IBSS
and power management features.
