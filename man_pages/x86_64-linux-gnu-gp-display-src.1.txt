NAME
       gp-display-src  -  display the source code, optionally interleaved with
       the disassembly of the target object

SYNOPSIS
       gprofng display src [OPTION(S)] TARGET-OBJECT

DESCRIPTION
       Display the source code listing, or source code interleaved with disas‐
       sembly code, as extracted from the target object (an executable, shared
       object, object file, or a Java .class file).

OPTIONS
       --version
              print the version number and exit.

       --help print usage information and exit.

       --verbose {on|off}
              enable (on) or disable (off) verbose mode; the default is "off".

       -func  list all the functions from the given object.

       -source item tag
              show the source code for item; the tag is used to  differentiate
              in  case of multiple occurences with the same name; the combina‐
              tion of "all -1" selects all the functions in  the  object;  the
              default is "-source all -1".

       -disasm item tag
              show the source code, interleaved with the disassembled instruc‐
              tions; the same definitions for item and tag apply.

       -outfile <filename>
              write results to file <filename>; a dash (-) writes  to  stdout;
              this  is  also  the default; note that this only affects options
              included to the right of this option.
