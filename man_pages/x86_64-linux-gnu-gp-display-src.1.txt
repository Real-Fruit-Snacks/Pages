NAME

gp-display-src
- Display source code and optionally disassembly of the
target object

SYNOPSIS

gprofng
display src [option(s)] target-file

DESCRIPTION

Display the
source code listing, or source code interleaved with
disassembly code, as extracted from the target file (an
executable, shared object, object file, or a Java .class
file).

For example,
this command displays the source code and disassembly
listing for a function called mxv_core that is part
of object file mxv.o:

$ gprofng
display src -disasm mxv_core mxv.o

To list the
source code and disassembly for all the functions in this
file, use the following command:

$ gprofng
display src -disasm all -1 mxv.o

The
target-file is the name of an executable, a shared
object, an object file (.o), or a Java .class file.

If no options
are given, the source code listing of the target-file
is shown. This is equivalent to -source all -1. If
this information is not available, a message to this extent
is printed.

OPTIONS

--version

Print the version number and
exit.

--help

Print usage information and
exit.

-functions

List all the functions from the
given object.

-source item
tag

Show the source code for
item in target-file. The tag is used to
differentiate in case there are multiple occurences with the
same name. See the NOTES section for the definition
of item and tag.

-disasm item
tag

Include the disassembly in the
source listing. The default listing does not include the
disassembly. If the source code is not available, show a
listing of the disassembly only. See the NOTES
section for the definition of item and
tag.

-outfile
filename

Write results to file
filename. A dash (-) writes to stdout. This is also
the default. Note that this option only affects those
options included to the right of the option.

NOTES

Use item
to specify the name of a function, or of a source or object
file that was used to build the executable, or shared
object.

The tag
is an index used to determine which item is being referred
to when multiple functions have the same name. It is
required, but will be ignored if not necessary to resolve
the function.

The item
may also be specified in the form
function’file’, in which case the source
or disassembly of the named function in the source context
of the named file will be used.

The special
item and tag combination all -1, is
used to indicate generating the source, or disassembly, for
all functions in the target-file.
