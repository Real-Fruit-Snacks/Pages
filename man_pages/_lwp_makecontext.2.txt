_lwp_makecontext
âˆ’ initialize an LWP context

SYNOPSIS

#include

#include  
#include 

void
_lwp_makecontext(ucontext_t *ucp, void
(*start_routine)(void *), void
*arg, void *private, caddr_t
stack_base, size_t stack_size);

DESCRIPTION

The
_lwp_makecontext() function initializes the user
context structure pointed to by ucp. The user context
is defined by ucontext(3HEAD). The resulting user
context can be used by _lwp_create(2) for specifying
the initial state of the new LWP. The user context is set up
to start executing the function start_routine with a
single argument, arg, and to call _lwp_exit(2)
if start_routine returns. The new LWP will use the
storage starting at stack_base and continuing for
stack_size bytes as an execution stack. The initial
value in LWP-private memory will be set to private
(see _lwp_setprivate(2)). The signal mask in the user
context is not initialized.
