DESCRIPTION

file-pr
files incoming Problem Reports in the GNATS database, sends
acknowledgments to appropriate parties and logs database
activity.

file-pr
assigns the Problem Report an identification number and then
files it in the GNATS database either under the category
specified in the Category field of the PR, or under the
default category if the Category field is nonexistent or
contains an invalid category name.

For the default
GNATS configuration, the person responsible for that
category and the person responsible for the submitter site
where the PR originated receive a copy of the PR in its
entirety. Optionally, the originator of the PR receives an
acknowledgment that the PR arrived and was filed

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

The
GNATSDB environment variable is used to determine
which database to use. For a local database, it contains the
name of the database to access.

For network
access via gnatsd, it contains a colon-separated list
of strings that describe the remote database, in the form

server:port:databasename:username:password

Any of the
fields may be omitted, but at least one colon must appear;
otherwise, the value is assumed to be the name of a local
database.

If
GNATSDB is not set, it is assumed that the database
is local and that its name is default.
