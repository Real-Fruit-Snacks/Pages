NAME
       g3topbm - convert a Group 3 fax file into a PBM image

SYNOPSIS
       g3topbm   [-kludge]  [-reversebits]  [-stretch]  [-width=pixels  |  pa‐
       per_size={A3|A4|A5|A6|B4}] [-stop_error] [g3file]

       Minimum unique abbreviation of option is acceptable.  You may use  dou‐
       ble  hyphens  instead  of single hyphen to denote options.  You may use
       white space in place of the equals sign to separate an option name from
       its value.

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       g3topbm reads a Group 3 fax file with MH (Modified Huffman) compression
       as input and produces a PBM image as output.

       g3topbm tolerates various deviations from the standard, so  as  to  re‐
       cover  some  of the image if there was a transmission error.  One thing
       it tolerates is lines of varying length.  The standard requires all the
       lines  to be the same length; g3topbm makes the output image as wide as
       the longest line in the input and pads the others  on  the  right.   It
       warns you when it does this.

       You  can  use the stop_error option to make g3topbm insist on valid in‐
       put.

       There is no Netpbm program that understands the other G3  fax  compres‐
       sion methods: MR (Modified Read) and MMR (Modified Modified Read).

       Note  that  the  Group 3 fax file format does not include any kind of a
       signature so that g3topbm might verify it's actually looking  at  a  G3
       file  or that the compression method is MH.  The program will interpret
       any sequence of bytes you give it as if it is G3 and,  while  typically
       issuing a lot of error messages about the file not conforming to the G3
       MH format, will produce output (unless you use -stoperror).  In partic‐
       ular,  if  you  feed g3topbm an MR or MMR file, it will not tell you of
       your mistake.

       There are subformats of TIFF that use the Group 3 fax encodings inside.
       See tifftopnm.

OPTIONS
       In  addition  to  the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm
       (most notably -quiet, see
        Common Options ⟨index.html#commonoptions⟩ ),  g3topbm  recognizes  the
       following command line options:

       -kludge
              Tells  g3topbm  to ignore the first few lines of the file; some‐
              times fax files have some junk at the beginning.

       -reversebits
              Tells g3topbm to interpret bits least-significant first, instead
              of  the  default  most-significant  first.   Apparently some fax
              modems do it one way and others do it the other way.  If you get
              a  whole  bunch  of "bad code word" messages, try using this op‐
              tion.

       -stretch
              This option tells g3topbm to stretch the image vertically by du‐
              plicating  each  row.   This is for the low-quality transmission
              mode.

       -width=pixels
              This option tells g3topbm that the image is supposed to be  pix‐
              els  pixels  wide.   If any line in it is not that size, g3topbm
              issues a warning or fails,  depending  on  whether  you  specify
              -stop_error.

              You cannot specify both -width and -paper_size.

              This option was new in Netpbm 10.33 (March 2006).

       -paper_size={A3,A4,A5,A6,B4}
              This option tells g3topbm for what size paper this image is sup‐
              posed to be formatted.  g3topbm uses the width of the paper  the
              same  way  as  with the -width option.  g3topbm does not use the
              height of the paper for anything.

              You cannot specify both -width and -paper_size.

              This option was new in Netpbm 10.33 (March 2006).

       -stop_error
              This option tells g3topbm to fail when it finds a problem in the
              input.   "Fail"  means  it terminates with a nonzero status code
              with the contents of the output file undefined.

              If you don't specify this option, g3topbm does its best to  work
              around input errors and salvage as much of the image as possible
              in the output image.  It first tries to resynchronize to a later
              line  by searching for the next End Of Line marker, skipping any
              lines or partial lines in between.  It saves  the  beginning  of
              the line in which it encountered the problem.  If the input file
              ends prematurely, g3topbm produces output containing  the  lines
              up to where it encountered the problem.

              g3topbm  issues  warning  messages when it continues in spite of
              input errors.

              This option was new in Netpbm 10.24 (August 2004).  Before that,
              g3topbm  always  failed  when  it  encountered premature EOF and
              never failed when it encountered other problems.
