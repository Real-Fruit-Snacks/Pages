NAME

field - plot a
field (rheolef-7.2)

SYNOPSIS

field [options]
file[.field[.gz]]

DESCRIPTION

Read and output
a finite element field from file.

EXAMPLE

field
square.field 
field square.field -bw 
field box.field

INPUT FILE SPECIFICATION

filename

Specifies the
name of the file containing the input field.

-

Read field on
standard input instead on a file.

-name

When the field
comes from standard input, the file base name is not known
and is set to &rsquo;output&rsquo; by default. This option
allows one to change this default. Useful when dealing with
output formats (graphic, format conversion) that creates
auxiliary files, based on this name.

-Idir

-I dir

Add dir
to the Rheolef file search path. This option is useful e.g.
when the mesh .geo and the .field fikes are in different
directories. This mechanism initializes a search path given
by the environment variable RHEOPATH. If the
environment variable RHEOPATH is not set, the
default value is the current directory.

-mark
string 
-catch string 
-catchmark string

Jump across the
file to the specified string . Label start at the
beginning of a line, preceded by a # mark (see
catchmark(3)).

OUTPUT FILE FORMAT OPTIONS

-field
-text

Output field on
standard output stream in Rheolef ascii (field or geo) text
file format.

-gmsh

Output field on
standard output stream in .gmsh file format.

-gmsh-pos

Output field on
standard output stream in .gmsh-pos file format,
suitable for mesh adaptation purpose.

-bamg-bb

Output field on
standard output stream in bamg-bb text file format, suitable
for mesh adaptation purpose.

-image-format
string

For image or
video capture. The supported argument are .jpg,
.png, .tif and .bmp. This option
should be combined with the paraview render. The
output file is basename.png where basename is the
name of the mesh, or can be set with the -name
option.

-resolution
int int

For the
resolution of an image or a video capture. The argument is a
couple of sizes, separated by a white space. This option can
be used together with the -image-format for any of
the bitmap image formats. This option requires the
paraview render.

GETTING INFORMATION

-min 
-max

Print the min
(resp. max) value of the scalar field and then exit.

-get-geo

Print the name
of the mesh associated to the field and exit.

RENDER OPTIONS

-gnuplot

Use the
gnuplot tool. This is the default in one
dimension.

-paraview

Use the
paraview tool. This is the default for two- and
tri-dimensional geometries.

RENDERING OPTIONS

-color 
-gray 
-black-and-white 
-bw

Use (color/gray
scale/black and white) rendering. Color rendering is the
default.

-[no]showlabel

Show or hide
title, color bar and various annotations. Default is to show
labels.

-label
*string* &zwj; Set the label to show
for the represented value. This supersedes the default
value. -[no]elevation
&zwj; For two dimensional field,
represent values as elevation in the third dimension. The
default is no elevation.
-scale*float*
&zwj; Applies a multiplicative factor
to the field. This is useful e.g. in conjunction with
theelevationoption. The default value is 1.
-[no]stereo
&zwj; Rendering mode suitable for
red-blue anaglyph 3D stereoscopic glasses. This option is
only available withparaview.
-[no]fill
&zwj; Isoline intervals are filled
with color. This is the default. When-nofill, draw
isolines by using lines. -[no]volume
&zwj; For 3D data, render values
using a colored translucid volume. This option requires
theparaviewcode. -[no]cut
&zwj; Cut by a specified plane.
The cutting plane is specified by its origin point and
normal vector. This option requires
theparaviewcode.
-origin*float* [*float*
[*float*]] &zwj; Set the origin of the
cutting plane. Default is (0.5, 0.5, 0.5).
-normal*float* [*float*
[*float*]] &zwj; Set the normal of the
cutting plane. Default is (1, 0, 0).
-isovalue[*float*] \n
-iso[*float*] &zwj; Draw 2d
isoline or 3d isosurface. When the optional float is not
provided, a median value is used. This option requires
theparaviewcode.
-noisovalue
&zwj; Do not draw isosurface. This
is the default. -n-iso*int*
&zwj; For 2D visualizations, the
isovalue table contains regularly spaced values from fmin to
fmax, the bounds of the field.  @addindex
vorticity @addindex stream function
-n-iso-negative*int* &zwj; The
isovalue table is split into negatives and positives values.
Assume there is n_iso=15 isolines: if 4 is requested by this
option, then, there will be 4 negatives isolines, regularly
spaced from fmin to 0 and 11=15-4 positive isolines,
regularly spaced from 0 to fmax. This option is useful when
plotting e.g. vorticity or stream functions, where the sign
of the field is representative. 
@addindex projection @addindex approximation P1
-proj*approx* -proj &zwj;
Convert all selected fields to approximation *approx* by
using a L2 projection. When argument is
omitted,P1approximation is assumed.
-lumped-proj
&zwj;
ForceP1approximation for L2 projection and use a
lumped mass matrix for it.
-round[*float*]
&zwj; Round the input up to the
specified precision. This option, combined
with-field, leads to a round filter. Useful for
non-regression test purpose, in order to compare numerical
results between files with a limited precision, since the
full double precision is machine-dependent.
 -subdivide*int*
&zwj; When using a high order
geometry, the number of points per edge used to draw a
curved element. Default value is the mesh order.
 -deformation -velocity
&zwj; Render vector-valued fields
as deformed mesh usingparavieworgnuplot.
This is the default vector field representation.
Whenvelocity, render vector-valued fields as arrows
usingparaview&rsquo; instead.

COMPONENT EXTRACTION AND DOMAIN REDUCTION

-comp
int 
-comp string

Extract the
i-th component of a vector-valued field. For a tensor-valued
field, indexing components as 00, 01,
11... is supported.

-domain
name

Reduce the
visualization to the specified domain name.

OTHERS OPTIONS

-[no]verbose

Print messages
related to graphic files created and command system calls
(this is the default).

&rsquo;-[no]clean

Clear temporary
graphic files (this is the default).

-[no]execute

Execute graphic
command (this is the default). The -noexecute
variant is useful in conjunction with the -verbose
and -noclean options in order to modify some render
options by hand.

FIELD FILE FORMAT

It contains a
header and a list values at degrees of freedom. The header
contains the field keyword followed by a line
containing a format version number (presently 1), the number
of degrees of freedom (i.e. the number of values listed),
the mesh file name without the .geo extension the
approximation (e.g. P1, P2, etc), and finally the list of
values:

A sample field

1.0 
2.0 
3.0

See also
geo(1) for the .geo mesh file format.

EXAMPLES

The following
command send to vtk the cuted 2d plane of the 3d
field:

field
cube.field -cut -normal 0 1 0 -origin 0.5 0.5 0.5 -vtk

Next, let us
generate the cuted 2d field and its associated mesh:

field
cube.field -cut -normal 0 1 0 -origin 0.5 0.5 0.5 -text >
cube-cut.field

For drawing the
isosurface:

field
cube.field -isovalue 0.5

Finally, let us
generate the isosurface as a 3d surface mesh in the
.geo file format:

field
cube.field -isovalue 0.5 -text > isosurf.geo

This file is
then suitable for others treatments.
