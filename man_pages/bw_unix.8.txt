NAME

bw_unix - UNIX
pipe bandwidth

SYNOPSIS

bw_unix
[ -P  ] [ -W
 ] [ -N  ]
size

DESCRIPTION

bw_unix
creates a pipe and forks a child process which keeps writing
data to the pipe as fast as it can. The benchmark measures
how fast the parent process can read the data in
size-byte chunks from the pipe. Nothing is done with
the data in either the parent (reader) or child (writer)
processes.

The size
specification may end with ’’k’’ or
’’m’’ to mean kilobytes (* 1024) or
megabytes (* 1024 * 1024).

OUTPUT

Output format
is "%0.2f %.2f\n", megabytes,
megabytes_per_second, i.e.,

8.00
25.33

MEMORY UTILIZATION

This benchmark
should move approximately the reported amount of memory.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

Funding for the
development of this tool was provided by Sun Microsystems
Computer Corporation.
