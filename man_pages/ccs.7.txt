NAME

ccs - Cluster
Configuration System

DESCRIPTION

A cluster
environment that shares resources has information that is
essential to correct operation which must be available to
every node in the cluster. This information may include:
names of the nodes composing the cluster, I/O fencing
methods, and more. CCS is the system that makes it
possible for the nodes in a cluster to retrieve the
information they need.

OVERVIEW

The following
is a generic description of the steps one should take to
produce a working CCS environment.

Step 1

Choose a cluster name. It is important to determine a name
for the cluster before starting. The cluster name is what
binds a machine to specific resources that can only be
shared by machines that are members of the same cluster
name.

Step 2

Create the directory /etc/cluster.

Step 3

Create the /etc/cluster/cluster.conf file, according
to the cluster.conf(5) man page, on one node in your
cluster.

Step 4

Start ccsd and test the cluster.conf file by using
ccs_test. If you haven&rsquo;t started a cluster
manager yet, you should use the &rsquo;force&rsquo; option
to ccs_test - see the ccs_test(8) man page for
more info.

If a failure
occurs while parsing the config file, ccs_test should
report "ccs_connect failed: No data available" and
/var/log/messages should report "Unable to parse
/etc/cluster/cluster.conf".
