NAME

shelltool
&minus; run a shell (or other program) in an OpenWindows
terminal window

SYNOPSIS

shelltool
[ &minus;C ] [ &minus;B boldstyle ] [
&minus;I command ] [
generic-tool-arguments ] [ program [
arguments ] ]

AVAILABILITY

This command is
available with the OpenWindows user environment, For
information about installing OpenWindows, refer to the
OpenWindows Installation and Start-Up Guide.

DESCRIPTION

shelltool
is a standard OpenWindows facility for shells or
other programs that use a standard tty-based interface.

When invoked,
shelltool runs a program, (usually a shell) in an
interactive terminal emulator based on a tty subwindow.
Keyboard input is passed to that program. In the OpenWindows
version of shelltool, a restricted pop-up menu is
available from the main display area that allows you to
enable scrolling. Selecting the Enable Scrolling
option from the restricted menu gives shelltool the
full functionality of the cmdtool window, included a
larger pop-up menu from which to select options. Selecting
Disable Scrolling from the pop-up submenu will return
Shelltool to its original state.

OPTIONS

&minus;C

Redirect system console output
to this shelltool.

&minus;B boldstyle

Set the style for displaying bold text to
boldstyle. boldstyle can be a string
specifying one of the choices for the term.boldstyle
default, see Defaults Options, below, or it may be a
numerical value for one of those choices, from 0 to 8,
corresponding to the placement of the choice in the
list. 

&minus;I command

Pass command to the shell. SPACE
characters within the command must be escaped.

generic-tool-arguments

shelltool accepts the
generic tool arguments listed in xview(1).

USAGE

.Xdefaults
File Options 
You can specify a number of defaults using the options in
the .Xdefaults file that effect the behavior of
shelltool. The ones of interest are those that begin
with text,term, or keyboard. See
.xview(1) for more detailed information.

The Terminal
Emulator 
The tty subwindow is a terminal emulator. Whenever a tty
subwindow is created, the startup file ~/.ttyswrc is
read for initialization parameters that are specific to the
tty subwindow.

The .ttyswrc
File 
The command format for this file is:

#

Comment.

set variable

Turn on the specified variable.

mapi key text

When key is typed pretend text was
input. 

mapo key text

When key is typed pretend text was
output. 

The only
currently defined variable is pagemode. key is
one of L1-L15, F1-F15, T1-T15, R1-R15, LEFT ,
or RIGHT (see note below). text may
contain escapes such as \E, \n, ^X, etc. (
ESC , RETURN , and
CTRL-X , respectively). See termcap(5)
for the format of the string escapes that are recognized.
Note: mapi and mapo may be replaced by another
keymapping mechanism in the future.

When using the
default kernel keyboard tables, the keys L1, LEFT ,
RIGHT , BREAK , R8, R10, R12, and R14 cannot be
mapped in this way; they send special values to the tty
subwindow. Also, when using the default kernel keyboard
tables, L1-L10 are now used by XView. See
input_from_defaults(1) and kbd(4S) for more
information on how to change the behavior of the
keyboard.

It is possible
to have terminal-based p special escape sequences. These
escape sequences may also be sent by typing a key
appropriately mapped using the mapo function
described above. The following functions pertain to the tool
in which the tty subwindow resides, not the tty subwindow
itself.

\E[1t

&minus; open

\E[2t

\E[6t

&minus; back

\E[7t

&minus; refresh

\E[8; ROWS ; COLS
t 

&minus; stretch, to ROWS COLS size
(in characters)

\E[11t

&minus; report if open or iconic by sending \E[1t
or \E[2t

\E[13t

&minus; report position by sending \E[3;
TOP ; LEFT t

\E[14t

&minus; report size in pixels by sending \E[4;
HT ; WIDTH t

\E[18t

&minus; report size in characters by sending \E[8;
ROWS ; COLS t

\E[20t

&minus; report icon label by sending
\E]Llabel\E\ 

\E[21t

&minus; report tool header by sending
\E]llabel\E\ 

\E]ltext\E\

&minus; set tool header to text

\E]Ifile\E\

&minus; set icon to the icon contained in file;
file must be in iconedit output format

\E]Llabel\E\

&minus; set icon label to label

\E[> OPT ;...h

&minus; turn SB OPT on ( OPT = 1
=> pagemode), for example, \E[>1;3;4h

\E[> OPT ;...k

&minus; report OPT ; sends
\E[> OPT l or \E[>
OPT h for each
OPT 

\E[> OPT ;...l

&minus; turn OPT off (
OPT = 1 => pagemode), for .B
\E[>1;3; 

See
EXAMPLES for an example of using this
facility.

shelltool
Windows

The window
created by shelltool is based on the text facility
that is described in the textedit man page. The user
is given a prompt at which to type commands and pop-up menus
from which to select command options.

shelltool
windows support cursor motions, using an /etc/termcap
entry called sun-cmd. Command windows automatically
set the TERM environment variable to
sun-cmd. So, if you rlogin(1C) to a machine
that does not have an entry for sun-cmd in its
/etc/termcap file, the error message &rsquo;Type
sun-cmd unknown&rsquo; results. To rectify this, type
the command &rsquo;set TERM
=sun&rsquo;. Programs written using the
curses(3X) or curses(3V) library packages will
work in a command window, but programs hard-coded for
sun-type terminals may not. When supporting a program
that performs cursor motions, the command window
automatically takes on the characteristics of a tty window
(as with shelltool(1)). When that program terminates
or sleeps, the full command window functionality is
restored.

cmdtool
supports programs that use CBREAK and
NO ECHO terminal modes. This support is
normally invisible to the user. However, programs that use
RAW mode, such as rlogin(1C) and
script(1), inhibit command-line editing with the
mouse. In this case, however, tty-style
ERASE, word-kill and line-kill characters can
still be used to edit the current command line.

The
shelltool Menu 
The shelltool window menu is called the Term
Pane menu and contains the following options and their
submenus: 
Enable Page Mode

Enables page mode within
shelltool .

Copy

Places the highlighted text on the clipboard.

PastePuts the contents
of

pointed to by the cusor.

Scrolling

Enables scrolling within shelltool .

EXAMPLES

The following
aliases can be put into your ~/.cshrc file:

# dynamically set the name
stripe of the tool: 
alias header &rsquo;echo &minus;n
"\E]l\!*\E\"&rsquo; 
# dynamically set the label on the icon: 
alias iheader &rsquo;echo &minus;n
"\E]L\!*\E\"&rsquo; 
# dynamically set the image on the icon: 
alias icon &rsquo;echo &minus;n
"\E]I\!*\E\"&rsquo;

BUGS

If more than
256 characters are input to a terminal emulator subwindow
without an intervening NEWLINE , the terminal
emulator may hang. If this occurs, an alert will come up
with a message saying &rsquo;Too many keystrokes in input
buffer&rsquo;. Choosing the Flush Input Buffer
menu item may correct the problem. This is a bug for a
terminal emulator subwindow running on top of or
rlogin(1C) to a machine with pre-4.0 release
kernel.
