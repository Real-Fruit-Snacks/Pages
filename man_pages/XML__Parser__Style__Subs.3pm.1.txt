NAME
       XML::Parser::Style::Subs - glue for handling element callbacks

SYNOPSIS
         use XML::Parser;
         my $p = XML::Parser->new(Style => 'Subs', Pkg => 'MySubs');
         $p->parsefile('foo.xml');

         {
           package MySubs;

           sub foo {
             # start of foo tag
           }

           sub foo_ {
             # end of foo tag
           }
         }

DESCRIPTION
       Each time an element starts, a sub by that name in the package
       specified by the Pkg option is called with the same parameters that the
       Start handler gets called with.

       Each time an element ends, a sub with that name appended with an
       underscore ("_"), is called with the same parameters that the End
       handler gets called with.

       Nothing special is returned by parse.
