NAME

sqlrsh âˆ’
interactive query tool for SQL Relay

SYNOPSIS

sqlrsh
host port socket user passwd [script] 
sqlrsh [-config configfile] -id id
[script]

DESCRIPTION

sqlrsh
is an interactive query tool similar to (though not as
powerful as) SQL Plus, mysql, psql, isql and the like. Run
it and type help; at the prompt for detailed usage
instructions. When sqlrsh starts up, it reads and executes
two rc files, the system rc file (/etc/sqlrelay/sqlrshrc on
Debian) and a personal rc file .sqlrshrc in your home
directory. These files should contain sqlrsh commands,
ending in semicolons, seperated by carraige returns. Any
commands may be used in the rc files, even queries.
