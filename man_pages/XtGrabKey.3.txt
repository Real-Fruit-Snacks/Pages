DESCRIPTION
       XtGrabKey calls XGrabKey specifying the widget's window as the grab
       window if the widget is realized.  The remaining arguments are exactly
       as for XGrabKey.  If the widget is not realized, or is later unreal‐
       ized, the call to XGrabKey will be performed (again) when the widget is
       realized and its window becomes mapped.  In the future, if XtDis‐
       patchEvent is called with a KeyPress event matching the specified key‐
       code and modifiers (which may be AnyKey or AnyModifier, respectively)
       for the widget's window, the Intrinsics will call XtUngrabKeyboard with
       the timestamp from the KeyPress event if either of the following condi‐
       tions is true:

       •  There is a modal cascade and the widget is not in the active subset
          of the cascade and the keyboard was not previously grabbed, or

       •  XFilterEvent returns True.

       XtUngrabKey calls XUngrabKey specifying the widget's window as the un‐
       grab window if the widget is realized.  The remaining arguments are ex‐
       actly as for XUngrabKey.  If the widget is not realized, XtUngrabKey
       removes a deferred XtGrabKey request, if any, for the specified widget,
       keycode, and modifiers.

       If the specified widget is realized XtGrabKeyboard calls XGrabKeyboard
       specifying the widget's window as the grab window.  The remaining argu‐
       ments and return value are exactly as for XGrabKeyboard.  If the widget
       is not realized, XtGrabKeyboard immediately returns GrabNotViewable.
       No future ungrab is implied by XtGrabKeyboard.

       XtUngrabKeyboard calls XUngrabKeyboard with the specified time.

       XtGrabButton calls XGrabButton specifying the widget's window as the
       grab window if the widget is realized.  The remaining arguments are ex‐
       actly as for XGrabButton.  If the widget is not realized, or is later
       unrealized, the call to XGrabButton will be performed (again) when the
       widget is realized and its window becomes mapped.  In the future, if
       XtDispatchEvent is called with a ButtonPress event matching the speci‐
       fied button and modifiers (which may be AnyButton or AnyModifier, re‐
       spectively) for the widget's window, the Intrinsics will call XtUngrab‐
       Pointer with the timestamp from the ButtonPress event if either of the
       following conditions is true:

       •  There is a modal cascade and the widget is not in the active subset
          of the cascade and the pointer was not previously grabbed, or

       •  XFilterEvent returns True.

       XtUngrabButton calls XUngrabButton specifying the widget's window as
       the ungrab window if the widget is realized.  The remaining arguments
       are exactly as for XUngrabButton.  If the widget is not realized,
       XtUngrabButton removes a deferred XtGrabButton request, if any, for the
       specified widget, button, and modifiers.

       XtGrabPointer calls XGrabPointer specifying the widget's window as the
       grab window.  The remaining arguments and return value are exactly as
       for XGrabPointer.  If the widget is not realized, XtGrabPointer immedi‐
       ately returns GrabNotViewable.  No future ungrab is implied by XtGrab‐
       Pointer.

       XtUngrabPointer calls XUngrabPointer with the specified time.
