NAME

sssd-files -
SSSD files provider

DESCRIPTION

This manual
page describes the files provider for sssd(8). For a
detailed syntax reference, refer to the &ldquo;FILE
FORMAT&rdquo; section of the sssd.conf(5) manual
page.

The files
provider mirrors the content of the passwd(5) and
group(5) files. The purpose of the files provider is
to make the users and groups traditionally only accessible
with NSS interfaces also available through the SSSD
interfaces such as sssd-ifp(5).

Another reason
is to provide efficient caching of local users and
groups.

Please note
that besides explicit domain definition the files provider
can be configured also implicitly using
'enable_files_domain' option. See sssd.conf(5) for
details.

SSSD never
handles resolution of user/group "root". Also
resolution of UID/GID 0 is not handled by SSSD. Such
requests are passed to next NSS module (usually files).

When SSSD is
not running or responding, nss_sss returns the UNAVAIL code
which causes the request to be passed to the next
module.

CONFIGURATION OPTIONS

In addition to
the options listed below, generic SSSD domain options can be
set where applicable. Refer to the section &ldquo;DOMAIN
SECTIONS&rdquo; of the sssd.conf(5) manual page for
details on the configuration of an SSSD domain. But the
purpose of the files provider is to expose the same data as
the UNIX files, just through the SSSD interfaces. Therefore
not all generic domain options are supported. Likewise, some
global options, such as overriding the shell in the
&ldquo;nss&rdquo; section for all domains has no effect on
the files domain unless explicitly specified per-domain.

passwd_files
(string)

Comma-separated list of one or
multiple password filenames to be read and enumerated by the
files provider, inotify monitor watches will be set on each
file to detect changes dynamically.

Default:
/etc/passwd

group_files
(string)

Comma-separated list of one or
multiple group filenames to be read and enumerated by the
files provider, inotify monitor watches will be set on each
file to detect changes dynamically.

Default:
/etc/group

fallback_to_nss
(boolean)

While updating the internal
data SSSD will return an error and let the client continue
with the next NSS module. This helps to avoid delays when
using the default system files /etc/passwd and /etc/group
and the NSS configuration has 'sss' before 'files' for the
'passwd' and 'group' maps.

If the files
provider is configured to monitor other files it makes sense
to set this option to 'False' to avoid inconsistent behavior
because in general there would be no other NSS module which
can be used as a fallback.

Default:
True

EXAMPLE

The following
example assumes that SSSD is correctly configured and files
is one of the domains in the [sssd] section.

[domain/files]

id_provider = files

To leverage
caching of local users and groups by SSSD nss_sss module
must be listed before nss_files module in
/etc/nsswitch.conf.

passwd: sss
files 
group: sss files
