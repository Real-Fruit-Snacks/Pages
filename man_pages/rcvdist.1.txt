DESCRIPTION

rcvdist
accepts a message on its standard input and resends a copy
of the message to all of the addresses listed on its command
line.

The format of
the Resent-xxx header fields is specified by the form file
&ldquo;rcvdistcomps&rdquo;. If a file named
&ldquo;rcvdistcomps&rdquo; exists in the user&rsquo;s
nmh directory, it will be used instead of the default file.
You may specify an alternate forms file with -form
formfile.

The
&ldquo;rcvdistcomps&rdquo; file uses the format
string facility described in mh-format(5). In
addition to the standard format escapes, rcvdist also
recognizes the following component escape:
