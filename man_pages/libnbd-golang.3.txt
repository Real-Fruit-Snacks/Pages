NAME

libnbd-golang -
how to use libnbd from Go

SYNOPSIS

import
"libguestfs.org/libnbd" 
h, err := libnbd.Create() 
if err != nil { 
panic(err) 
} 
defer h.Close() 
uri := "nbd://localhost&quot; 
err = h.ConnectUri(uri) 
if err != nil { 
panic(err) 
} 
size, err := h.GetSize() 
if err != nil { 
panic(err) 
} 
fmt.Printf("size of %s = %d\n", uri, size)

DESCRIPTION

This manual
page documents how to use libnbd to access Network Block
Device (NBD) servers from the Go programming language. The
Go bindings work very similarly to the C bindings so you
should start by reading libnbd(3).

HANDLES

Create a libnbd
handle of type "Libnbd" by calling Create().

You can either
close the handle explicitly by a deferred call to
"h.Close()" or it will be closed automatically
when it is garbage collected.

ERRORS

Most calls
return either a single "LibnbdError" or a pair
"(ret, LibnbdError)".

EXAMPLES

This directory
contains examples written in Go:
