NAME

/etc/deluser.conf
&minus; configuration file for deluser(8) and
delgroup(8).

DESCRIPTION

The file
/etc/deluser.conf contains defaults for the programs
deluser(8) and delgroup(8). Each option takes
the form option = value. Double or single
quotes are allowed around the value. Comment lines must have
a hash sign (#) at the beginning of the line.

deluser(8)
and delgroup(8) also read /etc/adduser.conf,
see adduser.conf(5); settings in deluser.conf
may overwrite settings made in adduser.conf.

The valid
configuration options are: 
REMOVE_HOME

Removes the home directory and
mail spool of the user to be removed. Value may be 0
(don&rsquo;t delete) or 1 (do delete).

REMOVE_ALL_FILES

Removes all files on the system
owned by the user to be removed. If this option is activated
REMOVE_HOME has no effect. Values may be 0 or 1.

BACKUP

If REMOVE_HOME or REMOVE_ALL_FILES is
activated all files are backuped before they are removed.
The backup file that is created defaults to
username.tar(.gz|.bz2) in the directory specified by the
BACKUP_TO option. The compression method is chosen to
the best that is available. Values may be 0 or 1.

BACKUP_TO

If BACKUP is activated,
BACKUP_TO specifies the directory the backup is
written to. Default is the current directory.

NO_DEL_PATHS

A list of regular expressions,
space separated. All files to be deleted in course of
deleting home directories or deleting files owned by the
user to be deleted are checked against each of these regular
expressions. If a match is detected, the file is not
deleted. Defaults to a list of system directories, leaving
only /home.

In other words:
By default only files below /home belonging to that specific
user are going to be deleted.

ONLY_IF_EMPTY

Only delete a group if there
are no users belonging to this group. Defaults to 0.

EXCLUDE_FSTYPES

A regular expression which
describes all file systems which should be excluded when
looking for files of a user to be deleted. Defaults to
"(proc|sysfs|usbfs|devpts|tmpfs|afs)".
