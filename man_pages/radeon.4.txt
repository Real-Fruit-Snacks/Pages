CONFIGURATION DETAILS

Please refer to
xorg.conf(5) for general configuration details. This section
only covers configuration details specific to this
driver.

The following
driver Options are supported: 
Option "SWcursor"
"boolean"

Selects software cursor. The
default is off.

Option "Accel"
"boolean"

Enables or disables all
hardware acceleration. 
The default is on.

Option
"ZaphodHeads"
"string"

Specify the RandR output(s) to
use with zaphod mode for a particular driver instance. If
you use this option you must use this option for all
instances of the driver. 
For example: Option "ZaphodHeads"
"LVDS,VGA-0" will assign xrandr outputs LVDS
and VGA-0 to this instance of the driver.

Option
"ColorTiling"
"boolean"

The framebuffer can be
addressed either in linear or tiled mode. Tiled mode can
provide significant performance benefits with 3D
applications. Tiling will be disabled if the drm module is
too old or if the current display configuration does not
support it. On R600+ this enables 1D tiling mode. 
The default value is on for R/RV3XX, R/RV4XX,
R/RV5XX, RS6XX, RS740, R/RV6XX, R/RV7XX, RS780, RS880,
EVERGREEN, CAYMAN, ARUBA, Southern Islands, and Sea Islands
and off for R/RV/RS1XX, R/RV/RS2XX, RS3XX, and
RS690/RS780/RS880 when fast fb feature is enabled.

Option
"ColorTiling2D"
"boolean"

The framebuffer can be
addressed either in linear, 1D, or 2D tiled modes. 2D tiled
mode can provide significant performance benefits over 1D
tiling with 3D applications. Tiling will be disabled if the
drm module is too old or if the current display
configuration does not support it. KMS ColorTiling2D is only
supported on R600 and newer chips and requires Mesa 9.0 or
newer for R6xx-ARUBA, Mesa 9.2 or newer for Southern
Islands, and Mesa 10.1 or newer for Sea Islands. 
The default value is on for R/RV6XX, R/RV7XX, RS780,
RS880, EVERGREEN, CAYMAN, ARUBA, Southern Islands, and Sea
Islands.

Option "DRI"
"integer"

Define the maximum level of DRI
to enable. Valid values are 2 for DRI2 or 3 for DRI3. The
default is 3 for DRI3 if the Xorg version is >=
1.18.3 and glamor is enabled, otherwise 2 for DRI2.
Note: DRI3 may not work correctly in all cases with EXA,
enable at your own risk.

Option
"EnablePageFlip"
"boolean"

Enable DRI2 page flipping. The
default is on. Pageflipping is supported on all
radeon hardware.

Option "TearFree"
"boolean"

Set the default value of the
per-output &rsquo;TearFree&rsquo; property, which controls
tearing prevention using the hardware page flipping
mechanism. TearFree is on for any CRTC associated with one
or more outputs with TearFree on. Two separate scanout
buffers need to be allocated for each CRTC with TearFree on.
If this option is set, the default value of the property is
&rsquo;on&rsquo; or &rsquo;off&rsquo; accordingly. If this
option isn&rsquo;t set, the default value of the property is
auto, which means that TearFree is on for rotated
outputs, outputs with RandR transforms applied and for RandR
1.4 secondary outputs, otherwise off.

Option
"AccelMethod"
"string"

Chooses between available
acceleration architectures. Valid values are EXA (for
pre-TAHITI GPUs) and glamor (for R300 or higher). The
default is glamor with R600 or newer (with Xorg >=
1.18.3, otherwise with TAHITI or newer), otherwise
EXA.

The following
driver Options are supported for glamor :

Option "ShadowPrimary"
"boolean"

This option enables a so-called
"shadow primary" buffer for fast CPU access to
pixel data, and separate scanout buffers for each display
controller (CRTC). This may improve performance for some 2D
workloads, potentially at the expense of other (e.g. 3D,
video) workloads. Note in particular that enabling this
option currently disables page flipping. The default is
off.

The following
driver Options are supported for EXA : 
Option "EXAVSync"
"boolean"

This option attempts to avoid
tearing by stalling the engine until the display controller
has passed the destination region. It reduces tearing at the
cost of performance and has been known to cause instability
on some chips. The default is off.

Option
"EXAPixmaps"
"boolean"

Under KMS, to avoid thrashing
pixmaps in/out of VRAM on low memory cards, we use a
heuristic based on VRAM amount to determine whether to allow
EXA to use VRAM for non-essential pixmaps. This option
allows us to override the heuristic. The default is
on with > 32MB VRAM, off with 

Option
"SwapbuffersWait"
"boolean"

This option controls the
behavior of glXSwapBuffers and glXCopySubBufferMESA calls by
GL applications. If enabled, the calls will avoid tearing by
making sure the display scanline is outside of the area to
be copied before the copy occurs. If disabled, no scanline
synchronization is performed, meaning tearing will likely
occur. Note that when enabled, this option can adversely
affect the framerate of applications that render frames at
less than refresh rate.

The default
value is on.

TEXTURED VIDEO ATTRIBUTES

The driver
supports the following X11 Xv attributes for Textured Video.
You can use the "xvattr" tool to query/set those
attributes at runtime. 
XV_VSYNC

XV_VSYNC is used to control
whether textured adapter synchronizes the screen update to
the monitor vertical refresh to eliminate tearing. It has
two values: &rsquo;off&rsquo;(0) and &rsquo;on&rsquo;(1).
The default is &rsquo;on&rsquo;(1).

XV_CRTC

XV_CRTC is used to control
which display controller (crtc) the textured adapter
synchronizes the screen update with when XV_VSYNC is
enabled. The default, &rsquo;auto&rsquo;(-1), will sync to
the display controller that more of the video is on; when
this is ambiguous, the display controller associated with
the RandR primary output is preferred. This attribute is
useful for things like clone mode where the user can best
decide which display should be synced. The default is
&rsquo;auto&rsquo;(-1).

XV_BICUBIC

XV_BICUBIC is used to control
whether textured adapter should apply a bicubic filter to
smooth the output. It has three values:
&rsquo;off&rsquo;(0), &rsquo;on&rsquo;(1) and
&rsquo;auto&rsquo;(2). &rsquo;off&rsquo; means never apply
the filter, &rsquo;on&rsquo; means always apply the filter
and &rsquo;auto&rsquo; means apply the filter only if the X
and Y sizes are scaled to more than double to avoid blurred
output. Bicubic filtering is not currently compatible with
other Xv attributes like hue, contrast, and brightness, and
must be disabled to use those attributes. The default is
&rsquo;off&rsquo;(0).
