NAME

sqlr-start
&minus; startup SQLRelay

SYNOPSIS

sqlr-start
[-id id] [-config configfile]

DESCRIPTION

sqlr-start
program is provided to simplify the startup process.

The sqlr-start
program starts up one instance of sqlr-listener, one
instance of sqlr-scaler and the number of sqlr-connection
daemons specified in the config file for the given id.

The sqlr-start
program also checks to see if a sqlr-cachemanager is
running. If one is then it leaves it running. If not then it
starts one.

If for some
reason you don&rsquo;t want to use sqlr-start, you can start
the daemons individually.

SEE ALSO

See
sqlr-cachemanager(1) for an important note about
it.
