NAME
       pgmtolispm - convert a PGM image to Lisp Machine format

SYNOPSIS
       pgmtolispm

       [pgmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       pgmtolispm  reads a PGM image as input and produces a Lisp Machine bit‐
       map as output.

       This is the file format read by the tv:read-bit-array-file function  on
       TI Explorer and Symbolics lisp machines.

       Given a PGM (instead of a PBM), pgmtolispm outputs a multi-plane image.
       This is probably not useful unless you have a color lisp machine.

       Multi-plane bitmaps on lisp machines are color;  but  the  lispm  image
       file  format  does  not  include  a color map, so we must treat it as a
       graymap instead.  This is unfortunate.

OPTIONS
       There are no command line options defined specifically for  pgmtolispm,
       but it recognizes the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm
       (See
        Common Options ⟨index.html#commonoptions⟩ .)

SEE ALSO
       lispmtopgm(1), pgm(1)

LIMITATIONS
       Output width is always rounded up to the nearest multiple of  32;  this
       might not always be what you want, but it probably is (arrays which are
       not modulo 32 cannot be passed to the Lispm BITBLT function,  and  thus
       cannot easily be displayed on the screen).

       No color.
