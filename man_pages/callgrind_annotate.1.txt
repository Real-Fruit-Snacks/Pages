- post-processing tool for the Callgrind

SYNOPSIS

callgrind_annotate
[options]
[callgrind-out-file [source-files...]] 

DESCRIPTION

callgrind_annotate
takes an output file produced by the Valgrind tool Callgrind
and prints the information in an easy-to-read form.

OPTIONS

-h
--help

Show summary of options.

--version

Show version of
callgrind_annotate.

--show=A,B,C
[default: all]

Only show figures for events
A,B,C.

--threshold=
[default: 99%]

Percentage of counts (of
primary sort event) we are interested in.

callgrind_annotate
stops printing functions when the sum of the cost percentage
of the printed functions is bigger or equal to the given
threshold percentage.

--sort=A,B,C

Sort columns by events A,B,C
[event column order].

Optionally,
each event is followed by a : and a threshold, to specify
different thresholds depending on the event.

callgrind_annotate
stops printing functions when the sum of the cost percentage
of the printed functions for all the events is bigger or
equal to the given event threshold percentages.

When one or
more thresholds are given via this option, the value of
--threshold is ignored.

--show-percs=
[default: no]

When enabled, a percentage is
printed next to all event counts. This helps gauge the
relative importance of each function and line.

--auto=
[default: yes]

Annotate all source files
containing functions that helped reach the event count
threshold.

--context=N
[default: 8]

Print N lines of context before
and after annotated lines.

--inclusive=
[default: no]

Add subroutine costs to
functions calls.

--tree=
[default: none]

Print for each function their
callers, the called functions or both.

-I,
--include=

Add dir to the list of
directories to search for source files.
