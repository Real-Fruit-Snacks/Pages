NAME

msgs &mdash; system
messages and junk mail program

SYNOPSIS

msgs
[&minus;fhlpq] [number] [&minus;number]

msgs [&minus;s] 
msgs [&minus;c] [&minus;days]

DESCRIPTION

The msgs utility is used
to read system messages. These messages are sent by mailing
to the login &rsquo;msgs&rsquo; and should be short pieces
of information which are suitable to be read once by most
users of the system.

The msgs
utility is normally invoked each time you login, by placing
it in the file .login (or .profile if you use
sh(1)). It will then prompt you with the source and subject
of each new message. If there is no subject line, the first
few non-blank lines of the message will be displayed. If
there is more to the message, you will be told how long it
is and asked whether you wish to see the rest of the
message. The possible responses are:

&minus;y

Type the rest
of the message.

RETURN

Synonym for
y.

&minus;n

Skip this
message and go on to the next message.

&minus;

Redisplay the
last message.

&minus;q

Drop out of
msgs; the next time msgs will pick up where it
last left off.

&minus;s

Append the
current message to the file
&rsquo;&rsquo;Messages&rsquo;&rsquo; in the current
directory; &rsquo;s&minus;&rsquo; will save the previously
displayed message. A &rsquo;s&rsquo; or
&rsquo;s&minus;&rsquo; may be followed by a space and a file
name to receive the message replacing the default
&rsquo;&rsquo;Messages&rsquo;&rsquo;.

&minus;m

A copy of the
specified message is placed in a temporary mailbox and
mail(1) is invoked on that mailbox. Both &rsquo;m&rsquo; and
&rsquo;s&rsquo; accept a numeric argument in place of the
&rsquo;&minus;&rsquo;.

The msgs
utility keeps track of the next message you will see by a
number in the file .msgsrc in your home directory. In
the directory /var/msgs it keeps a set of files whose
names are the (sequential) numbers of the messages they
represent. The file /var/msgs/bounds shows the low
and high number of the messages in the directory so that
msgs can quickly determine if there are no messages
for you. If the contents of bounds is incorrect it
can be fixed by removing it; msgs will make a new
bounds file the next time it is run with the
&minus;s option. If msgs is run with any
option other than &minus;s, an error will be
displayed if /var/msgs/bounds does not exist.

The
&minus;s option is used for setting up the posting of
messages. The line

msgs: "|
/usr/bin/msgs &minus;s"

should be
included in /etc/mail/aliases (see newaliases(1)) to
enable posting of messages.

The
&minus;c option is used for performing cleanup on
/var/msgs. A shell script entry to run msgs
with the &minus;c option should be placed in
/etc/periodic/daily (see periodic(8)) to run every
night. This will remove all messages over 21 days old. A
different expiration may be specified on the command line to
override the default. You must be the superuser to use this
option.

Options when
reading messages include:

&minus;f

Do not say
&rsquo;&rsquo;No new messages.&rsquo;&rsquo;. This is useful
in a .login file since this is often the case
here.

&minus;q

Queries whether
there are messages, printing &rsquo;&rsquo;There are new
messages.&rsquo;&rsquo; if there are. The command
&rsquo;&rsquo;msgs &minus;q&rsquo;&rsquo; is often used in
login scripts.

&minus;h

Print the first
part of messages only.

&minus;l

Cause only
locally originated messages to be reported.

num

A message
number can be given on the command line, causing msgs
to start at the specified message rather than at the next
message indicated by your .msgsrc file. Thus

msgs &minus;h
1

prints the
first part of all messages.

&minus;number

Start
number messages back from the one indicated in the
.msgsrc file, useful for reviews of recent
messages.

&minus;p

Pipe long
messages through more(1).

Within
msgs you can also go to any specific message by
typing its number when msgs requests input as to what
to do.

ENVIRONMENT

The msgs utility uses the
HOME and TERM environment variables for the default home
directory and terminal type.

FILES 
/var/msgs/*

database

~/.msgsrc

number of next
message to be presented
