GO-VERSION(1)               General Commands Manual              GO-VERSION(1)

NAME
       go-version - print the build information for Go executables

SYNOPSIS
       go version [-m] [-v] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
       Go  version reports the Go version used to build each of the named exe‐
       cutable files.

       If no files are named on the command line, go version  prints  its  own
       version information.

       If  a directory is named, go version walks that directory, recursively,
       looking for recognized Go binaries and reporting  their  versions.   By
       default,  go  version does not report unrecognized files found during a
       directory scan. The -v flag causes it to report unrecognized files.

       The -m flag causes go version to print each executable's embedded  mod‐
       ule  version information, when available. In the output, the module in‐
       formation consists of multiple lines following the version  line,  each
       indented by a leading tab character.
