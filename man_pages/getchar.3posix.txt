GETCHAR(3POSIX)            POSIX Programmer's Manual           GETCHAR(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       getchar — get a byte from a stdin stream

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdio.h>

       int getchar(void);

DESCRIPTION
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with  the
       ISO C  standard.  Any  conflict between the requirements described here
       and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017
       defers to the ISO C standard.

       The getchar() function shall be equivalent to getc(stdin).

RETURN VALUE
       Refer to fgetc().

ERRORS
       Refer to fgetc().

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       If the integer value returned by getchar() is stored into a variable of
       type char and then compared against the integer constant EOF, the  com‐
       parison may never succeed, because sign-extension of a variable of type
       char on widening to integer is implementation-defined.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
