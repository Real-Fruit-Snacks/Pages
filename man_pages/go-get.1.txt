GO-GET(1)                   General Commands Manual                  GO-GET(1)

NAME
       go-get - add dependencies to current module and install them

SYNOPSIS
       go get [-t] [-u] [-v] [build flags] [packages]

DESCRIPTION
       Get  resolves its command-line arguments to packages at specific module
       versions, updates go.mod  to  require  those  versions,  and  downloads
       source code into the module cache.

       To add a dependency for a package or upgrade it to its latest version:

               go get example.com/pkg

       To upgrade or downgrade a package to a specific version:

               go get example.com/pkg@v1.2.3

       To  remove  a dependency on a module and downgrade modules that require
       it:

               go get example.com/mod@none

       See https://golang.org/ref/mod#go-get for details.

       In earlier versions of Go, ‘go get’ was used to build and install pack‐
       ages.   Now, ‘go get’ is dedicated to adjusting dependencies in go.mod.
       ‘go install' may be used to build and install commands instead. When  a
       version  is  specified,  ‘go install’ runs in module-aware mode and ig‐
       nores the go.mod file in the current directory. For example:

               go install example.com/pkg@v1.2.3
               go install example.com/pkg@latest

       See ‘go help install’ or https://golang.org/ref/mod#go-install for  de‐
       tails.

       ‘go get’ accepts the following flags.

       -t     The  -t  flag  instructs get to consider modules needed to build
              tests of packages specified on the command line.

       -u     The -u flag instructs get to update modules providing  dependen‐
              cies of packages named on the command line to use newer minor or
              patch releases when available.

       -u=patch
              The -u=patch flag (not -u patch) also instructs  get  to  update
              dependencies, but changes the default to select patch releases.

       When the -t and -u flags are used together, get will update test depen‐
       dencies as well.

       -x     The -x flag prints commands as they are executed. This is useful
              for  debugging  version  control commands when a module is down‐
              loaded directly from a repository.

       For more about modules, see https://golang.org/ref/mod.

       For more about specifying packages, see go-packages(7).

       This text describes the behavior of get using modules to manage  source
       code  and  dependencies. If instead the go command is running in GOPATH
       mode, the details of get's flags and effects change, as does  ‘go  help
       get'.  See ‘go help gopath-get’ or go-gopath-get(1).
