CTAU(4) BSD/i386 Kernel Interfaces Manual CTAU(4)

NAME

ctau — driver for
synchronous Cronyx Tau WAN adapters

SYNOPSIS

device ctau

Additional
options:

device sppp 
options NETGRAPH 
options NETGRAPH_CRONYX

In
/boot/device.hints:

hint.ctau.0.at="isa"

hint.ctau.0.port="0x240" 
hint.ctau.0.irq="15" 
hint.ctau.0.drq="7"

DESCRIPTION

The ctau driver needs
either sppp(4) or netgraph(4). Which one to use is
determined by the NETGRAPH_CRONYX option. If this option is
present in your kernel configuration file, the ctau
driver will be compiled with netgraph(4) support. Otherwise,
it will be compiled with sppp(4) support.

The base I/O
port address specified in /boot/device.hints must
match the port address set by the jumpers on the board. The
DMA I/O channel and interrupt request numbers are configured
by software at adapter initialization. Legal values are:

Port:

0x200, 0x220,
0x240, 0x260, 0x280, 0x2a0, 0x2c0, 0x2e0, 0x300, 0x320,
0x340, 0x360, 0x380, 0x3a0, 0x3c0, 0x3e0

IRQ:

3, 5, 7, 10,
11, 12, 15

DMA:

5, 6, 7

The ctau
driver supports autodetection. As for all non-PNP hardware,
using autodetection could lead to some potential problems
with other devices during the hardware detection process. It
is always better to specify hardware resources manually.

Refer to
sconfig(8) for information about the ctau adapter
configuration.

HARDWARE

The ctau driver supports
the following cards:

•

Cronyx Tau (RS-232/V.35)

•

Cronyx Tau/R
(RS-530/RS-449)

•

Cronyx Tau/E1 (fractional
E1)

•

Cronyx Tau/G703 (unframed
E1)

HISTORY

The ctau driver was added
in FreeBSD 5.3 and FreeBSD 4.10. The ctau
