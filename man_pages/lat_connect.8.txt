NAME

lat_connect -
measure interprocess connection latency via TCP/IP

SYNOPSIS

lat_connect
-s 
lat_connect [ -P  ] [ -W
 ] [ -N  ]
hostname 
lat_connect -S hostname

DESCRIPTION

lat_connect
is a client/server program that measures interprocess
connection latencies. The benchmark times the creation and
connection of an AF_INET (aka TCP/IP) socket to a remote
server. Care is take that the connection time does not
include any other overhead, such as the
gethostbyname() or remote port lookups since these
add more overhead than the connection establishment
itself.

lat_connect
has three forms of usage: as a server (-s), as a client
(lat_connect localhost), and as a shutdown (lat_connect -S
localhost).

OUTPUT

The reported
time is in microseconds per connection. Output format is
like so

TCP/IP
connection cost to localhost: 1006 microseconds
