ET(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual ET(4)

NAME

et â€” Agere ET1310
10/100/Gigabit Ethernet driver

SYNOPSIS

To compile this driver into the
kernel, place the following lines in your kernel
configuration file:

device
miibus 
device et

Alternatively,
to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following line in loader.conf(5):

if_et_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION

The et driver supports
PCI Express Ethernet adapters based on the Agere ET1310
chip.

The et
driver supports the following media types:

autoselect

Enable
autoselection of the media types and options. The user can
manually override the autoselected mode by adding media
options to the /etc/rc.conf file.

10baseT/UTP

Set 10Mbps
operation. The mediaopt option can also be used to
select either full-duplex or half-duplex
modes.

100baseTX

Set 100Mbps
(Fast Ethernet) operation. The mediaopt option can
also be used to select either full-duplex or
half-duplex modes.

1000baseT

Set 1000Mbps
(Gigabit Ethernet) operation. The mediaopt option can
only be set to full-duplex mode.

The et
driver supports the following media options:

full-duplex

Force
full-duplex operation.

half-duplex

Force
half-duplex operation.

Note that the
1000baseT media type is only available if it is supported by
the adapter. For more information on configuring this
device, see ifconfig(8).

HARDWARE

The et driver supports
Agere ET1310 10/100/Gigabit Ethernet adapters.

TUNABLES 
hw.et.rx_intr_npkts

This value
controls how many packets should be received before a
receive interrupt is generated. The default value is 32. It
is recommended to set this value above 38 to prevent the
host from being livelocked under a high degree of
stress.

hw.et.rx_intr_delay

This value
delays the generation of receive interrupts in units of ~4
microseconds. It is used together with
hw.et.rx_intr_npkts to achieve RX interrupt
moderation. The default value is 20.

hw.et.tx_intr_nsegs

This value
controls how many segments (not packets) should be
transmitted before a transmit interrupt is generated. The
default value is 126. It is recommended to set this value
below 280 to prevent the TX ring from underflowing.

hw.et.timer

This value
controls how often a timer interrupt should be generated. It
is used together with hw.et.tx_intr_nsegs to achieve
TX interrupt moderation. The default value is 1000000000
(nanoseconds).
