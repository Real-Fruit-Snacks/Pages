NAME

pmTypeStr,
pmTypeStr_r - convert a performance metric type into
a string

C SYNOPSIS

#include

const char
*pmTypeStr(int type); 
char *pmTypeStr_r(int type, char
*buf, int buflen);

cc ...
-lpcp

DESCRIPTION

Given a
performance metric type, pmTypeStr produces a
terse ASCII equivalent, appropriate for use in error and
diagnostic messages. The pmTypeStr_r function does
the same, but stores the result in a user-supplied buffer
buf of length buflen, which should have room
for at least 20 bytes.

The value for
type is typically extracted from a pmDesc
structure, following a call to pmLookupDesc(3) for a
particular performance metric.

Examples are
32 (for type equals PM_TYPE_32),
U64 (for type equals PM_TYPE_U64),
STRING (for type equals
PM_TYPE_STRING), etc.

NOTES

Both of these
functions are safe to call from threaded contexts.
