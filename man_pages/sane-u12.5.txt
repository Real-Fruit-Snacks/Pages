sane-u12(5)              SANE Scanner Access Now Easy              sane-u12(5)

NAME
       sane-u12  -  SANE  backend  for  Plustek USB flatbed scanners, based on
       older parport designs

DESCRIPTION
       The sane-u12 library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy)  back‐
       end  that  provides  access  to USB flatbed scanners based on Plusteks'
       ASIC 98003 (parallel-port  ASIC)  and  a  GeneSys  Logics'  USB-parport
       bridge chip.

SUPPORTED DEVICES
       The  backend  is  able  to support some early Plustek USB scanners that
       based their old parport design around the ASIC 98003 and other rebadged
       Plustek devices. The following tables will give you a short overview.

       If  your Plustek scanner has another Product ID, then the device is NOT
       supported by this backend.

       Vendor Plustek - ID: 0x07B3

CONFIGURATION
       To use your scanner with this backend, you need at least two entries in
       the configuration file /etc/sane.d/u12.conf

              [usb] vendor-id product-id
              device /dev/usbscanner

       [usb]  tells the backend, that the following devicename (here /dev/usb‐
       scanner) has to be interpreted as USB scanner device.  If  vendor-  and
       product-id  has not been specified, the backend tries to detect this by
       its own. If device is set to auto then  the  next  matching  device  is
       used.

       The Options:

       option warmup t
              t specifies the warmup period in seconds

       option lampOff t
              t  is the time in seconds for switching off the lamps in standby
              mode

       option lOffonEnd b
              b specifies the behaviour when closing the backend, 1 --> switch
              lamps off, 0 --> do not change lamp status

       See the u12.conf file for examples.

       Note: You have to make sure, that the USB subsystem is loaded correctly
       and  you  have  access  to  the  device-node.  For  more  details   see
       sane-usb(5)  manpage.  You might use sane-find-scanner(1) to check that
       you have access to your device.

       Note:
       If there's no configuration file, the backend defaults to device auto

FILES
       /etc/sane.d/u12.conf
              The backend configuration file

       /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-u12.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-u12.so
              The shared library implementing this backend (present on systems
              that support dynamic loading).

ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_CONFIG_DIR
              This environment variable specifies the list of directories that
              may contain the configuration file.  On *NIX systems, the direc‐
              tories are separated by a colon (`:'), under OS/2, they are sep‐
              arated by a semi-colon (`;').  If this variable is not set,  the
              configuration  file  is  searched  in  two  default directories:
              first,  the  current  working  directory  (".")  and   then   in
              /etc/sane.d.  If the value of the environment variable ends with
              the directory separator character, then the default  directories
              are  searched  after  the explicitly specified directories.  For
              example, setting SANE_CONFIG_DIR to "/tmp/config:" would  result
              in directories tmp/config, ., and /etc/sane.d being searched (in
              this order).

       SANE_DEBUG_U12
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this en‐
              vironment  variable  controls  the debug level for this backend.
              Higher debug levels increase the verbosity of the output.

              Example: export SANE_DEBUG_U12=10

CONTACT AND BUG-REPORTS
       Please send any information and bug-reports to:
       SANE Mailing List

       Additional info and hints can be obtained from our
       Mailing-List archive at:
       http://www.sane-project.org/mailing-lists.html

       To  obtain debug messages from the backend, please set the environment-
       variable SANE_DEBUG_U12  before  calling  your  favorite  scan-frontend
       (i.e.  xscanimage(1)), i.e.:

       export SANE_DEBUG_U12=20 ; xscanimage

       The value controls the verbosity of the backend.

KNOWN BUGS & RESTRICTIONS
       * The driver is in alpha state, so please don't expect too much!!!

       *  When  using  libusb,  it  might be, that the backend hangs.  In that
       case, reconnect the scanner.
