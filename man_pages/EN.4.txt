EN(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual EN(4)

NAME

en &mdash; device driver
for Midway-based ATM interfaces

SYNOPSIS

To compile this driver into the
kernel, place the following lines in your kernel
configuration file:

device en

device atm 
device utopia

Alternatively,
to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following line in loader.conf(5):

if_en_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION

The en device driver
supports Midway-based ATM interfaces including the Efficient
Networks, Inc. ENI-155 and Adaptec ANA-59x0. Midway is an
AAL5 SAR (Segmentation and Reassembly) chip.

For configuring
the card for IP see natmip(4).

The following
sysctls are recognized by the driver additionally to those
handled by utopia(4):

hw.atm.enX.istats

Contains an array of
uint32_t with internal driver statistics.

hw.atm.enX.debug

This is a bit map of debugging
options. This variable is only available when the driver is
compiled with debugging support.

The driver
supports the media options sdh, noscramb and
unassigned (see utopia(4)).

Chuck Cranor of Washington
University implemented en driver in 1996 for
NetBSD.

CAVEATS

on PCI. The first generation PCI chipsets do not work or
exhibit poor performance.
