NAME

g3cat -
concatenate multiple g3 documents

SYNOPSIS

g3cat [-l] [-a]
g3-file1 ...

DESCRIPTION

g3cat
concatenates g3 files. These can either be
’raw’, that is, bitmaps packed according to the
CCITT T.4 standard for one-dimensional bitmap encoding, or
’digifax’ files, created by GNU’s
GhostScript package with the digifax drivers. Its
output is a concatenation of all the input files, in raw G3
format, with two white lines in between.

If a - is given
as input file, stdin is used.

If the input
data is malformed, a warning is printed to stderr, and the
output file will have a blank line at this place.

OPTIONS

-l

separate files with a one-pixel
wide black line.

-h 

specifies the number of blank
lines g3cat should prepend to each page. Default is
0.

-L 

limit lenght of output page to
maximum  lines.

SPECIAL-CASE OPTIONS

-w

specifies the desired page
width in pixels per line. Default is 1728 PELs, and this is
mandatory if you want to send the fax to a standard fax
machine. If one of the input files doesn’t match this
line width (for example because it was created by a broken
G3 creator), a warning is printed, and the line width is
transparently fixed.

-a

byte-align the end-of-line codes (EOL) in the file.
Every EOL will end at a byte boundary, that is, with a 01
byte. 

-p 

specifies a minimum number of
bytes that each output line must be padded to. Padding is
done with 0-bits before the EOL code.

-R

suppress output of end-of-page code (RTC).

Example

The following
example will put a header line on a given g3 page,
’page1’ and put the result into
’page2’:

echo
’$header’ | pbmtext | pbm2g3 | g3cat - page1
>page2
