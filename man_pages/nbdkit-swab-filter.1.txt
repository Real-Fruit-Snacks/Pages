NAME

nbdkit-swab-filter
- nbdkit filter for swapping byte order

SYNOPSIS

nbdkit
--filter=swab PLUGIN [PLUGIN-ARGS...]
[swab-bits=8|16|32|64]

DESCRIPTION

"nbdkit-swab-filter"
is a filter for nbdkit(1) which swaps bytes in the
underlying plugin.

One use for
this is to read disk images which were formatted on the
Atari Falcon, where the IDE controller is wired in reverse
order.

EXAMPLE

Swap bytes
from a disk image 
nbdkit --filter=swab file file=disk.img

The above
command serves the disk image disk.img, swapping even
and odd bytes:

disk.img 0 1 2
3 4 5 ... 
&#9587; &#9587; &#9587; 
output 1 0 3 2 5 4 ...

This filter
truncates the size of the plugin down to the alignment
determined by swab-bits (since operating on an unaligned
tail would be awkward). If you need to round the image size
up instead to access the last few bytes, combine this filter
with nbdkit-truncate-filter(1); fortunately,
sector-based disk images are already suitably sized.

Note that this
filter fails operations where the offset or count are not
aligned to the swab-bits boundaries; if you need byte-level
access, apply the nbdkit-blocksize-filter(1) before
this one, to get read-modify-write access to individual
bytes.

PARAMETERS

swab-bits=8

This turns off the filter.

swab-bits=16

This is the default setting
which swaps pairs of bytes. This is suitable when reading
and writing to Atari Falcon drives.

swab-bits=32

This swaps the endianness of
each 4 byte word in the disk, ie:

input 0 1 2 3 4
5 6 7

output 3 2 1 0
7 6 5 4

swab-bits=64

This swaps the endianness of
each 8 byte word in the disk, ie:

input 0 1 2 3 4
5 6 7

output 7 6 5 4
3 2 1 0

This can be
used to make nbdkit-pattern-plugin(1) little endian
instead of big endian.

FILES

$filterdir/nbdkit-swab-filter.so

The filter.

Use
"nbdkit --dump-config" to find the location of
$filterdir.
