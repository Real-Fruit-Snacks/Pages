IF_NAMEINDEX(3POSIX)       POSIX Programmer's Manual      IF_NAMEINDEX(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       if_nameindex — return all network interface names and indexes

SYNOPSIS
       #include <net/if.h>

       struct if_nameindex *if_nameindex(void);

DESCRIPTION
       The if_nameindex() function  shall  return  an  array  of  if_nameindex
       structures,  one structure per interface. The end of the array is indi‐
       cated by a structure with an if_index field  of  zero  and  an  if_name
       field of NULL.

       Applications  should call if_freenameindex() to release the memory that
       may be dynamically allocated by this function, after they have finished
       using it.

RETURN VALUE
       An  array of structures identifying local interfaces. A null pointer is
       returned upon an error, with errno set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The if_nameindex() function may fail if:

       ENOBUFS
              Insufficient resources are available to complete the function.
