PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       wcscasecmp, wcscasecmp_l, wcsncasecmp, wcsncasecmp_l — case-insensitive
       wide-character string comparison

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       int wcscasecmp(const wchar_t *ws1, const wchar_t *ws2);
       int wcscasecmp_l(const wchar_t *ws1, const wchar_t *ws2,
           locale_t locale);
       int wcsncasecmp(const wchar_t *ws1, const wchar_t *ws2, size_t n);
       int wcsncasecmp_l(const wchar_t *ws1, const wchar_t *ws2,
           size_t n, locale_t locale);

DESCRIPTION
       The  wcscasecmp()  and  wcsncasecmp()  functions are the wide-character
       equivalent of the strcasecmp()  and  strncasecmp()  functions,  respec‐
       tively.

       The  wcscasecmp() and wcscasecmp_l() functions shall compare, while ig‐
       noring differences in case, the wide-character string pointed to by ws1
       to the wide-character string pointed to by ws2.

       The  wcsncasecmp()  and  wcsncasecmp_l() functions shall compare, while
       ignoring differences in case, not more than n wide-characters from  the
       wide-character  string  pointed  to by ws1 to the wide-character string
       pointed to by ws2.

       The wcscasecmp() and wcsncasecmp() functions use the current locale  to
       determine the case of the wide characters.

       The  wcscasecmp_l() and wcsncasecmp_l() functions use the locale repre‐
       sented by locale to determine the case of the wide characters.

       When the LC_CTYPE category of the locale being used is from  the  POSIX
       locale,  these  functions shall behave as if the wide-character strings
       had been converted to lowercase and then a comparison of wide-character
       codes performed.  Otherwise, the results are unspecified.

       The  information  for wcscasecmp_l() and wcsncasecmp_l() about the case
       of the characters comes from the locale represented by locale.

       The behavior is undefined if the locale argument to  wcscasecmp_l()  or
       wcsncasecmp_l() is the special locale object LC_GLOBAL_LOCALE or is not
       a valid locale object handle.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon completion, the wcscasecmp() and  wcscasecmp_l()  functions  shall
       return  an  integer greater than, equal to, or less than 0 if the wide-
       character string pointed to by ws1 is,  ignoring  case,  greater  than,
       equal to, or less than the wide-character string pointed to by ws2, re‐
       spectively.

       Upon completion, the wcsncasecmp() and wcsncasecmp_l() functions  shall
       return  an integer greater than, equal to, or less than 0 if the possi‐
       bly null wide-character terminated string pointed to by ws1 is,  ignor‐
       ing  case, greater than, equal to, or less than the possibly null wide-
       character terminated string pointed to by ws2, respectively.

       No return values are reserved to indicate an error.
