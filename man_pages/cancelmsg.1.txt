NAME

cancelmsg -
Cancel an E-mail message

SYNOPSIS

cancelmsg {msgid}
["reason"] 

DESCRIPTION

cancelmsg
removes a message from the mail queue. There will be no more
attempts to deliver this message, and a standard delivery
failure notice is sent to the return address listed on the
message. You can only cancel your own messages. The
superuser can cancel any message. An attempt to cancel a
message will fail if the message has already been sent (of
course), or if a delivery attempt is currently in progress.
Because a delivery attempt is usually started as soon as an
E-mail message is added to the mail queue, a cancellation
attempt is only effective if the message cannot be
immediately delivered for some reason, or if the system is
very busy and is working on a mail backlog. cancelmsg
works by marking all pending recipients as undeliverable. A
non-delivery report is then generated and sent in the normal
fashion.

msgid is
the message queue id that can be obtained from the
mailq(1)
[1]
, command. A reason is
optional. The message does not disappear into a black void.
The message will be returned as undeliverable, citing
reason. A generic error message will be used if
reason is not specified.

BUGS

A
non-delivery report may not be sent immediately, but delayed
until the message's turn comes up in the scheduling
queue.

There
is no immediate indication if the message cancellation
worked. A subsequent non-delivery report is the only
indication of a successful cancel. If it doesn't come, it
means the message wasn't cancelled in time.

A
non-delivery report will not be sent for recipients whose
delivery status notification does not include the FAIL
notice.
