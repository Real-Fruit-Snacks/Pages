NAME

debhelper-obsolete-compat
- List of no longer supported compat levels

SYNOPSIS

This document
contains the upgrade guidelines from all compat levels which
are no longer supported. Accordingly it is mostly for
historical purposes and to assist people upgrading from a
non-supported compat level to a supported level.

For upgrades
from supported compat levels, please see
debhelper(7).

UPGRADE LIST FOR COMPAT LEVELS

The following
is the list of now obsolete compat levels and their
changes.

v1

This is the original debhelper compatibility level, and
so it is the default one. In this mode, debhelper will use
debian/tmp as the package tree directory for the
first binary package listed in the control file, while using
debian/package for all other packages listed in the
control file.

This mode is
deprecated.

v2

In this mode, debhelper will
consistently use debian/package as the package tree
directory for every package that is built.

This mode is
deprecated.

v3

This mode works like v2, with
the following additions:

-

Debhelper config files support
globbing via * and ?, when appropriate. To
turn this off and use those characters raw, just prefix with
a backslash.

-

dh_makeshlibs makes the postinst and
postrm scripts call ldconfig.

-

Every file in etc/ is automatically flagged as a
conffile by dh_installdeb.

This mode is
deprecated.

v4

Changes from v3 are:

-

dh_makeshlibs -V will not
include the Debian part of the version number in the
generated dependency line in the shlibs file.

-

You are encouraged to put the new ${misc:Depends}
into debian/control to supplement the
${shlibs:Depends} field.

-

dh_fixperms will make all files in bin/
directories and in etc/init.d executable.

-

dh_link will correct existing links to conform
with policy.

This mode is
deprecated.

v5

This is the lowest supported
compatibility level.

Changes from v4
are:

-

Comments are ignored in
debhelper config files.

-

dh_strip --dbg-package now specifies the name of
a package to put debugging symbols in, not the packages to
take the symbols from.

-

dh_installdocs skips installing empty files.

-

dh_install errors out if wildcards expand to
nothing.
