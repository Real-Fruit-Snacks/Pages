NAME

nbdkit-noextents-filter
- disable extents in the underlying plugin

SYNOPSIS

nbdkit
--filter=noextents plugin

DESCRIPTION

&ldquo;Extents&rdquo;
are a feature of the NBD protocol / nbdkit which allow the
client to detect sparse regions of the underlying disk.
"nbdkit-noextents-filter" disables this so that
the plugin appears to be fully allocated, at least to a
client that requests structured replies. It is also possible
to use the --no-meta-contexts or --no-sr
options to nbdkit to prevent the client from negotiating
extents at all, but that is accompanied by more side effects
than this filter.

This filter can
be useful when combined with nbdkit-file-plugin(1)
serving a file from a file system known to have poor
lseek(2) performance ("tmpfs" is known to be one
such system).

PARAMETERS

There are no
parameters specific to nbdkit-noextents-filter. Any
parameters are passed through to and processed by the
underlying plugin in the normal way.

FILES

$filterdir/nbdkit-noextents-filter.so

The filter.

Use
"nbdkit --dump-config" to find the location of
$filterdir.

VERSION

"nbdkit-noextents-filter"
first appeared in nbdkit 1.14.
