NAME
       pnmalias - antialias a PNM image

SYNOPSIS
       pnmalias

       [-bgcolor color]

       [-fgcolor color]

       [-bonly]

       [-fonly]

       [-balias]

       [-falias]

       [-weight w]

       [pnmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       pnmalias reads a PNM image as input, and applies anti-aliasing to back‐
       ground and foreground pixels.  If the input file  is  a  PBM,  pnmalias
       promotes  the  output anti-aliased image to a PGM, and prints a message
       informing the user of the change in format.

OPTIONS
       In addition to the options common to all programs  based  on  libnetpbm
       (most notably -quiet, see
        Common  Options  ⟨index.html#commonoptions⟩ ), pnmalias recognizes the
       following command line options:

       -bgcolor colorb sets the background color the colorb.

       -fgcolor colorf sets the foreground color to colorf.

       Pixels with these values will be anti-aliased.   By  default,  pnmalias
       takes  the  background  color  to  be black, and foreground color to be
       white.

       Specify the  color  (color)  as  described  for  the  argument  of  the
       pnm_parsecolor() library routine ⟨libnetpbm_image.html#colorname⟩ .

       Note that even when dealing with PGMs, background and foreground colors
       need to be specified in the fashion described above.  In this case, pn‐
       malias takes the background and foreground pixel values to be the value
       of the red component for the specified color.

       -bonly says to apply anti-aliasing only to the background pixels.

       -fonly says to apply anti-aliasing only to the foreground pixels.

       -balias says to apply anti-aliasing to  all  pixels  surrounding  back‐
       ground pixels.

       -falias  says  to  apply  anti-aliasing to all pixels surrounding fore‐
       ground pixels.

       If you specify neither -balias  nor  -falias,  pnmalias  applies  anti-
       aliasing only among neighboring background and foreground pixels.

       -weight  w says to use w as the central weight for the aliasing filter.
       w must be a real number in the range 0 < w < 1.  The lower the value of
       w is, the "blurrier" the output image is.  The default is w = 1/3.
