DESCRIPTION

elogind
is a system service that manages user logins. It is
responsible for:

&bull; Keeping
track of users and sessions, their processes and their idle
state

&bull;
Providing PolicyKit-based access for users to operations
such as system shutdown or sleep

&bull;
Implementing a shutdown/sleep inhibition logic for
applications

&bull; Handling
of power/sleep hardware keys

&bull;
Multi-seat management

&bull; Session
switch management

&bull; Device
access management for users

&bull; Removing
of all System V and POSIX IPC objects belonging to the user
after the last of the user's sessions terminated. See
RemoveIPC= in logind.conf(5) about how to
configure this behavior.

User sessions
are registered in elogind via the pam_elogind(8) PAM
module.

See
logind.conf(5) for information about the
configuration of this service.
