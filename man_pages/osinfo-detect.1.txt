NAME

osinfo-detect -
Detect the operating system on installable media or
trees

SYNOPSIS

osinfo-detect
[OPTIONS...] PATH|URI

DESCRIPTION

Examine the
"PATH" or "URI" to determine what (if
any) operating system it is for, and whether it is
installable or is a Live image. By default "PATH"
or "URI" will be interpreted as pointing to ISO
media. To request examination of an install tree instead,
the option --type=tree should be given.

The output
information is formatted for humans;

OPTIONS

--format=plain

--type=media|tree

Switch between looking for
CD/DVD ISO media (media, the default) or install
trees (tree)

--all

Report all operating systems with matching media,
instead of only the first match.

EXIT STATUS

The exit status
will be 0 if an operating system was detected, or 1 if none
was found.
