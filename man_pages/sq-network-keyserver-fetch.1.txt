NAME

sq network
keyserver fetch - Retrieve certificates from key servers

SYNOPSIS

sq network
keyserver fetch [OPTIONS] QUERY

DESCRIPTION

Retrieve
certificates from key servers.

By default, any
returned certificates are stored in the local certificate
store. This can be overridden by using
&rsquo;--output&rsquo; option.

When a
certificate is retrieved from a verifying key server
(currently, this is limited to a list of known servers:
&rsquo;hkps://keys.openpgp.org&rsquo;,
&rsquo;hkps://keys.mailvelope.com&rsquo;, and
&rsquo;hkps://mail-api.proton.me&rsquo;), and imported into
the local certificate store, the User IDs are also
certificated with a local server-specific key. That proxy
certificate is in turn certified as a minimally trusted CA
(trust amount: 1 of 120) by the local trust root. How much a
proxy key server CA is trusted can be tuned using &rsquo;sq
pki link add&rsquo; or &rsquo;sq pki link retract&rsquo; in
the usual way.
