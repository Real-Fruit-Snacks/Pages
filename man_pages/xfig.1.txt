NAME

xfig - Facility
for Interactive Generation of figures under X11 
Version 3.2.9

SYNOPSIS

xfig
[options] [file]

DESCRIPTION

Xfig is
a menu-driven tool that allows the user to draw and
manipulate objects interactively under the X Window System.
If file is given, it specifies the name of a file to
be edited.

The bulk of the
documentation for xfig is in an HTML-based reference
guide. See the Help menu in xfig or point your
browser at /usr/share/doc/xfig/html/index.html. There
are both English and Japanese versions.

When using a
two-button mouse instead of a three-button mouse, use the
 key and the right button at the same
time to effect the action of the middle button.

Xfig is
available from https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcj/.

The
Fig2dev package is used when printing or exporting
the output from xfig. The fig2dev program is
automatically called by xfig as a back-end processor
to produce various types of output:

LaTeX,
Metafont, PDF, PostScript or Encapsulated PostScript, CGM
and EMF (mostyl used under Windows), tk (tcl/tk tool command
language/tool kit package), SVG, GIF, JPEG, PCX, PNG, PPM,
TIFF, XBM, XPM, Gerber, AutoCAD Slide, IBM-GL (HP/GL), Pic
and PiCTeX. For use with TeX/LaTeX: box, epic, eepic,
eepicemu, pict2e, pstricks, tikz.

See man fig2dev
for all options.

The
Fig2dev package is available from
https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcj/.

OPTIONS

-help

Print all command-line options
for xfig and quit.

-a[llownegcoords]

Allow panning into the negative
region of the canvas. This is the default

-au[torefresh]

Make xfig look at the timestamp
on the .fig file and automatically load it and display it
every time it changes.

-bal[loon_delay]
msec

Cause popup information
balloons to be delayed by msec milliseconds. The
default is 500 milliseconds.

-butt[on]
font

Cause the font used for most
buttons to be font (default = 6x13).

-but_[per_row]
number

Specify the number of buttons
wide the mode panel should be. This is useful in conjunction
with the -pheight parameter to reduce the canvas
height for small screens.

-cbg
color

Use color as the
background color for the canvas. If you want to set the
background of everything in xfig (e.g. menus, etc.) use the
general -bg option.

-center

Set the print option to print
the figure centered on the page. This is the default.

-centim[ers]

Make centimeters the unit of
choice. See also -metric.

-cfg
color

Use color as the default
color for objects. If you want to set the foreground of
everything in xfig (e.g. menus, etc.) use the general
-fg option.

-correct_font_size

Normally, fig2dev uses
1/80 inch for font size increments (for historical reasons),
instead of the more proper
&rsquo;&rsquo;points&rsquo;&rsquo; (1/72 inch) that
xfig uses. This option makes xfig call fig2dev with
the -F option to make it use points (1/72 inch).

-deb[ug]

Turn on debugging mode. Prints
various debugging messages like font names etc.

-dep[th]

Choose depth of visual desired.
Your server must support the desired visual and depth
chosen. Use xdpyinfo to see what visuals and depths
are supported. See also the -visual option.

-donta[llownegcoords]

Don&rsquo;t allow panning into
the negative region of the canvas. The default is to allow
panning in the negative region.

-dontshowb[alloons]

Prevents xfig from popping up
the information balloons. See also -showballoons.

-dontshowl[engths]

Don&rsquo;t show lengths of
lines as they are being drawn. This is the default.

-dontshowz[erolines]

Don&rsquo;t show axis zero
lines on the canvas. The default is to show them.

-dontsw[itchcmap]

Prevents xfig from switching to
a private colormap if there aren&rsquo;t enough colors
available in the default colormap. See also
-max_image_colors.

-exportL[anguage]
language

Specifies the default language
to be used for when exporting a fig file. Choices are:

---------------------------------------------------------------

-export_m[argin]
width

Set the size of the border
margin around the figure for exporting to bitmap,
PostScript, Encapsulated PostScript, or HTML MAP formats.
This is in units of points (1/72th inch). The default is
0.

-fli[pvisualhints]

Flip left/right mouse indicator
messages for mice whose buttons have been switched. The
default is to NOT flip the messages.

-flu[shleft]

Set the print option to print
the figure flush left. The default is to center the figure
on the page.

-free[hand_resolution]
resolution

Set the resolution of the
freehand drawing mode to resolution pixels. This is
the number of pixels the mouse must move before xfig adds
another point to the object being drawn.

-geom[etry]
[WxH][+X+Y]

You may use the -geometry
option or resource to size and/or position the xfig
window, or you may use -pwidth and/or
-pheight to specify the canvas size in inches or
centimeters. If you use the -geom option to make the
xfig window smaller than the default, you may have to use
the -but_per_row option to tell xfig to put 3 or 4
buttons per row on the left mode panel.

-gh[ostscript]
ghostscript executable

Specify the name or path to the
ghostscript executable. The default is gs. This version of
xfig links into the ghostscript library. The ghostscript
executable is not needed, it is only called as a
fallback-solution.

-grid_c[olor]
color

Draw the grid on the canvas in
this color (default: red).

-grid_u[nit]
unit

Only used when in inches mode
to choose between showing fractions or decimal inches in the
rulers and grid. Any of the following may be used to force
decimal inches: "ten", "tenth",
"10, "1/10". If any other value is used for
this option, the rulers will show 1/16 inch divisions.

-hidd[entext]

Start xfig with the
hidden text mode for text objects. The Hidden
attribute is used for figures that will be used with
LaTeX and is applicable only to the display of the
document in xfig. It means that the text itself is
not shown onscreen, but only the string
&rsquo;&rsquo;&rsquo;&rsquo;. This is to keep
long sequences of LaTeX formatting commands from
making the screen messy and hard to read. The default for
the Hidden flag is off.

-dontshowd[epthmanager]

Hide the depth manager panel.
The default is to show the panel.

-icon_[view]

Show the library objects as
icons. This is the default. The other mode is
-list_view.

-iconG[eometry]
+X+Y

Specifies the position for the
icon.

-ima[ge_editor]
editor

Specify bitmap editor to use
when &rsquo;&rsquo;Edit Image&rsquo;&rsquo; button is
pressed in Picture Object panel.

-inc[hes]
(or -imp[erial])

Make inches the unit of choice.
This is the default.

-ins[tallowncmap]

Install own colormap. Normally,
xfig uses the current colormap.

-internalBW
width

Use lines of width width
between all buttons and panels (default 1).

-jpeg[_quality]
quality

Set the quality factor for
exporting to the jpeg format. The default is 75.

-k[eyFile]
compose-key-file

Use compose-key-file
instead of CompKeyDB for compose (meta) key database.
If there are no &rsquo;&rsquo;/&rsquo;&rsquo;s in the
name, the file must reside in the xfig library
directory, $XFIGLIBDIR, usually
/usr/local/lib/X11/xfig. If there are any
&rsquo;&rsquo;/&rsquo;&rsquo;s in the name it is
taken as is (not relative to $XFIGLIBDIR). If there
is a leading &rsquo;&rsquo;~/&rsquo;&rsquo; in the
string then the &rsquo;&rsquo;~&rsquo;&rsquo; is
expanded to the user&rsquo;s home directory.

-lan[dscape]

Make xfig come up in
landscape mode (10.5" x 8"). This is the default;
however as the orientation is stored with Fig files, when
you load a Fig file the orientation will change as required.
This is only true for files of version 3.0 or higher. 
See also -portrait.

-lat[exfonts]

Start xfig with
LaTeX font selection. Normally, the PostScript
fonts are available as the default. This flag selects the
LaTeX fonts to start.

-le[ft]

Change the position of the side
panel window to the left of the canvas window. This is the
default.

-library_d[ir]
[directory | file]

Specify directory or file
containing directory names where Fig object libraries are
located. There may be sub-directories there and
sub-sub-directories, etc.

-library_i[con_size]
size

Specify the size of the icons
shown for library objects. The default is 60 pixels, with
the minimum being 40 and the maximum being 120.

-lis[t_view]

Show the library objects as a
list of names. The default mode is -icon_view.

-mag[nification]
mag

Set export and print
magnification in %.

-max[_image_colors]
numcols

Limit the number of colors used
for imported images to numcols (default 64).

-me[tric]

Make centimeters the unit of
choice. The option -centimeters may also be used. Fig
files saved in metric mode are, due to rounding issues,
scaled down by about 5% when saved, and scaled up when read
in. Using -inches or -imperial avoids the
scaling.

After xfig is started you may change the units
from metric to imperial or vice versa from a popup menu
available by pressing mouse button 3 in the units box
where the two rulers meet.

-mo[nochrome]

Use black and white only.

-mu[ltiple]

Sets multiple page mode for
print or export. See also -single.

-nointernational

Switch off international
support. This can be done if text objects only contain ASCII
characters. (Characters beyond ASCII are interpreted as
Latin 1). If there are error messages when starting xfig
regarding "missing charsets in string to fontset
conversion", setting this option avoids the error.

-noo[verlap]

When exporting in multiple page
mode, causes no overlap from page to page. This is the
default. See also -overlap.

-nor[mal]
font

Cause the font used for the
message window to be font. This font is also used on
the canvas when the global settings "Show line
lengths" or "Show vertex numbers" are true
(default = 6x13).

-nosp[lash]

Don&rsquo;t show the startup
splash screen. The default is to show it ( -splash
).

-not[rack]

Turn off cursor (mouse)
tracking arrows.

-nowrite_bak

When saving a drawing into an
existing .fig file xfig will first rename that file by
appending ".bak" to the name. This option disables
this feature.

-ov[erlap]

When exporting in multiple page
mode, causes overlap from page to page of about 10%. See
also -nooverlap.

-pag[eborder]
color

Draw the page border on the
canvas in this color (default light blue). The page border
is turned on by the -showpageborder option (resource
Fig.showpageborder), and shows the edges of the current
export paper size.

-pap[er_size]
size

Set the initial paper size for
Export and Print. Choices are

Note that this
doesn&rsquo;t affect the size of the drawing canvas. Use the
-pheight and -pwidth options for that.

-ph[eight]
height

Make the xfig canvas
height high (where height is either cm or in,
depending on the -metric setting).

-po[rtrait]

Make xfig come up in
portrait mode (8.5" x 9"). See note about
landscape mode.

-pw[idth]
width

Make the xfig canvas
width wide (where width is either cm or in,
depending on the -metric setting).

-righ[t]

Change the position of the side
panel window to the right of the canvas window (default:
left).

-rigi[d]

Start xfig with the
rigid text mode for text objects. The Rigid
attribute forces text to remain the same size even if inside
a compound object that is scaled up or down. The default is
off.

-ru[lerthick]

Set the height(width) of the
top(side) rulers in pixels. The default (and minimum) is
24.

-scale_factor
scale

Scale every figure read in by
this value. This is useful in conjunction with the
-update option to do batch scaling of figures.

-showa[llbuttons]

Show all the xfig
indicator buttons instead of only those relevant to the
current drawing mode. Normally, the buttons line
width, area-fill, grid mode, text
size, etc. are only visible when they are relevant to
the current drawing mode. The -showallbuttons option
makes all of the indicator buttons visible at all times.
This takes up more screen real estate, but allows the user
to see all settable parameters.

-showb[alloons]

Forces xfig to pop up
the information balloons when the mouse passws over a
button. This is the default. See also -dontshowballoons
.

-showd[epthmanager]

Show the depth manager panel.
This panel lets one show or hide objects at various depths.
This is the default.

-showl[engths]

Makes xfig show the
lengths of lines being drawn, in red text near the line
itself. Also, when points are moved or added. In addition,
imagine a triangle formed with the line segment as the
hypotenuse, and a vertical and horizontal line forming the
other two sides. These lines and their lengths are also
drawn in red as the point is moved or added. This mode is
ignored when drawing in freehand mode. 
This flag may be toggled by pressing i
(default).

-shown[ums]

With this option, xfig will
draw all objects with a red number next to each vertex. This
is generally only useful for debugging.

-showp[ageborder]

Makes xfig show the
border of the current paper size in the color specified by
the -pageborder option (default: light blue).

-showz[erolines]

Show axis zero lines on the
canvas. This is the default

-si[ngle]

Sets single page mode for print
or export. This is the default. See also
-multiple.

-sm[ooth_factor]
factor

Enable smoothing when exporting
to the bitmap formats (e.g. GIF, PNG, etc.). The allowed
values are 0 (no smoothing), 2 or 4 (most smoothing). This
parameter is passed to ghostscript in the -dTextAlphaBits
-dGraphicsAlphaBits options to smooth the figure.

-spec[ialtext]

Start xfig with the
TeX text mode for text objects. This means that
characters that have a special meaning to TeX/LaTeX, e.g.,
&rsquo;$&rsquo; or &rsquo;\&rsquo;, are not quoted but left
untouched in the text string. This is most useful for
writing LaTeX equations. If this flag is not set, then the
backslash character &rsquo;\&rsquo; is changed to the
\backslash command, a brace &rsquo;{&rsquo; is turned into a
brace command \{, etc.

-spel[lcheckcommand]
command

Use command for the
external spell checking program when using the spell
check/search/replace popup. The string command should
include the string &rsquo;&rsquo;%s&rsquo;&rsquo; which is
replaced by a temporary filename. Default is
&rsquo;&rsquo;spell %s&rsquo;&rsquo;.

-spinner_d[elay]
msec

The delay (in milliseconds)
before the spinner will automatically count up or down when
the button is pressed. Spinners are the (numeric) text
widgets with an up- and down-arrow, which when clicked,
cause the value to be incremented/decremented. The default
is 500 milliseconds.

-spinner_r[rate]
msec

The rate (in milliseconds) at
which the spinner will count when the up- or down-arrow is
pressed.

-startfi[llstyle]
stylenumber

Set the starting fill style for
area fill (-1 to 21).

-startfo[ntsize]
pointsize

Set the default font size for
text objects (default = 12pt).

-startg[ridmode]
modenumber

Set the starting grid mode (0
to 3). Mode 0 is no grid. In imperial (inches) mode, grid
mode 1 is 1/4 inch, mode 2 is 1/2 inch and mode 3 is 1 inch.
In metric mode, grid mode 1 is 2mm, mode 2 is 5mm and mode 3
is 1cm.

-startla[texFont]
font

Set the starting font name for
LaTeX fonts.

-startli[newidth]
width

Set the starting line
width.

-startpo[snmode]
modenumber

Set the starting point
positioning mode (0 to 4) In imperial (inches) mode,
positioning mode 0 is &rsquo;&rsquo;any&rsquo;&rsquo;, mode
1 is 1/16 inch, mode 2 is 1/4 inch, mode 3 is 1/2 inch and
mode 4 is 1 inch. In metric mode, mode 0 is
&rsquo;&rsquo;any&rsquo;&rsquo;, mode 1 is 1mm, mode 2 is
5mm, mode 3 is 10mm and mode 4 is 20mm.

-startp[sFont]
font

Set the starting font name for
PostScript fonts.

-startt[extstep]
stepsize

Set the starting text step.

-ta[blet]

Specifies that xfig should use
the input tablet instead of the mouse for drawing. You must
have the XInputExtension in your X server and an input
tablet for this to work.

-track

Turn on cursor (mouse) tracking
arrows (default).

-tran[sparent_color]
color_number

Make the transparent color for
GIF export color_number. This number is the color
number according to the xfig color panel, starting at
0 (black) and ending at 31 (gold), or may be a user-defined
color number, which is 32 or higher.

-update
file [ file ... ]

Run xfig in an
"update" mode, where it will read each Fig file
specified on the command line and write it out to the
original file, in the current file format for the version of
xfig being run. The original Fig file will be preserved with
the suffix .bak attached to the name. In this mode,
xfig exits when finished, and no window is opened.

-users[cale]
scale

Set the multiplier for
displayed line lengths etc. This factor is multiplied by the
actual length, radius or diameter of the object currently
being drawn on the canvas. It is useful for making scale
drawings, where e.g. 1 inch = 1 foot (userscale = 12.0) or
1cm = 1m (userscale = 100.0).

-useru[nit]
units

The units string is
printed with the length information when drawing objects.
For example if the userscale = 1.0 and the
userunit = ft then a line which is 3 inches
long on the canvas would be displayed as
&rsquo;&rsquo;length = 3 ft&rsquo;&rsquo; when it is being
drawn.

After
xfig is started you may change the userscale
and the userunit from a popup menu available by
pressing mouse button 3 in the units box where the
two rulers meet.

-visual
visualname

Use visualname as the
visual for xfig. The names are TrueColor (case is not
important), StaticColor, DirectColor, StaticGray, GrayScale
and PseudoColor. xfig uses the default visual unless
this is specified. Your server must support the desired
visual. Use xdpyinfo to see what visuals and depths
are supported. See also the -depth option.

-write_bak

When saving a drawing into an
existing .fig file xfig will first rename that file by
appending

-zoom
zoomscale

Set the starting zoom
scale.

Because of the
difference of the fonts shown on the canvas and the
PostScript fonts on printers, text alignment can be
problematic.

Not all
operations employ smart redrawing of objects which are
altered as a by product of the operation. You may need to
use Redraw in these cases.

If the image is
panned or the xfig window iconified and de-iconified
during the middle of an operation (e.g. while drawing a
line), the picture will be distorted. This can be corrected
using Redraw after the operation is complete.

When zoomed
very large, the length of dashes in dashed lines will top
out at 255 pixels long. This is due to a restriction in X
that the dash list is defined by char (255 pixels maximum
for a dash). The figure will print correctly, however.

When you do a
copy/rotate with multiple copies, only the creation of the
last object can be undone with the Undo button.

Modifications
to text using the popup search/update/replace/spell check
panel cannot be undone.

Version
3.1:

The only
difference between protocol version 3.0 and version 3.1 is
that the position of the &rsquo;&rsquo;magnet&rsquo;&rsquo;
has been shifted by 14 fig units. In the 2.1 and older
versions of xfig the grid was in multiples of 5 fig units,
but they were on intervals 4, 9, 14, 19, etc. When version
3.0 was created, coordinates were simply multiplied by the
ratio of the resolutions (1200/80 = 15) so values like 4
became 60 instead of 74 ((4+1)*15 - 1).

Version
3.2:

The changes to
the version 3.2 file protocol are the addition of the paper
size, print/export magnification, single/multiple page
indicator and a transparent color name used for GIF export
to the header of the file. 
The other difference in the version 3.2 protocol is the
mathematical model used for splines. The new version uses
X-splines which allows the user to mix interpolation and
approximation points in a same curve. More precisely, it
means that an X-spline curve is neither an interpolated
spline nor an approximated one, it is BOTH (the behaviour of
each point is controlled by one single parameter called
&rsquo;&rsquo;shape factor&rsquo;&rsquo;). For additional
information about X-splines, see:

"X-Splines:
A Spline Model Designed for the End User" 
by C. Blanc and C. Schlick, Proceedings of SIGGRAPH&rsquo;95

http://dept-info.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~schlick/DOC/sig1.html

Caveat: Because
previous spline models (quadratic B-splines and Bezier with
hidden points) are no longer supported, curves that are
present in version 3.1 and older files are automatically
converted to X-splines. This translation is only an
approximation process. It means that the converted curves
are not exactly the same as the original ones. Though they
are usually very close, some hand-fitting may be needed in
some pathological cases.

X-splines by: 
Carole Blanc (blanc [AT] labri.fr)

Note: the initial implementation was done by C. Feuille, S.
Grosbois, L. Maziere and L. Minihot as a student practice
(Universite Bordeaux, France).
