NAME

interface-order
- resolvconf configuration file

DESCRIPTION

The file
/etc/resolvconf/interface-order is used to control
the order in which resolvconf nameserver information records
are processed by those resolvconf update scripts that
consult this file. (The name of the file is apt because a
resolvconf nameserver information record is named after the
interface with which it is associated.)

The file
contains a sequence of shell glob patterns, one per line.
The position of a record in the order is the point at which
its name first matches a pattern.

Patterns may
not contain whitespace, slashes or initial dots or tildes.
Blank lines and lines beginning with a ’#’ are
ignored.

Resolvconf
update scripts in /etc/resolvconf/update.d/ that
consult this file include the current default versions of
dnsmasq, pdnsd and libc. (Actually they
don’t read the file directly; they call the utility
program /lib/resolvconf/list-records which lists
records in the specified order and omits the names of empty
records.)

EXAMPLE

#
/etc/resolvconf/interface-order 
# Use nameservers on the loopback interface first. 
lo* 
# Next use records for Ethernet interfaces 
eth* 
# Next use records for Wi-Fi interfaces 
wlan* 
# Next use records for PPP interfaces 
ppp* 
# Last use other interfaces 
*
