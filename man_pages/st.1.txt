DESCRIPTION

st is a
simple terminal emulator.

OPTIONS

-a

disable alternate screens in
terminal 

-c class

defines the window class
(default $TERM).

-f font

defines the font to use
when st is run.

-g geometry

defines the X11 geometry
string. The form is
[=][{xX}][{+-}{+-}].
See XParseGeometry(3) for further details.

-i

will fixate the position given with the -g option.

-n name

defines the window instance
name (default $TERM).

-o iofile

writes all the I/O to
iofile. This feature is useful when recording st
sessions. A value of "-" means standard
output.

-T title

defines the window title
(default &rsquo;st&rsquo;).

-t title

defines the window title
(default &rsquo;st&rsquo;).

-w windowid

embeds st within the window
identified by windowid

-l line

use a tty line instead
of a pseudo terminal. line should be a
(pseudo-)serial device (e.g. /dev/ttyS0 on Linux for serial
port 0). When this flag is given remaining arguments are
used as flags for stty(1). By default st initializes
the serial line to 8 bits, no parity, 1 stop bit and a 38400
baud rate. The speed is set by appending it as last argument
(e.g. &rsquo;st -l /dev/ttyS0 115200&rsquo;). Arguments
before the last one are stty(1) flags. If you want to
set odd parity on 115200 baud use for example &rsquo;st -l
/dev/ttyS0 parenb parodd 115200&rsquo;. Set the number of
bits by using for example &rsquo;st -l /dev/ttyS0 cs7
115200&rsquo;. See stty(1) for more arguments and
cases.

-v

prints version information to stderr, then exits.

-e command
[ arguments ... ]

st executes command
instead of the shell. If this is used it must be the last
option on the command line, as in xterm / rxvt. This
option is only intended for compatibility, and all the
remaining arguments are used as a command even without
it.

SHORTCUTS

Break

Send a break in the serial line.
Break key is obtained in PC keyboards pressing at the same
time control and pause.

Ctrl-Print Screen

Toggle if st should print to
the iofile.

Shift-Print Screen

Print the full screen to the
iofile.

Print Screen

Print the selection to the
iofile.

Ctrl-Shift-Page Up

Increase font size.

Ctrl-Shift-Page Down

Decrease font size.

Ctrl-Shift-Home

Reset to default font size.

Ctrl-Shift-y

Paste from primary selection
(middle mouse button).

Ctrl-Shift-c

Copy the selected text to the
clipboard selection.

Ctrl-Shift-v

CUSTOMIZATION

st can
be customized by creating a custom config.h and
(re)compiling the source code. This keeps it fast, secure
and simple.
