NAME

nbd_get_handshake_flags
- see which handshake flags are supported

SYNOPSIS

#include

uint32_t nbd_get_handshake_flags ( 
struct nbd_handle *h 
);

DESCRIPTION

Return the
state of the handshake flags on this handle. When the handle
has not yet completed a connection (see
nbd_aio_is_created(3)), this returns the flags that
the client is willing to use, provided the server also
advertises those flags. After the connection is ready (see
nbd_aio_is_ready(3)), this returns the flags that
were actually agreed on between the server and client. If
the NBD protocol defines new handshake flags, then the
return value from a newer library version may include bits
that were undefined at the time of compilation.

RETURN VALUE

This call
returns a bitmask of LIBNBD_HANDSHAKE_FLAG_* values.

ERRORS

This function
does not fail.

The following
parameters must not be NULL: "h". For more
information see "Non-NULL parameters" in
libnbd(3).

VERSION

This function
first appeared in libnbd 1.2.

If you need to
test if this function is available at compile time check if
the following macro is defined:

#define
LIBNBD_HAVE_NBD_GET_HANDSHAKE_FLAGS 1
