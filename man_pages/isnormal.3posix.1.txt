ISNORMAL(3POSIX)           POSIX Programmer's Manual          ISNORMAL(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       isnormal — test for a normal value

SYNOPSIS
       #include <math.h>

       int isnormal(real-floating x);

DESCRIPTION
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with  the
       ISO C  standard.  Any  conflict between the requirements described here
       and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017
       defers to the ISO C standard.

       The isnormal() macro shall determine whether its argument value is nor‐
       mal (neither zero, subnormal, infinite, nor NaN).  First,  an  argument
       represented  in  a  format wider than its semantic type is converted to
       its semantic type. Then determination is based on the type of the argu‐
       ment.

RETURN VALUE
       The  isnormal()  macro shall return a non-zero value if and only if its
       argument has a normal value.

ERRORS
       No errors are defined.
