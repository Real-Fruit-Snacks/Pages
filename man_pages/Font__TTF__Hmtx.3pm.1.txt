NAME
       Font::TTF::Hmtx - Horizontal Metrics

DESCRIPTION
       Contains the advance width and left side bearing for each glyph. Given
       the compressability of the data onto disk, this table uses information
       from other tables, and thus must do part of its output during the
       output of other tables

INSTANCE VARIABLES
       The horizontal metrics are kept in two arrays by glyph id. The variable
       names do not start with a space

       advance
           An array containing the advance width for each glyph

       lsb An array containing the left side bearing for each glyph

METHODS
   $t->read
       Reads the horizontal metrics from the TTF file into memory

   $t->numMetrics
       Calculates again the number of long metrics required to store the
       information here. Returns undef if the table has not been read.

   $t->out($fh)
       Writes the metrics to a TTF file. Assumes that the "hhea" has updated
       the numHMetrics from here

   $t->update
       Updates the lsb values from the xMin from the each glyph

   $t->out_xml($context, $depth)
       Outputs the table in XML

BUGS
       None known
