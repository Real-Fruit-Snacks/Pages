NAME

make.coverpg -
create a fax coverpg on stdout

SYNOPSIS

make.coverpg
[options]  

DESCRIPTION

make.coverpg
is called from faxspool(1) to generate a cover page for the
just-processed fax. It has to create a proper G3 file (e.g.
via pbm2g3(1) or hp2hig3(1) or ghostscript(1)) and output
that on stdout. If the program doesn&rsquo;t exist, or
can&rsquo;t be executed, the fax simply won&rsquo;t get a
coverpage (so, if you don&rsquo;t want a fax coverpage, do
not install it...)

make.coverpg
can put anything it wants on the page, but note that there
are certain legal requirements in certain countries about
the contents that *have* to be on the cover page, for
example, the fax phone number of the sender and the
recepient, the number of pages, or similar things.

make.coverpg
gets the informations about the fax to be sent from the
command line, in the order listed above.

If the
environment variable normal_res is set to something
non-empty, faxspool requests that make.coverpg
creates a cover page in normal resolution (98 lpi). Default
is fine resolution (196 lpi).

NO
make.coverpg program is installed by default, since
everyones needs differ too wildly.

Some sample
coverpage programs are provided in the mgetty source tree,
in the samples/ subdirectory (coverpg.pbm shows how to do it
with "pbmtext|pbm2g3", coverpg.ps shows how I do
it with ghostscript).

In this
directory, you can also find two shell scripts (fax and
faxmemo) that will take advantage of one more esoteric
feature of my coverpage programs: if called with the option
"-m ", the sample programs will
put a text file "" on the cover
page (used for short notes or such). To make use of it,
faxspool is called with the option &rsquo;-C
"make.coverpg -m "&rsquo; (the
double quotes are needed!).

OPTIONS

none

Example

A five-page fax
sent from me to my second number could result in a call like
this:

make.coverpg 5
"+49-89-3243328" "Gert Doering"
"3244814" "myself" "Sep 15 94"
"22:10:00"
