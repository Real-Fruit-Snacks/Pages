Name

qtar &mdash; a
somewhat shorter tar invocation

Syntax

qtar
[-x] [--ext|--svn] archive_file
[tar-options...] files...

Options

-x

Exclude SCM directories like
"CVS", ".svn", ".hg" and
".git". 

--ext

Sort files by extension

--svn

Sort files such that file.c and .svn/file.c are next to
each other, to yield better compression of SVN checkout tar
archives where the .svn file is often a copy of the
former.
