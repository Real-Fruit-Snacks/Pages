NAME

sd_bus_message_copy
- Copy the contents of one message to another

SYNOPSIS

#include

int
sd_bus_message_copy(sd_bus_message *m,
sd_bus_message *source,
int all); 

DESCRIPTION

sd_bus_message_copy()
copies the contents from message source to m.
If all is false, a single complete type is copied
(basic or container). If all is true, the contents
are copied until the end of the currently open container or
the end of source.

RETURN VALUE

On success,
this call returns true if anything was copied, and false if
there was nothing to copy. On failure, it returns a negative
errno-style error code.

Errors

Returned errors may indicate the following problems:

-EINVAL

source or m are
NULL.

-EPERM

Message m has been
sealed or source has not been sealed.

-ESTALE

Destination message is in
invalid state.

-ENXIO

Destination message cannot be
appended to.

-ENOMEM

Memory allocation failed.

NOTES

Functions
described here are available as a shared library, which can
be compiled against and linked to with the
libsystemd pkg-config(1) file.

The code
described here uses getenv(3), which is declared to
be not multi-thread-safe. This means that the code calling
the functions described here must not call setenv(3)
from a parallel thread. It is recommended to only do calls
to setenv() from an early phase of the program when
no other threads have been started.
