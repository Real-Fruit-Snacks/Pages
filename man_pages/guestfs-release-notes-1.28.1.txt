RELEASE NOTES FOR LIBGUESTFS 1.28

These release
notes only cover the differences from the previous
stable/dev branch split (1.26.0). For detailed changelogs,
please see the git repository, or the ChangeLog file
distributed in the tarball.

New
features 
Tools

virt-v2v(1)
and virt-p2v(1) are tools for converting from foreign
hypervisors (such as VMware or Xen) or physical machines, to
KVM. These tools were previously a separate project. The
code for both tools has been integrated into the libguestfs
tree. As part of the refactoring, virt-p2v has been
rewritten (from Ruby, now C), and virt-v2v now uses several
modern features of qemu which make it run many times faster
than before. virt-v2v(1) can import from: VMware
vCenter, VMware OVA files, local disk files, libvirt, RHEL 5
Xen. It can output to: oVirt or Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization (RHEV-M), OpenStack Glance, libvirt, qemu,
local disk files.

virt-log(1)
is a new tool for listing log files from guests. It supports
a variety of guests including Linux traditional, Linux using
journal, and Windows event log.

virt-builder(1)
has a new "--machine-readable" option to make it
simpler to consume virt-builder from other programs.

New
virt-builder(1) and virt-customize(1)
--chmod option.

virt-sysprep(1)
will now remove: systemd journals, anaconda logs, lightdm
logs, debian-installer files, apt logs, exim logs,
ConsoleKit logs, firewalld logs, grubby logs, proftpd logs,
libvirt/libxml logs, and several other log files. The
virt-sysprep "user-account" operation is now able
to remove or keep particular user accounts. (Pino
Toscano).

New
guestmount(1) --fd option, allowing you to run
guestmount captive under another process.

virt-sparsify(1)
has a new --tmp option allowing you to precisely
control where temporary files are stored.

virt-sparsify(1)
can now write to a block device.

virt-customize(1)
and virt-sysprep(1) now support adding firstboot
scripts to Windows guests.

virt-cat(1),
virt-edit(1), virt-ls(1) now support the
-m option, allowing you to override automatic
inspection of guests and instead specify where to mount
partitions (Pino Toscano).

The virt tools
now have coloured output: green for OK, red for errors, blue
for warnings.

Language
bindings

You can build a
Python distribution using "make -C python
sdist"

Ruby bindings
have switched from "Test::Unit" to
"MiniTest".

The Java
bindings are now compatible with OpenJDK 8 (Pino
Toscano).

Inspection

Oracle Linux is
returned as "oraclelinux" (Nikos Skalkotos).

Linux guests
which do not have /etc/fstab can now be handled (Pino
Toscano).

Minix is
returned as "minix" (Pino Toscano).

Architectures

Aarch64 (64 bit
ARM) support has been added.

Inspection and
the "guestfs_file_architecture" call can now
recognize arm (32 bit) and aarch64 guests.

Security

CVE-2014-0191 Network usage and entity resolution in XML
parsing

Libguestfs previously used
unsafe libxml2 APIs for parsing libvirt XML. These APIs
defaulted to allowing network connections to be made when
certain XML documents were presented. Using a malformed XML
document it was also possible to exhaust all CPU, memory or
file descriptors on the machine.

Since the
libvirt XML comes from a trusted source (the libvirt daemon)
it is not thought that this could have been exploitable.

This was fixed
in libguestfs &ge; 1.27.9 and the fix was backported to
stable versions &ge; 1.26.2, &ge; 1.24.9, &ge; 1.22.10 and
&ge; 1.20.13. (Thanks: Dan Berrange, Pino Toscano).

Shellshock (bash
CVE-2014-6271)

This bash bug indirectly
affects libguestfs. For more information see:
https://www.redhat.com/archives/libguestfs/2014-September/msg00252.html

API

New APIs 
"guestfs_clear_backend_setting" 
"guestfs_get_backend_setting" 
"guestfs_set_backend_setting"

Use these APIs to set
individual backend settings.

"guestfs_cpio_out"

Convert a directory within the
disk image to cpio format.

"guestfs_journal_get_realtime_usec"

Fetch precise journal times,
see sd_journal_get_realtime_usec(3).

"guestfs_lstatns"

"guestfs_lstatnslist" 
"guestfs_statns"

Enhanced versions of
"guestfs_lstat", "guestfs_lstatlist",
"guestfs_stat" which return nanosecond
timestamps.

Build
changes 
Libguestfs can now be built with qemu 2.x.

Add support for
packaging the appliance on Mageia (Joseph Wang, Thierry
Vignaud).

Augeas is now a
required dependency.

Flex and bison
are now required dependencies.

Internals

User-Mode Linux (UML) is no longer a supported backend
(although still available). It will be supported again once
someone steps in and fixes various regressions and
brokenness in the UML (Linux) kernel.

You can now
connect gdb to qemu by specifying
"LIBGUESTFS_BACKEND_SETTINGS=gdb"

Serial BIOS
(sgabios) is now used by the libvirt backend (on x86 only)
so that we see early BIOS messages.

For the OCaml
virt tools, exceptions are now handled and printed by a
common function.

A GCC warning
about large stack frames is now enabled by default. Several
places that used large arrays and structures on the stack
have been fixed.

There is now a
test for booting the appliance repeatedly. Useful for
finding kernel leaks. See: tests/qemu/qemu-boot.c

There is a test
for testing the speed of various qemu features such as
virtio-serial uploads and block device writes. See:
tests/qemu/qemu-speed-test.c

GCC warnings
are now enabled for OCaml-C bindings in the OCaml virt
tools.

The code for
editing files used by virt-edit(1),
guestfish(1) "edit" command,
virt-customize(1) --edit option and more is
now shared between all these utilities (thanks Pino
Toscano).

The FUSE tests
were rewritten in C to ensure finer control over how system
calls are tested.

The
update-bugs.sh script has been fixed so it should no
longer create an empty "BUGS" file if the Bugzilla
server is unavailable.

The
virt-resize(1) tests now use a stochastic method to
ensure much deeper and broader testing.

When the
network is enabled, the appliance now uses DHCP to acquire
an IP address.

If libvirt is
being used then the appliance will connect to
"virbr0" (can be overridden by setting
"LIBGUESTFS_BACKEND_SETTINGS=network_bridge=").
This enables full-featured network connections, with working
ICMP, ping and so on.
