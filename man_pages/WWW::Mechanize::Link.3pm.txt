NAME
       WWW::Mechanize::Link - Link object for WWW::Mechanize

VERSION
       version 2.16

SYNOPSIS
       Link object to encapsulate all the stuff that Mech needs but nobody
       wants to deal with as an array.

Constructor
   new()
           my $link = WWW::Mechanize::Link->new( {
               url  => $url,
               text => $text,
               name => $name,
               tag  => $tag,
               base => $base,
               attr => $attr_href,
           } );

       For compatibility, this older interface is also supported:
