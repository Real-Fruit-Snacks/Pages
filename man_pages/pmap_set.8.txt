pmap_set

SYNOPSIS

pmap_set

DESCRIPTION

The
pmap_set command can be used to restart a running
portmapper or to set the list of registered RPC programs on
the local host. If you want to use the program to restart
the portmapper you have to redirect the output of
pmap_dump to a file. After this you can restart the
portmapper and restore the list of the registered RPC
programs by feeding the output of pmap_dump to the
pmap_set command.
