NAME

fsetupcmd,
fsetup &minus; set environment variables

SYNOPSIS

fsetup [-c |
-b] host port [directory] | abbreviation

DESCRIPTION

fsetup
uses a resources files to set all environmant variables
needed to connect to a given host via FSP. fsetup
loads all available resource files. If server is defined in
multiple files, first match is returned. Load order is
.fspsites in the current working directory and in the
user&rsquo;s home directory. Then a system wide default file
is used. If fsetup is invoked with an abbreviation
given, the resource files are searched for the first host to
match this abbreviation. The values given for this host will
be set.

If
fsetup is invoked with a given host and port number,
this host will be used and no searching in the resource file
will be done.

Since programs
cannot change environment variables of their parent shell in
a simple way, it is recommended that the user defines a
shell alias or function to make it possible. csh
example:

alias fsetup
&rsquo;eval &rsquo;fsetupcmd *&rsquo;&rsquo;

FILES

For more
information about the resource file confer
fspsites(5).

ARGUMENTS

-b
-- output Bourne shell code

-c --
output C shell code

ENVIRONMENT

The environment
variables associate this program with a FSP database and are
set (resp. unset) if needed. See fsp_env(7) for list.

HISTORY

This is rewrite
of classic fsetup Perl script which was used in gold FSP era
to parse standard fspsites format used for FSP site list
exchange.
