DESCRIPTION

vmmouse
is an XFree86 input driver for mice. The driver supports
most available mouse types and interfaces. USB mice are only
supported on some OSs, and the level of support for PS/2
mice depends on the OS.

The
vmmouse driver functions as a pointer input device,
and may be used as the X server&rsquo;s core pointer.
Multiple mice are supported by multiple instances of this
driver.

CONFIGURATION DETAILS

Please refer to
xorg.conf(5) for general configuration details and for
options that can be used with all input drivers. This
section only covers configuration details specific to this
driver.

The driver will
automatically detect if the vmmouse device is present and if
it is not, it will load the regular mouse driver and
attempt to fall back to it. There are no vmmouse
specific options, but if you set mouse(4) options,
they will be passed on.

See the
mouse(4) man page for details on these options.
