NAME

gtester - test
running utility

SYNOPSIS

gtester
[OPTION…] test-program

DESCRIPTION

gtester
is a utility to run unit tests that have been written using
the GLib test framework.

Since GLib
2.62, gtester-report is deprecated. Use TAP for
reporting test results instead, and feed it to the test
harness provided by your build system.

When called
with the -o option, gtester writes an XML
report of the test results, which can be converted into HTML
using the gtester-report utility.
