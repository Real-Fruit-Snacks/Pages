NAME

rmm - remove
nmh messages

SYNOPSIS

rmm

[-help] [-version]
[+folder] [msgs] [-unlink |
-nounlink] [-rmmproc program]
[-normmproc] 

DESCRIPTION

By default,
rmm will remove the specified messages by renaming
each of the message files with a site-dependent prefix
(usually a comma). Such files will then need to be removed
in some manner after a period of time. Many sites arrange
for cron to remove these files once a day, so check
with your system administrator.

Alternately, if
you wish for rmm to really remove the files
representing these messages, you can use the -unlink
switch. But messages removed by this method cannot be later
recovered.

If you prefer a
more sophisticated method of ’removing’
messages, you can define the rmmproc profile
component. For example, you can add a profile component such
as

rmmproc:
/home/foouser/bin/rmm_msgs

Then instead of
simply renaming the message file, rmm will call the
named program or script to handle the files that represent
the messages to be deleted. The -rmmproc switch may
be used to override this profile component. The
-normmproc switch disables the use of any
rmmproc profile component and negates all prior
-rmmproc switches.

An example of a
rmmproc script that saves a message based in its
Message-ID is provided in
/usr/share/doc/nmh/examples/rmmproc.messageid. To enable it,
simply add an rmmproc component that names it, to
your profile.

Some users of
csh prefer the following:

alias rmm
’refile +d’

where folder
’+d’ is a folder for deleted messages, and

alias mexp
’rm `mhpath +d all`’

is used to
“expunge” deleted messages.

The current
message is not changed by rmm, so a next will
advance to the next message in the folder as expected.

FILES

$HOME/.mh_profile
The user profile

’msgs’ defaults to cur 
’-nounlink’

CONTEXT

If a folder is
given, it will become the current folder.

BUGS

Since
rmm and refile use your rmmproc to
delete the message, the rmmproc must not call
rmm or refile without specifying
-normmproc, or you will create an infinite loop.
