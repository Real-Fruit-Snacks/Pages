Name

apt&minus;proxy
&minus; A proxy for saving bandwidth to Debian servers

SYNOPSIS

apt&minus;proxy
[options] [logfile]

DESCRIPTION

apt&minus;proxy
is a python program designed to be run as an stand alone
server via twistd, and provides a clean, caching,
intelligent proxy for apt&minus;get, which speaks
HTTP to apt&minus;get clients, and http, ftp or rsync to the
backend server(s). apt-proxy listens by default on port
9999.

&minus;c,
&minus;&minus;config&minus;file=

Configuration file. This
defaults to
/etc/apt&minus;proxy/apt&minus;proxy&minus;v2.conf

CLIENT CONFIGURATION

Once
apt&minus;proxy is configured on a host SERVER, users
then edit their sources.list file to point to the
proxy (which uses the http protocol to serve clients), like
so:

deb
http://SERVER:9999/debian stable main contrib non&minus;free

deb&minus;src http://SERVER:9999/debian stable main contrib
non&minus;free

deb
http://aptproxy:9999/security stable/updates main contrib
non&minus;free

What path
should be specified after the server name and port number
depends on the configuration of apt&minus;proxy
(which can restrict paths and send different paths to
different servers). See SERVER CONFIGURATION
below.

Note that you
can also use the nicknames &rsquo;unstable&rsquo;,
&rsquo;frozen&rsquo; etc, but Packages/Sources files may get
duplicated, so it is best to use either the symbolic or the
code name and stick with it.

SERVER CONFIGURATION

See
apt&minus;proxy.conf(5) for details of how to set up
apt&minus;proxy to use backends near to you.

CARE AND FEEDING OF MIRRORS

apt&minus;proxy
reduces the bandwidth requirements of Debian mirrors by
restricting the frequency of Packages, Releases and Sources
file updates from the back end and only doing a single fetch
for any file, how ever many users request it from the
proxy.

FILES

/etc/apt&minus;proxy/apt&minus;proxy.conf
or /etc/apt&minus;proxy/apt&minus;proxy&minus;v2.conf

BUGS

Packages are
not compressed using gzip &minus;&minus;rsyncable, which
gives a 30% reduction in bytes transferred for binary
packages, and much greater for source and other
packages.
