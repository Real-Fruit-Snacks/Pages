NAME
       Image::ExifTool::Photoshop - Read/write Photoshop IRB meta information

SYNOPSIS
       This module is loaded automatically by Image::ExifTool when required.

DESCRIPTION
       Photoshop writes its own format of meta information called a Photoshop
       IRB resource which is located in the APP13 record of JPEG files.  This
       module contains the definitions to read this information.

NOTES
       Photoshop IRB blocks may have an associated resource name.  These names
       are usually just an empty string, but if not empty they are displayed
       in the verbose level 2 (or greater) output.  A special
       "SetResourceName" flag may be set to '1' in the tag information hash to
       cause the resource name to be appended to the value when extracted.  If
       this is done, the returned value has the form "VALUE/#NAME#/".  When
       writing, the writer routine looks for this syntax (if "SetResourceName"
       is defined), and and uses the embedded name to set the name of the new
       resource.  This allows the resource names to be preserved when copying
       Photoshop information via user-defined tags.
