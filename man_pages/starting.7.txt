NAME

starting
&minus; event signalling that a job is starting

SYNOPSIS

starting
JOB=JOB INSTANCE=INSTANCE
[ENV]...

DESCRIPTION

The
starting event is generated by the Upstart
init(8) daemon when a new instance of a job begins
starting. The JOB environment variable contains the
job name, and the INSTANCE environment variable
contains the instance name which will be empty for
single-instance jobs.

init(8)
will wait for all services started by this event to be
running, all tasks started by this event to have finished
and all jobs stopped by this event to be stopped before
allowing the job to continue starting.

This allows
jobs to effectively insert themselves as dependencies of
other jobs. The event is typically combined with the
stopped(7) event by services.

Job
configuration files may use the export stanza to
export environment variables from their own environment into
the starting event. See init(5) for more
details.

EXAMPLE

A service that
wishes to be running whenever another service would be
running, started before and stopped after it, might use:

start on
starting apache 
stop on stopped apache

A task that
must be run before another task or service is started might
use:

start on
starting postgresql
