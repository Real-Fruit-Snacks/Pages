NAME
       Dpkg::BuildOptions - parse and update build options

DESCRIPTION
       This class can be used to manipulate options stored in environment
       variables like DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS and DEB_BUILD_MAINT_OPTIONS.

METHODS
       $bo = Dpkg::BuildOptions->new(%opts)
           Create a new Dpkg::BuildOptions object. It will be initialized
           based on the value of the environment variable named $opts{envvar}
           (or DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS if that option is not set).

       $bo->reset()
           Reset the object to not have any option (it's empty).

       $bo->merge($content, $source)
           Merge the options set in $content and record that they come from
           the source $source. $source is mainly used in warning messages
           currently to indicate where invalid options have been detected.

           $content is a space separated list of options with optional
           assigned values like "nocheck parallel=2".

       $bo->set($option, $value, [$source])
           Store the given option in the object with the given value. It's
           legitimate for a value to be undefined if the option is a simple
           boolean (its presence means true, its absence means false). The
           $source is optional and indicates where the option comes from.

           The known options have their values checked for sanity. Options
           without values have their value removed and options with invalid
           values are discarded.

       $bo->get($option)
           Return the value associated to the option. It might be undef even
           if the option exists. You might want to check with
           $bo->has($option) to verify if the option is stored in the object.

       $bo->has($option)
           Returns a boolean indicating whether the option is stored in the
           object.

       $bo->parse_features($option, $use_feature)
           Parse the $option values, as a set of known features to enable or
           disable, as specified in the $use_feature hash reference.

           Each feature is prefixed with a '+' or a '-' character as a marker
           to enable or disable it. The special feature "all" can be used to
           act on all known features.

           Unknown or malformed features will emit warnings.

       $string = $bo->output($fh)
           Return a string representation of the build options suitable to be
           assigned to an environment variable. Can optionally output that
           string to the given filehandle.

       $bo->export([$var])
           Export the build options to the given environment variable. If
           omitted, the environment variable defined at creation time is
           assumed. The value set to the variable is also returned.

CHANGES
   Version 1.02 (dpkg 1.18.19)
       New method: $bo->parse_features().

   Version 1.01 (dpkg 1.16.1)
       Enable to use another environment variable instead of
       DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS.  Thus add support for the "envvar" option at
       creation time.

   Version 1.00 (dpkg 1.15.6)
       Mark the module as public.

1.22.0                            2023-09-06         Dpkg::BuildOptions(3perl)
