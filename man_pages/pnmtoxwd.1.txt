NAME
       pnmtoxwd - convert a PNM into an X11 window dump

SYNOPSIS
       pnmtoxwd

       [-pseudodepth n]

       [-directcolor]

       [pnmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       pnmtoxwd  reads a PNM image as input and produces an X11 window dump as
       output.  You can display this output with xwud.

       Normally, pnmtoxwd produces a StaticGray dump  file  for  PBM  and  PGM
       files.   For  PPM, it writes a PseudoColor dump file if there are up to
       256 colors in the input, and a DirectColor dump file otherwise.

       In an X11 window dump file, various integers can be represented in  ei‐
       ther  big  endian  (most significant byte first) or little endian code.
       Those generated by pnmtoxwd are always big endian.

OPTIONS
       In addition to the options common to all programs  based  on  libnetpbm
       (most notably -quiet, see
        Common  Options  ⟨index.html#commonoptions⟩ ), pnmtoxwd recognizes the
       following command line options:

       -directcolor

              Output in DirectColor format.

       -pseudodepth 1-16

              Set the depth of PseudoColor dump in bits.  Values between 1  to
              16 are accepted.  Default is 8 (for a maximum of 256 colors.)
