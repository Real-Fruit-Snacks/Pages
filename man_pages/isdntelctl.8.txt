NAME

isdntelctl &mdash;
control isdn4bsd telephone sound format conversion

SYNOPSIS

isdntelctl
[&minus;c] [&minus;g]
[&minus;u unit] [&minus;A]
[&minus;U] [&minus;N]

DESCRIPTION

The isdntelctl utility is
part of the isdn4bsd package and is used to configure the
sound format conversion facilities of the /dev/i4btel
interfaces.

The following
options are available:

&minus;c

Clear the
telephone input queue.

&minus;g

Get the sound
format currently in use.

&minus;u

Set the
/dev/i4btel unit number. The default value is zero to access
device /dev/i4btel0.

&minus;A

Do A-law (ISDN
line) -> u-law (userland) conversion.

&minus;U

Do u-law (ISDN
line) -> A-law (userland) conversion.

&minus;N

Set sound
conversion to do no format conversion.

The telephony
data stream comes out of the line in a bit-reversed format,
so the i4btel(4) driver does the bit-reversion process in
any case.

Additionally,
the user can specify to do A-law to u-law, u-law to A-law or
no conversion at all in the i4btel driver by using the
isdntelctl utility.

FILES

/dev/i4btel

STANDARDS

A-Law and u-Law are specified in
ITU Recommendation G.711.

EXAMPLES

The command:

isdntelctl
-g

displays the
currently used sound format for device /dev/i4btel0.
