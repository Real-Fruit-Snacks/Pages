NAME

nbd_trim - send
trim command to the NBD server

SYNOPSIS

#include

int nbd_trim ( 
struct nbd_handle *h, uint64_t count, 
uint64_t offset, uint32_t flags 
);

DESCRIPTION

Issue a trim
command to the NBD server, which if supported by the server
causes a hole to be punched in the backing store starting at
"offset" and ending at "offset" +
"count" - 1. The call returns when the command has
been acknowledged by the server, or there is an error. Note
this will generally return an error if
nbd_can_trim(3) is false or
nbd_is_read_only(3) is true.

Note that not
all servers can support a "count" of 4GiB or
larger; nbd_get_extended_headers_negotiated(3)
indicates which servers will parse a request larger than 32
bits. The NBD protocol does not yet have a way for a client
to learn if the server will enforce an even smaller maximum
trim size, although a future extension may add a constraint
visible in nbd_get_block_size(3).

The
"flags" parameter may be 0 for no flags, or may
contain "LIBNBD_CMD_FLAG_FUA" meaning that the
server should not return until the data has been committed
to permanent storage (if that is supported - some servers
cannot do this, see nbd_can_fua(3)).

By default,
libnbd will reject attempts to use this function with
parameters that are likely to result in server failure, such
as requesting an unknown command flag. The
nbd_set_strict_mode(3) function can be used to alter
which scenarios should await a server reply rather than
failing fast.

RETURN VALUE

If the call is
successful the function returns 0.

ERRORS

On error -1 is
returned.

Refer to
"ERROR HANDLING" in libnbd(3) for how to
get further details of the error.

The following
parameters must not be NULL: "h". For more
information see "Non-NULL parameters" in
libnbd(3).
