WLAN_TKIP(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual
WLAN_TKIP(4)

NAME

wlan_tkip &mdash; TKIP
and Michael crypto support for 802.11 devices

SYNOPSIS

device wlan_tkip

DESCRIPTION

The wlan_tkip module
handles the TKIP and Michael cryptographic requirements of
the WPA and 802.11i protocols. It does encapsulation and
decapsulation of TKIP-encoded 802.11 frames and optionally
calculates the TKIP cipher and Michael MIC. The
wlan_tkip module is an 802.11 cryptographic plugin
module for use by the wlan(4) module. This module is
automatically loaded if a TKIP key is configured; typically
by a WPA supplicant program such as wpa_supplicant, or a WPA
authenticator program such as hostapd. Should the
underlying network device not be capable of doing the TKIP
and/or Michael calculations in hardware, the
wlan_tkip module will do the work.
