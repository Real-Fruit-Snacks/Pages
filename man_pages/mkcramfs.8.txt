SYNOPSIS

mkcramfs

edition] [-i file] [-n
name] dirname outfile

DESCRIPTION

This manual
page documents briefly the mkcramfs command. This
manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux
distribution (but may be used by others), because the
original program does not have a manual page.

mkcramfs
constructs a CramFs from the contents of
dirname. The image of the resulting file system is
placed in outfile.

-b blksize

generated file system.

-e edition

fsid).

-i file

CramFs filesystem.

Pad by 512 bytes for boot code.
