DESCRIPTION

rendition
is an Xorg driver for Rendition/Micron based video cards.
The driver supports following framebuffer depths: 8, 15
(Verite V1000 only), 16 and 24. Acceleration and multi-head
configurations are not supported yet, but are work in
progress.

SUPPORTED HARDWARE

The
rendition driver supports PCI and AGP video cards
based on the following Rendition/Micron chips:

V1000

Verite V1000 based cards.

V2100

Verite V2100 based cards. Diamond Stealth II S220 is the
only known such card.

V2200

Verite V2200 based cards.

CONFIGURATION DETAILS

Please refer to
xorg.conf(5) for general configuration details. This section
only covers configuration details specific to this
driver.

The driver
auto-detects the chipset type, but the following
ChipSet names may optionally be specified in the
config file "Device" section, and will
override the auto-detection:

"v1000",
"v2x00".

The driver will
auto-detect the amount of video memory present for all
chips. If the amount of memory is detected incorrectly, the
actual amount of video memory should be specified with a
VideoRam entry in the config file
"Device" section.

The following
driver Options are supported: 
Option "SWCursor"
"boolean"

Disables use of the hardware
cursor. Default: use HW-cursor.

Option
"OverclockMem"
"boolean"

Increases the Mem/Sys clock to
125MHz/60MHz from standard 110MHz/50MHz. Default: Not
overclocked.

Option "DacSpeed"
"MHz"

Run the memory at a higher
clock. Useful on some cards with display glitches at higher
resolutions. But adds the risk to damage the hardware. Use
with caution.

Option
"FramebufferWC"
"boolean"

If writecombine is disabled in
BIOS, and you add this option in configuration file, then
the driver will try to request writecombined access to the
framebuffer. This can drastically increase the performance
on unaccelerated server. Requires that
"MTRR"-support is compiled into the OS-kernel.
Default: Disabled for V1000, enabled for V2100/V2200.

Option "NoDDC"
"boolean"

Disable probing of
DDC-information from your monitor. This information is not
used yet and is only there for informational purposes. Safe
to disable if you experience problems during startup of
Xorg. Default: Probe DDC.

Option "ShadowFB"
"boolean"

If this option is enabled, the
driver will cause the CPU to do each drawing operation first
into a shadow frame buffer in system virtual memory and then
copy the result into video memory. If this option is not
active, the CPU will draw directly into video memory.
Enabling this option is beneficial for those systems where
reading from video memory is, on average, slower than the
corresponding read/modify/write operation in system virtual
memory. This is normally the case for PCI or AGP adapters,
and, so, this option is enabled by default unless
acceleration is enabled. Default: Enabled unless
acceleration is used.

Option "Rotate"
"CW" 
Option "Rotate" "CCW"

Rotate the display clockwise or
counterclockwise. This mode is unaccelerated. Default: no
rotation.

Notes

For the moment the driver
defaults to not request write-combine for any chipset as
there has been indications of problems with it. Use
Option "MTRR" to let the driver request
write-combining of memory access on the video board.
