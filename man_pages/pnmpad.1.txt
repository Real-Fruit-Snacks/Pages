NAME
       pnmpad - add borders to a PNM image

SYNOPSIS
       pnmpad [-white|-black] [-width=pixels] [-halign=ratio] [-mwidth=pixels]
       [-left=pixels]   [-right=pixels]    [-height=pixels]    [-valign=ratio]
       [-mheight=pixels]  [-top=pixels]  [-bottom=pixels] [-reportonly] [-ver‐
       bose] [pnmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       pnmpad reads a PNM image as input and outputs a PNM image that  is  the
       input image plus black or white borders of the sizes specified.

       If  you  just  need to convert an image to a certain size regardless of
       the original dimensions, pamcut with the -pad option may  be  a  better
       choice.

       pnmmargin  does  essentially the same thing, but allows you to add bor‐
       ders of any color and requires all four borders to be the same size.

       You can use pamcomp to add borders of any content - solid color,
         pattern, or whatever.  For example, if you wanted to add 10 pixels of
       red
         borders to the top and bottom of a 100x100 image, you could create a
         100x120 red image (e.g. with ppmmake) and then use pamcomp
         to insert your 100x100 image into the center of it.

OPTIONS
       In  addition  to  the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm
       (most notably -quiet, see
        Common Options ⟨index.html#commonoptions⟩  ),  pnmpad  recognizes  the
       following command line options:

       All  options  can  be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.  You
       may use two hyphens instead of one to designate an option.  You may use
       either  white  space  or  an equals sign between an option name and its
       value.

       -white

       -black Set pad color.  Default is -black.

       -left=pixels

       -right=pixels

       -width=width

       -halign=ratio

       -mwidth=pixels
              Specify amount of left and right padding in pixels.

              -left and -right directly specify the amount of padding added to
              the left and right sides, respectively, of the image.

              Alternatively,  you can specify -width and just one of -left and
              -right and pnmpad calculates the required padding on  the  other
              side  to make the output width pixels wide.  If the -width value
              is less than the width of the input  image  plus  the  specified
              padding, pnmpad ignores -width.

              If  you specify all three of -width, -left, and -right, you must
              ensure that the -left and -right padding are sufficient to  make
              the image at least as wide as -width specifies.  Otherwise, pnm‐
              pad fails.

              When you specify -width without -left or -right, and  -width  is
              larger  than the input image, pnmpad chooses left and right pad‐
              ding amounts in a certain ratio.  That ratio defaults  to  half,
              but  you  can  set it to anything (from 0 to 1) with the -halign
              option.  If the input image is  already  at  least  as  wide  as
              -width specifies, pnmpad adds no padding.

              Common values for -halign are:

       0.0    left aligned

       0.5    center aligned (default)

       1.0    right aligned

              -mwidth=pixels says to pad to a multiple of pixels pixels.  E.g.
              if pixels is 10, the output image width will be a multiple of 10
              pixels.   pnmpad  adds to whatever padding the other options say
              to do to get to this multiple.  It divides that padding  between
              the  left and right sides of the image to maintain the ratio the
              other options produce.   E.g.  if  you  say  -left=10  -right=10
              -mwidth=50  with  a 100-pixel image, you end up with a 150-pixel
              image with the extra padding split evenly between left and right
              for  a  total  of 25 pixels of padding on the left and 25 on the
              right.  If the other options indicate no  padding,  pnmpad  adds
              padding  in the ratio specified by -halign and if -halign is not
              specified, equally on both sides.

              Before Netpbm 10.97  (December  2021),  pnmpad  does  not  allow
              -halign  with  -mwidth  and  adds padding only on the right when
              -mwidth is specified and the other options indicate no padding.

              Before Netpbm 10.72 (September 2015), there is no -mwidth.

              Before Netpbm 10.23 (July 2004), pnmpad did not allow the  -left
              or -right option together with -width.

       -top=pixels

       -bottom=pixels

       -height=height

       -valign=ratio

       -mheight=pixels
              These  options  determine the vertical padding.  They are analo‐
              gous to the horizontal padding options above.

       -reportonly
                This causes pnmpad to write to Standard Output  a  description
              of the
                padding  it would have done instead of producing an output im‐
              age.  See

              below ⟨#reportonly⟩  for a description of this output and ways
                to use it.

              This option was new in Netpbm 10.89 (December 2019).

       -verbose
              This causes verbose messages.

REPORT ONLY
       When you specify -reportonly, pnmpad does not produce an
         output image.  Instead, it writes to Standard Output a description of
       the
         padding it would have done without -reportonly.

       That description is one line of text, containing 6 decimal numbers of
         pixels, separated by spaces:

       •      left padding

       •      right padding

       •      top padding

       •      bottom padding

       •      output width

       •      output height

       Example:

             4 3 0 2 100 100

       One use for this is to make padding which is fancier than the black and
         white that pnmpad can do.

       In the following example, we pad an image with 10 pixels of gray all
         around, without knowing the original image dimensions beforehand.  We
       do
         this by generating a gray image with pbmmake and then pasting the
         subject image into the middle of it.

       The example uses shell arrays, such as exist in Bash, but not Dash.

           pad=($(pnmpad -reportonly -left=10 -right=10 -top=10 -bottom=10 input.ppm))
           pbmmake -gray ${pad[4]} ${pad[5]} | \
             pnmpaste input.ppm ${pad[0]} ${pad[2]} -

HISTORY
       Before February 2002, pnmpad had a different option  syntax  which  was
       less expressive and not like conventional Netpbm programs.  That syntax
       is still understood by pnmpad for backward compatibility, but not docu‐
       mented or supported for future use.
