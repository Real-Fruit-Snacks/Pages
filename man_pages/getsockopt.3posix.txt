GETSOCKOPT(3POSIX)         POSIX Programmer's Manual        GETSOCKOPT(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       getsockopt — get the socket options

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/socket.h>

       int getsockopt(int socket, int level, int option_name,
           void *restrict option_value, socklen_t *restrict option_len);

DESCRIPTION
       The getsockopt() function manipulates options associated with a socket.

       The getsockopt() function shall retrieve the value for the option spec‐
       ified  by  the  option_name  argument  for  the socket specified by the
       socket argument. If the size of the option value is  greater  than  op‐
       tion_len, the value stored in the object pointed to by the option_value
       argument shall be silently truncated. Otherwise, the object pointed  to
       by  the  option_len  argument  shall be modified to indicate the actual
       length of the value.

       The level argument specifies the protocol level at which the option re‐
       sides. To retrieve options at the socket level, specify the level argu‐
       ment as SOL_SOCKET. To retrieve options at other levels, supply the ap‐
       propriate  level  identifier  for  the protocol controlling the option.
       For example, to indicate that an  option  is  interpreted  by  the  TCP
       (Transmission Control Protocol), set level to IPPROTO_TCP as defined in
       the <netinet/in.h> header.

       The socket in use may require the process to  have  appropriate  privi‐
       leges to use the getsockopt() function.

       The  option_name argument specifies a single option to be retrieved. It
       can be one of the socket-level options defined  in  <sys_socket.h>  and
       described in Section 2.10.16, Use of Options.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon  successful completion, getsockopt() shall return 0; otherwise, -1
       shall be returned and errno set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The getsockopt() function shall fail if:

       EBADF  The socket argument is not a valid file descriptor.

       EINVAL The specified option is invalid at the specified socket level.

       ENOPROTOOPT
              The option is not supported by the protocol.

       ENOTSOCK
              The socket argument does not refer to a socket.

       The getsockopt() function may fail if:

       EACCES The calling process does not have appropriate privileges.

       EINVAL The socket has been shut down.

       ENOBUFS
              Insufficient resources are available in the system  to  complete
              the function.
