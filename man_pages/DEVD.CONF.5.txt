DEVD.CONF(5) BSD File Formats Manual DEVD.CONF(5)

NAME

devd.conf &mdash;
configuration file for devd(8)

DESCRIPTION

General Syntax 
A devd(8) configuration consists of two general features,
statements and comments. All statements end with a
semicolon. Many statements can contain substatements, which
are also terminated with a semicolon.

The following
statements are supported:

options

specifies
various options and parameters for the operation of
devd(8).

attach

specifies
various matching criteria and actions to perform when a
newly attached device matches said criteria.

detach

specifies
various matching criteria and actions to perform when a
newly detached device matches said criteria.

nomatch

specifies
various matching criteria and actions to perform when no
device driver currently loaded in the kernel claims a (new)
device.

Statements may
occur in any order in the configuration file, and may be
repeated as often as required. Further details on the syntax
and meaning of each statement and their substatements are
explained below.

Comments may
appear anywhere that whitespace may appear in a
configuration file. To appeal to programmers of all kinds,
they can be written in C, C++, or shell/Perl constructs.

C-style comments
start with the two characters &rsquo;/*&rsquo; (slash, star)
and end with &rsquo;*/&rsquo; (star, slash). Because they
are completely delimited with these characters, they can be
used to comment only a portion of a line or to span multiple
lines.

C-style comments
cannot be nested. For example, the following is not valid
because the entire comment ends with the first
&rsquo;*/&rsquo;:

/* This is the
start of a comment. 
This is still part of the comment. 
/* This is an incorrect attempt at nesting a comment. */

This is no longer in any comment. */

C++-style
comments start with the two characters &rsquo;//&rsquo;
(slash, slash) and continue to the end of the physical line.
They cannot be continued across multiple physical lines; to
have one logical comment span multiple lines, each line must
use the &rsquo;//&rsquo; pair. For example:

// This is the
start of a comment. The next line 
// is a new comment, even though it is logically 
// part of the previous comment.
