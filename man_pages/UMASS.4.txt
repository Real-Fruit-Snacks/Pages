UMASS(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual UMASS(4)

NAME

umass &mdash; USB Mass
Storage Devices driver

SYNOPSIS

To compile this driver into the
kernel, place the following line in your kernel
configuration file:

device scbus

device usb 
device umass

Alternatively,
to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following line in loader.conf(5):

umass_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION

The umass driver provides
support for Mass Storage devices that attach to the USB
port.

To use the
umass driver, usb(4) and one of uhci(4) or ohci(4) or
ehci(4) or xhci(4) must be configured in the kernel.
Additionally, since umass uses the SCSI subsystem and
sometimes acts as a SCSI device, it requires da(4) and
scbus(4) to be included in the kernel.

EXAMPLES

device umass 
device scbus 
device da 
device pass

Add the
umass driver to the kernel.

camcontrol
rescan 0

Rescan a Zip
drive that was added after boot. The command above assumes
that the Zip drive is on the first SCSI bus in the
system.

camcontrol
rescan 0:0:0 
camcontrol rescan 0:0:1 
camcontrol rescan 0:0:2 
camcontrol rescan 0:0:3

Rescan all slots
on a multi-slot flash reader, where the slots map to
separate LUNs on a single SCSI ID. Typically only the first
slot will be enabled at boot time. Again, this assumes that
the flash reader is the first SCSI bus in the system.

bsdlabel -w da0
zip100 
newfs da0c 
mount -t ufs /dev/da0c /mnt

Write a
disklabel to the Zip drive (see vpo(4) for the disktab(5)
entry), creates the file system and mounts the new file
system on /mnt.

newfs_msdos
/dev/da0

Create a new FAT
type file system. Care should be taken not to run newfs(8)
on devices that already contain data, as this will result in
the information being lost.

Many consumer
devices such as digital cameras automatically create MS-DOS
based file systems when storing information such as images
and videos. These file systems can be accessed by specifying
the file system type as msdosfs when using
mount(8).
