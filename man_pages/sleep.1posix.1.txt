SLEEP(1POSIX)              POSIX Programmer's Manual             SLEEP(1POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       sleep — suspend execution for an interval

SYNOPSIS
       sleep time

DESCRIPTION
       The sleep utility shall suspend execution for  at  least  the  integral
       number of seconds specified by the time operand.

OPTIONS
       None.

OPERANDS
       The following operand shall be supported:

       time      A  non-negative decimal integer specifying the number of sec‐
                 onds for which to suspend execution.

STDIN
       Not used.

INPUT FILES
       None.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The following environment  variables  shall  affect  the  execution  of
       sleep:

       LANG      Provide  a  default  value for the internationalization vari‐
                 ables that are unset or null. (See the Base Definitions  vol‐
                 ume  of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 8.2, Internationalization Vari‐
                 ables for the precedence  of  internationalization  variables
                 used to determine the values of locale categories.)

       LC_ALL    If  set  to  a non-empty string value, override the values of
                 all the other internationalization variables.

       LC_CTYPE  Determine the locale for the interpretation of  sequences  of
                 bytes of text data as characters (for example, single-byte as
                 opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments).

       LC_MESSAGES
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format
                 and  contents  of diagnostic messages written to standard er‐
                 ror.

       NLSPATH   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing
                 of LC_MESSAGES.

ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
       If  the  sleep  utility receives a SIGALRM signal, one of the following
       actions shall be taken:

        1. Terminate normally with a zero exit status.

        2. Effectively ignore the signal.

        3. Provide the default behavior for signals described in the ASYNCHRO‐
           NOUS  EVENTS  section of Section 1.4, Utility Description Defaults.
           This could include terminating with a non-zero exit status.

       The sleep utility shall take the standard action for all other signals.

STDOUT
       Not used.

STDERR
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

OUTPUT FILES
       None.

EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
       None.

EXIT STATUS
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    The execution was successfully suspended for at least  time  sec‐
             onds,  or  a  SIGALRM  signal  was received. See the ASYNCHRONOUS
             EVENTS section.

       >0    An error occurred.

CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
       Default.

       The following sections are informative.

APPLICATION USAGE
       None.

EXAMPLES
       The sleep utility can be used to execute  a  command  after  a  certain
       amount of time, as in:

           (sleep 105; command) &

       or to execute a command every so often, as in:

           while true
           do
               command
               sleep 37
           done

RATIONALE
       The  exit status is allowed to be zero when sleep is interrupted by the
       SIGALRM signal because most implementations of this utility rely on the
       arrival of that signal to notify them that the requested finishing time
       has been successfully attained. Such implementations thus do  not  dis‐
       tinguish  this situation from the successful completion case. Other im‐
       plementations are allowed to catch the signal and go back to sleep  un‐
       til the requested time expires or to provide the normal signal termina‐
       tion procedures.

       As with all other utilities that take  integral  operands  and  do  not
       specify  subranges  of allowed values, sleep is required by this volume
       of POSIX.1‐2017 to deal with time requests of up to 2147483647 seconds.
       This  may mean that some implementations have to make multiple calls to
       the delay mechanism of the underlying operating system if its  argument
       range is less than this.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
