PADLOCK(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual PADLOCK(4)

NAME

padlock &mdash; driver
for the cryptographic functions and RNG in VIA C3, C7 and
Eden processors

SYNOPSIS

To compile this driver into the
kernel, place the following lines in your kernel
configuration file:

device
crypto 
device padlock

Alternatively,
to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following line in loader.conf(5):

padlock_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION

The C3 and Eden processor series
from VIA include hardware acceleration for AES. The C7
series includes hardware acceleration for AES, SHA1, SHA256
and RSA. All of the above processor series include a
hardware random number generator.

The
padlock driver registers itself to accelerate AES
operations and, if available, HMAC/SHA1 and HMAC/SHA256 for
crypto(4). It also registers itself to accelerate other HMAC
algorithms, although there is no hardware acceleration for
those algorithms. This is only needed so padlock can
work with ipsec(4).

The hardware
random number generator supplies data for the kernel
random(4) subsystem.

HISTORY

The padlock driver first
appeared in OpenBSD. The first FreeBSD release to include it
was FreeBSD 6.0.

AUTHORS

The padlock driver with
AES encryption support was written by Jason Wright
jason [AT] OpenBSD.org>. It was ported to FreeBSD
and then extended to support SHA1 and SHA256 by Pawel Jakub
Dawidek pjd [AT] FreeBSD.org>. This manual page was
