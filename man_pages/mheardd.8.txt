collect information about packet activity

SYNOPSIS

mheardd [-f]
[-l] [-n number] [-p [!]port1[,port2,..]] [-v]

DESCRIPTION

Mheardd
is a daemon that collects the statistics about the activity
on all the AX.25 channels that are configured. The list
generated is available for viewing by the mheard(1)
program. The information collected is a superset of the
information normally collected by similar mheard programs
and this is reflected in the options available for the
viewing program. Logging to the system log file may be
enabled which will enable monitoring of pathalogical
conditions, for example invalid frame types and
invalid/unknown protocol IDs.

OPTIONS

logging file at program startup, this is not the
default.

to only listen on specified ax25 ports. You may give more
