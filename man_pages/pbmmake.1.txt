NAME
       pbmmake - create a blank bitmap of a specified size

SYNOPSIS
       pbmmake [-white|-black|-gray] width height

       You can abbreviate any option to its shortest unique prefix.

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       pbmmake  produces a PBM image of the specified width and height, either
       all black, all white, or a dithered gray.  The default is white.

OPTIONS
       In addition to the options common to all programs  based  on  libnetpbm
       (most notably -quiet, see
        Common  Options  ⟨index.html#commonoptions⟩  ), pbmmake recognizes the
       following command line options:

       -white

       -black

       -gray

              In addition to the usual -white and -black, this program  imple‐
              ments  -gray.  This gives a simple 50% gray pattern with 1's and
              0's alternating.

              With none of the above specified, the output image will  be  en‐
              tirely white.
