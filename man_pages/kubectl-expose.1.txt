NAME

kubectl expose
- Take a replication controller, service, deployment or pod
and expose it as a new Kubernetes Service

SYNOPSIS

kubectl
expose [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION

Expose a
resource as a new Kubernetes service.

Looks up a
deployment, service, replica set, replication controller or
pod by name and uses the selector for that resource as the
selector for a new service on the specified port. A
deployment or replica set will be exposed as a service only
if its selector is convertible to a selector that service
supports, i.e. when the selector contains only the
matchLabels component. Note that if no port is specified via
--port and the exposed resource has multiple ports, all will
be re-used by the new service. Also if no labels are
specified, the new service will re-use the labels from the
resource it exposes.

Possible
resources include (case insensitive):

pod (po),
service (svc), replicationcontroller (rc), deployment
(deploy), replicaset (rs)

OPTIONS

--allow-missing-template-keys=true

If true, ignore any errors in templates when a field or
map key is missing in the template. Only applies to golang
and jsonpath output formats.

--cluster-ip=""

ClusterIP to be assigned to the service. Leave empty to
auto-allocate, or set to ’None’ to create a
headless service.

--container-port=""

Synonym for --target-port

--dry-run="none"

Must be "none", "server", or
"client". If client strategy, only print the
object that would be sent, without sending it. If server
strategy, submit server-side request without persisting the
resource. 

--external-ip=""

Additional external IP address (not managed by
Kubernetes) to accept for the service. If this IP is routed
to a node, the service can be accessed by this IP in
addition to its generated service IP.

--field-manager="kubectl-expose"

Name of the manager used to track field ownership.

-f, --filename=[]

Filename, directory, or URL to files identifying the
resource to expose a service

--generator="service/v2"

The name of the API generator to use. There are 2
generators: ’service/v1’ and
’service/v2’. The only difference between them
is that service port in v1 is named ’default’,
while it is left unnamed in v2. Default is
’service/v2’. 

-k, --kustomize=""

Process the kustomization directory. This flag
can’t be used together with -f or -R.

-l, --labels=""

Labels to apply to the service created by this call.

--load-balancer-ip=""

IP to assign to the LoadBalancer. If empty, an ephemeral
IP will be created and used (cloud-provider specific).

--name=""

The name for the newly created object.

-o, --output=""

Output format. One of:
json|yaml|name|go-template|go-template-file|template|templatefile|jsonpath|jsonpath-as-json|jsonpath-file. 

--overrides=""

An inline JSON override for the generated object. If
this is non-empty, it is used to override the generated
object. Requires that the object supply a valid apiVersion
field. 

--port=""

The port that the service should serve on. Copied from
the resource being exposed, if unspecified

--protocol=""

The network protocol for the service to be created.
Default is ’TCP’.

--record=false

Record current kubectl command in the resource
annotation. If set to false, do not record the command. If
set to true, record the command. If not set, default to
updating the existing annotation value only if one already
exists. 

-R, --recursive=false

Process the directory used in -f, --filename
recursively. Useful when you want to manage related
manifests organized within the same directory.

--save-config=false

If true, the configuration of current object will be
saved in its annotation. Otherwise, the annotation will be
unchanged. This flag is useful when you want to perform
kubectl apply on this object in the future.

--selector=""

A label selector to use for this service. Only
equality-based selector requirements are supported. If empty
(the default) infer the selector from the replication
controller or replica set.)

--session-affinity=""

If non-empty, set the session affinity for the service
to this; legal values: ’None’,
’ClientIP’ 

--target-port=""

Name or number for the port on the container that the
service should direct traffic to. Optional.

--template=""

Template string or path to template file to use when
-o=go-template, -o=go-template-file. The template format is
golang templates
[http://golang.org/pkg/text/template/#pkg-overview]. 

--type=""

Type for this service: ClusterIP, NodePort,
LoadBalancer, or ExternalName. Default is
’ClusterIP’.
