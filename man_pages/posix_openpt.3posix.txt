POSIX_OPENPT(3POSIX)       POSIX Programmer's Manual      POSIX_OPENPT(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       posix_openpt — open a pseudo-terminal device

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdlib.h>
       #include <fcntl.h>

       int posix_openpt(int oflag);

DESCRIPTION
       The posix_openpt() function shall establish a connection between a mas‐
       ter  device  for  a pseudo-terminal and a file descriptor. The file de‐
       scriptor shall be allocated as described in Section 2.14, File Descrip‐
       tor  Allocation  and  can  be used by other I/O functions that refer to
       that pseudo-terminal.

       The file status flags and file access modes of the open  file  descrip‐
       tion shall be set according to the value of oflag.

       Values  for  oflag  are  constructed by a bitwise-inclusive OR of flags
       from the following list, defined in <fcntl.h>:

       O_RDWR      Open for reading and writing.

       O_NOCTTY    If set posix_openpt() shall not cause the  terminal  device
                   to become the controlling terminal for the process.

       The behavior of other values for the oflag argument is unspecified.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon  successful  completion,  the posix_openpt() function shall open a
       file descriptor for a master pseudo-terminal device and return  a  non-
       negative  integer representing the file descriptor. Otherwise, -1 shall
       be returned and errno set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The posix_openpt() function shall fail if:

       EMFILE All file descriptors available  to  the  process  are  currently
              open.

       ENFILE The  maximum  allowable number of files is currently open in the
              system.

       The posix_openpt() function may fail if:

       EINVAL The value of oflag is not valid.

       EAGAIN Out of pseudo-terminal resources.

       ENOSR  Out of STREAMS resources.

EXAMPLES
   Opening a Pseudo-Terminal and Returning the Name of the Slave Device and  a
       File Descriptor
           #include <fcntl.h>
           #include <stdio.h>

           int masterfd, slavefd;
           char *slavedevice;

           masterfd = posix_openpt(O_RDWR|O_NOCTTY);

           if (masterfd == -1
               || grantpt (masterfd) == -1
               || unlockpt (masterfd) == -1
               || (slavedevice = ptsname (masterfd)) == NULL)
               return -1;

           printf("slave device is: %s\n", slavedevice);

           slavefd = open(slavedevice, O_RDWR|O_NOCTTY);
           if (slavefd < 0)
               return -1;

APPLICATION USAGE
       This function is a method for portably obtaining a file descriptor of a
       master terminal device for a pseudo-terminal.  The  grantpt()  and  pt‐
       sname()  functions can be used to manipulate mode and ownership permis‐
       sions, and to obtain the name of the slave device, respectively.

RATIONALE
       The standard developers considered the matter of adding a  special  de‐
       vice  for  cloning  master pseudo-terminals: the /dev/ptmx device. How‐
       ever, consensus could not be reached, and it was felt that adding a new
       function  would  permit other implementations. The posix_openpt() func‐
       tion is designed to complement the grantpt(), ptsname(), and unlockpt()
       functions.

       On  implementations  supporting the /dev/ptmx clone device, opening the
       master device of a pseudo-terminal is simply:

           mfdp = open("/dev/ptmx", oflag );
           if (mfdp < 0)
               return -1;

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
