AUE(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual AUE(4)

NAME

aue — ADMtek AN986
Pegasus USB Ethernet driver

SYNOPSIS

To compile this driver into the
kernel, place the following lines in your kernel
configuration file:

device uhci

device ohci 
device usb 
device miibus 
device uether 
device aue

Alternatively,
to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following line in loader.conf(5):

if_aue_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION

The aue driver provides
support for USB Ethernet adapters based on the ADMtek AN986
Pegasus chipset.

The LinkSys
USB10T adapters that contain the AN986 Pegasus chipset will
operate at 100Base-TX and full-duplex.

The Pegasus
contains a 10/100 Ethernet MAC with MII interface and is
designed to work with both Ethernet and HomePNA
transceivers. Although designed to interface with 100Mbps
peripherals, the existing USB standard specifies a maximum
transfer speed of 12Mbps. Users should therefore not expect
to actually achieve 100Mbps speeds with these devices.

The Pegasus
supports a 64-bit multicast hash table, single perfect
filter entry for the station address and promiscuous mode.
Packets are received and transmitted over separate USB bulk
transfer endpoints.

The aue
driver supports the following media types:

autoselect

Enable
autoselection of the media type and options. The user can
manually override the autoselected mode by adding media
options to the /etc/rc.conf file.

10baseT/UTP

Set 10Mbps
operation. The mediaopt option can also be used to
enable full-duplex operation. Not specifying full
duplex implies half-duplex mode.

100baseTX

Set 100Mbps
(Fast Ethernet) operation. The mediaopt option can
also be used to enable full-duplex operation. Not
specifying full duplex implies half-duplex
mode.

The aue
driver supports the following media options:

full-duplex

Force full
duplex operation. The interface will operate in half duplex
mode if this media option is not specified.

For more
information on configuring this device, see ifconfig(8).

DIAGNOSTICS

aue%d: watchdog
timeout  A packet was queued for transmission and a
transmit command was issued, however the device failed to
acknowledge the transmission before a timeout expired.

aue%d: no
memory for rx list  The driver failed to allocate
an mbuf for the receiver ring.
