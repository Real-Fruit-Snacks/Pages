PHONES(5) BSD File Formats Manual PHONES(5)

NAME

phones &mdash; remote
host phone number data base

DESCRIPTION

The file /etc/phones
contains the system-wide private phone numbers for the
tip(1) program. This file is normally unreadable, and so may
contain privileged information. The format of the file is a
series of lines of the form:
[ \t]*. The
system name is one of those defined in the remote(5) file
and the phone number is constructed from any sequence of
characters terminated only by &rsquo;&rsquo;,&rsquo;&rsquo;
or the end of the line. The &rsquo;&rsquo;=&rsquo;&rsquo;
and &rsquo;&rsquo;*&rsquo;&rsquo; characters are indicators
to the auto call units to pause and wait for a second dial
tone (when going through an exchange). The
&rsquo;&rsquo;=&rsquo;&rsquo; is required by the DF02-AC and
the &rsquo;&rsquo;*&rsquo;&rsquo; is required by the BIZCOMP
1030.

Only one phone
number per line is permitted. However, if more than one line
in the file contains the same system name tip(1) will
attempt to dial each one in turn, until it establishes a
connection.
