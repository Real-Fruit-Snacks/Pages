[-A, --advertise=media,...] [-F,
--force=media] [-p,
--phy=addr] interface ...

DESCRIPTION

This utility
checks or sets the status of a network interface&rsquo;s
Media Independent Interface (MII) unit. Most fast ethernet
adapters use an MII to autonegotiate link speed and duplex
setting.

Most
intelligent network devices use an autonegotiation protocol
to communicate what media technologies they support, and
then select the fastest mutually supported media technology.
The -A or --advertise options can be used to
tell the MII to only advertise a subset of its capabilities.
Some passive devices, such as single-speed hubs, are unable
to autonegotiate. To handle such devices, the MII protocol
also allows for establishing a link by simply detecting
either a 10baseT or 100baseT link beat. The -F or
--force options can be used to force the MII to
operate in one mode, instead of autonegotiating. The
-A and -F options are mutually exclusive.

The default
short output reports the negotiated link speed and link
status for each interface.

OPTIONS

-v,
--verbose

Display more detailed MII
status information. If used twice, also display raw MII
register contents. 
Alert: If used three times, will force reading all MII
registers, including non standard ones. It&rsquo;s not
guaranteed any valid answer from PHY while PHY communication
can even hang. With driver e1000e will fail while reading
register 0x07.

-V, --version

Display program version
information.

-R, --reset

Reset the MII to its default
configuration.

-r, --restart

Restart autonegotiation.

-w, --watch

Watch interface(s) and report
changes in link status. The MII interfaces are polled at one
second intervals.

-l, --log

Used with -w, records
link status changes in the system log instead of printing on
standard output.

-F media,
--force=media

Disable autonegotiation, and
force the MII to either 100baseTx-FD,
100baseTx-HD, 10baseT-FD, or 10baseT-HD
operation.

-A media,...,
--advertise=media,...

Enable and restart
autonegotiation, and advertise only the specified media
technologies. Multiple technologies should be separated by
commas. Valid media are 100baseT4,
100baseTx-FD, 100baseTx-HD, 10baseT-FD,
and 10baseT-HD.

-p addr,
--phy=addr

Override the MII address
provided by kernel with value addr.

DIAGNOSTICS

SIOCGMIIPHY on
&rsquo;eth?&rsquo; failed: Invalid argument

If the interface is not running
(up), kernel will refuse to report its link state.

SIOCGMIIPHY on
&rsquo;eth?&rsquo; failed: Operation not permitted

Most kernels restrict access to
root.

SIOCGMIIPHY on
&rsquo;eth?&rsquo; failed: No such device

This error is shown, if the
kernel does not know about the named device.

SIOCGMIIPHY on
&rsquo;eth?&rsquo; failed: Operation not supported

The interface in question does
not support MII queries. Most likely, it does not have MII
transceivers, at all.
