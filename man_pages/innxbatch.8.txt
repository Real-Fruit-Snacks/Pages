NAME

innxbatch,
sendxbatches - Send xbatched Usenet articles to a remote
NNTP server

SYNOPSIS

innxbatch
[-Dv] [-t timeout] [-T
timeout] host file [file ...]

innxbatch
-i [-Dv] [-t timeout] [-T
timeout] host

sendxbatches
sitename host file [file ...]

DESCRIPTION

innxbatch
connects to port 119 of the NNTP server at the specified
host, and sends it the specified xbatch files, using
the XBATCH extension to the NNTP protocol. These files are
specified either from the command line or from standard
input if i is used.

Each file is
removed after it has been successfully transferred.

If a
communication error such as a write(2) failure, or an
unexpected reply from the remote server occurs,
innxbatch will stop sending and leave all remaining
files untouched for later retry.

If
authentication credentials are present for the remote server
in the passwd.nntp file in pathetc, then
innxbatch will use them to authenticate.

innxbatch
does not use itself any file locking. At worst, a batch
could be transmitted twice in parallel by two independent
invocations of innxbatch. To prevent this, it should
be invoked by a script run out of cron(8) that uses
shlock(1) to lock the host name, followed by a "ctlinnd
flush" command to flush the batch file.
sendxbatches is such a wrapper around
innxbatch. It will ensure only one instance is run,
flush sitename (as used in the newsfeeds
entry) and send to host the files given as
arguments.

As the XBATCH
extension is not a standardized NNTP command, some news
servers do not recognize it. Moreover, to accept batches
from remote peers via XBATCH, you have to explicitly enable
the capability with the xbatch setting in
incoming.conf. Instead of using innxbatch, you
may consider innfeed, or if that is not possible,
nntpsend.

OPTIONS

-D

Prints debugging information on
standard error. This will show the protocol transactions
between innxbatch and the NNTP server on the remote
host. 

-i

Reads batch file names from standard input. For each
successfully transmitted batch, an "OK" is printed
on stdout to indicate that another file name is
expected. 

-t timeout

Specifies a timeout in seconds
on how long to try to make the connection. Otherwise,
innxbatch normally blocks until the connection is
made.

-T timeout

Specifies the total amount of
time in seconds that should be allowed for article
transfers.

The default is
to wait until an I/O error occurs, or all the articles have
been transferred. If this flag is used, the time is checked
just before each article is started; it will not abort a
transfer that is in progress.

-v

Upon exit, innxbatch reports transfer and CPU
usage statistics via syslog(3). If this flag is used, they
will also be printed on the standard output.

EXAMPLES

A sample
newsfeeds entry to produce appropriate xbatch files
is:

nase\ 
:*\ 
:Tc,Wnb\ 
:/batcher -p "(/innshellvars>\ 
> /nase.\$\$)" nase.do.main

A sample script
to invoke innxbatch(8) is:

#! /bin/sh 
# Send xbatches for a site, wrapped around innxbatch. 
if [ $# -lt 3 ] 
then 
echo "usage: $0  
 ..." 
exit 1 
fi 
. /innshellvars 
site="$1"; host="$2"; shift; shift 
ctlinnd flush "$site" \ 
&& sleep 5 \ 
&& exec ${NEWSBIN}/innxbatch -v -D "$host"
$*

You can use
sendxbatches, already shipped with INN, doing
locking. An example of call is:

sendxbatches
nase remote.news.server.name /nase*
