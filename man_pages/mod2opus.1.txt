Name

mod2opus
— wrapper for tracker module/MIDI to Opus
transcoding

Syntax

mod2opus
file...

Description

Most if not all
mobile players ("MP3 player",
"smartphone") still cannot do tracker modules or
MIDI, but need a regular premixed file.

This program
wrapper converts such files (.mod, .xm, .it, etc.) to Opus
using Timidity++ or XMP. (For MIDI, timidity’s
presence is required.)
