NAME
       calamares - distribution-independent system installer

SYNOPSIS
       calamares [options]

DESCRIPTION
       calamares  is  a distribution-independent system installer, with an ad‐
       vanced partitioning feature for both manual and automated  partitioning
       operations. It is the first installer with an automated “Replace Parti‐
       tion” option, which makes it easy to reuse a partition  over  and  over
       for  distribution  testing. Calamares is designed to be customizable by
       distribution maintainers without need for cumbersome  patching,  thanks
       to third party branding and external modules support.
