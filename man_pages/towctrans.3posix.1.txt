TOWCTRANS(3POSIX)          POSIX Programmer's Manual         TOWCTRANS(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       towctrans, towctrans_l — wide-character transliteration

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wctype.h>

       wint_t towctrans(wint_t wc, wctrans_t desc);
       wint_t towctrans_l(wint_t wc, wctrans_t desc,
           locale_t locale);

DESCRIPTION
       For towctrans(): The functionality described on this reference page  is
       aligned  with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements
       described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume  of
       POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The  towctrans()  and  towctrans_l()  functions shall transliterate the
       wide-character code wc using the mapping described by desc.

       The current setting of the LC_CTYPE category in the current  locale  or
       in  the  locale represented by locale, respectively, should be the same
       as during the call to wctrans() or wctrans_l() that returned the  value
       desc.

       If the value of desc is invalid (that is, not obtained by a call to wc‐
       trans() or desc is invalidated by a subsequent call to setlocale() that
       has affected category LC_CTYPE), the result is unspecified.

       If the value of desc is invalid (that is, not obtained by a call to wc‐
       trans_l() with the same locale object locale) the  result  is  unspeci‐
       fied.

       An  application  wishing to check for error situations should set errno
       to 0 before calling towctrans() or towctrans_l().

       If errno is non-zero on return, an error has occurred.

       The behavior is undefined if the locale argument  to  towctrans_l()  is
       the special locale object LC_GLOBAL_LOCALE or is not a valid locale ob‐
       ject handle.

RETURN VALUE
       If successful, the towctrans() and towctrans_l() functions shall return
       the mapped value of wc using the mapping described by desc.  Otherwise,
       they shall return wc unchanged.

ERRORS
       These functions may fail if:

       EINVAL desc contains an invalid transliteration descriptor.

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       The strings "tolower" and "toupper" are reserved for the standard  map‐
       ping  names.  In  the table below, the functions in the left column are
       equivalent to the functions in the right column.

           towlower(wc)            towctrans(wc, wctrans("tolower"))
           towlower_l(wc, locale)  towctrans_l(wc, wctrans("tolower"), locale)
           towupper(wc)            towctrans(wc, wctrans("toupper"))
           towupper_l(wc, locale)  towctrans_l(wc, wctrans("toupper"), locale)

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
