NAME

sq key adopt -
Bind keys from one certificate to another

SYNOPSIS

sq key
adopt [OPTIONS] TARGET-KEY

DESCRIPTION

Bind keys from
one certificate to another.

This command
allows one to transfer primary keys and subkeys into an
existing certificate. Say you want to transition to a new
certificate, but have an authentication subkey on your
current certificate. You want to keep the authentication
subkey because it allows access to SSH servers and updating
their configuration is not feasible.
