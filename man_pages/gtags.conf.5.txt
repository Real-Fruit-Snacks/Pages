NAME

gtags.conf -
configuration data for GNU Global

SYNOPSIS

´gtags.conf´

´~/.globalrc´

DESCRIPTION

´gtags.conf´
has configuration data for global(1),
gozilla(1), gtags(1) and htags(1). They
look for the following files in this order, and read from
the first one that exists and is readable. 
(1) --gtagsconf file 
(2) $GTAGSCONF 
(3) [project root]/gtags.conf 
(4) [project root]/[objdir]/gtags.conf 
(5) $HOME/.globalrc 
(6) /etc/gtags.conf 
(7) [sysconfdir]/gtags.conf

[sysconfdir] is
´/usr/local/etc´ by default; you can change it
by the --sysconfdir option of the configure script. [objdir]
is ´obj´ by default; you can change it by
GTAGSOBJDIR or MAKEOBJDIR.

Its syntax is
similar to termcap(5) except for some extensions
described later. A file includes one or more records. You
should select a record using a label. Default label is
´default´. If GTAGSLABEL is set, its
value is used. Please be aware the meaning of
´default´ is different from that of
termcap(5).

Lines starting
with ´#´ are ignored. A record consists of one
or more fields separated by ´:´ and ends with a
newline. The first field must have a label name. Each field
of the rest has a variable definition. There are three types
in those variables. 
Boolean: This type has no value; existence of variable means
true else 
false. 
Number: This type has a number value after ´#´.

String: This type has a string value after
´=´.

Most variables are relevant to
string type.

If data
includes ´:´ or newline, you need to quote it by
´\’. An empty field is permitted, but it
doesn’t make sense.

When there is
more than one definition, the previous one is adopted.
Exceptionally, all values of skip, langmap and
gtags_parser are adopted and connected
respectively.

Variable substitution

Variable
substitution similar to sh(1) is available. You can
refer to any string variable using ´$´ prefix.
For example, the following b has a value
´XYZ´. 
:a=Y:b=X${a}Z:

Including another record

Tc is a
special variable; it reads in definitions in another record.
It is similar to the tc of termcap(5). Its
syntax is as follows: 
tc=label[@file] 
If only a label is given, tc is read from a
record specified by the label in the same file. If
@file is also given, tc is read from a record
specified by the label in the specified file.
File should be an absolute path, and should not
include variables. Different from termcap(5), you can
use tc anytime anywhere.

CONFIGURATION

About variables
for each command, please see each manual.

You can use the
following environment variables as a string variable. If
these variables are set then environment variables of the
same name are set before command execution. 
GREP_COLOR 
GREP_COLORS 
GTAGSBLANKENCODE 
GTAGSCACHE 
GTAGSFORCECPP 
GTAGSGLOBAL 
GTAGSGTAGS 
GTAGSLIBPATH 
GTAGSLOGGING 
GTAGSTHROUGH 
GTAGS_OPTIONS 
HTAGS_OPTIONS 
MAKEOBJDIR 
MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX 
TMPDIR

The following
variables are also available as a string variable. By
default, each of them has a directory path given by the
configure script. 
bindir 
datadir 
libdir 
localstatedir 
sysconfdir

ENVIRONMENT

The following
environment variables affect the execution of the commands.

GTAGSCONF

If this variable is set, the
value is used as a configuration file.

GTAGSLABEL

If this variable is set, the
value is used as a label of the configuration file. The
default is default.
