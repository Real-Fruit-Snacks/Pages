NAME

sane-hp3500 -
SANE backend for Hewlett-Packard ScanJet 3500 series
scanners

DESCRIPTION

The
sane-hp3500 library implements a SANE (Scanner Access
Now Easy) backend that provides access to the following
Hewlett-Packard USB flatbed scanners:

ScanJet 3500C

ScanJet 3530C 
ScanJet 3570C

If you own a
scanner other than the ones listed above that works with
this backend, please let us know this by sending the
scanner’s exact model name and the USB vendor and
device ids (e.g. from /proc/bus/usb/devices,
sane-find-scanner or syslog) to us. Even if the
scanner’s name is only slightly different from the
models mentioned above, please let us know.

CONFIGURATION

None
required.

FILES

/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-hp3500.a

The static library implementing
this backend.

/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-hp3500.so

The shared library implementing
this backend (present on systems that support dynamic
loading).

ENVIRONMENT

SANE_DEBUG_HP3500
