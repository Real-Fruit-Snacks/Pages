JINFO(1)                         JDK Commands                         JINFO(1)

NAME
       jinfo  -  generate  Java configuration information for a specified Java
       process

SYNOPSIS
       Note: This command is experimental and unsupported.

       jinfo [option] pid

       option This represents the jinfo command-line options.  See Options for
              the jinfo Command.

       pid    The  process ID for which the configuration information is to be
              printed.  The process must be a Java process.  To get a list  of
              Java  processes  running on a machine, use either the ps command
              or, if the JVM processes are not running in  a  separate  docker
              instance, the jps command.

DESCRIPTION
       The jinfo command prints Java configuration information for a specified
       Java process.  The configuration information includes Java system prop‐
       erties and JVM command-line flags.  If the specified process is running
       on a 64-bit JVM, then you might need to specify the -J-d64 option,  for
       example:

              jinfo -J-d64 -sysprops pid

       This  command  is  unsupported and might not be available in future re‐
       leases of the JDK.  In Windows Systems where dbgeng.dll is not present,
       the  Debugging  Tools for Windows must be installed to have these tools
       work.  The PATH environment variable should contain the location of the
       jvm.dll  that's  used  by the target process or the location from which
       the core dump file was produced.
