NAME

xscreensaver-settings
- configure and control the xscreensaver daemon

SYNOPSIS

xscreensaver-settings
[--display host:display.screen] [--debug]

DESCRIPTION

The
xscreensaver-settings program is a graphical
front-end for setting the parameters used by the
xscreensaver(1) daemon. It is a tool for editing the
~/.xscreensaver file, and for demoing the various
display modes.

The main window
consists of a menu bar and two tabbed pages. The first page
is for editing the list of demos, and the second is for
editing various other parameters of the screensaver.

MENU COMMANDS

All of these
commands are on either the File or Help menus:

Blank Screen Now

Activates the background
xscreensaver daemon, which will then run a demo at
random. This is the same as running
xscreensaver-command(1) with the --activate
option.

Lock Screen Now

Just like Blank Screen
Now, except the screen will be locked as well (even if
it is not configured to lock all the time.) This is the same
as running xscreensaver-command(1) with the
--lock option.

Kill Daemon

If the xscreensaver daemon is
running on this screen, kill it. This is the same as running
xscreensaver-command(1) with the --exit
option.

Restart Daemon

If the xscreensaver daemon is
running on this screen, kill it. Then launch it again. This
is the same as doing "xscreensaver-command
--exit" followed by
"xscreensaver".

Note that it is
not the same as doing "xscreensaver-command
--restart".

Exit

Exits the
xscreensaver-settings program (this program) without
affecting the background xscreensaver daemon, if
any.

About...

Displays the version number of
this program, xscreensaver-settings.

Documentation...

Opens up a web browser looking
at the XScreenSaver web page, where you can find online
copies of the xscreensaver(1),
xscreensaver-settings(1), and
xscreensaver-command(1) manuals.

DISPLAY MODES TAB

This page
contains a list of the names of the various display modes, a
preview area, and some fields that let you configure screen
saver behavior.

Mode

This option menu controls the activation behavior of the
screen saver. The options are:

Disable Screen Saver

Don&rsquo;t ever blank the
screen, and don&rsquo;t ever allow the monitor to power
down.

Blank Screen Only

When blanking the screen, just
go black: don&rsquo;t run any graphics.

Only One Screen
Saver

When blanking the screen, only
ever use one particular display mode (the one selected in
the list.)

Random Screen Saver

When blanking the screen,
select a random display mode from among those that are
enabled and applicable. If there are multiple monitors
connected, run a different display mode on each one. This is
the default.

Random Same Saver

This is just like Random
Screen Saver, except that the same
randomly-chosen display mode will be run on all monitors,
instead of different ones on each.

Demo
List 
Double-clicking in the list on the left will let you try out
the indicated demo. The screen will go black, and the
program will run in full-screen mode, just as it would if
the xscreensaver daemon had launched it. Clicking the
mouse again will stop the demo and un-blank the screen.

Single-clicking
in the list will run it in the small preview pane on the
right. (But beware: many of the display modes behave
somewhat differently when running in full-screen mode, so
the scaled-down view might not give an accurate
impression.)

When
Mode is set to Random Screen Saver, each name
in the list has a checkbox next to it: this controls whether
this display mode is enabled. If it is unchecked, then that
mode will not be chosen. (Though you can still run it
explicitly by double-clicking on its name.)

If the list has
focus, you can type any character to search within it.

Arrow
Buttons 
Beneath the list are a pair of up and down arrows. Clicking
on the down arrow will select the next item in the list, and
then run it in full-screen mode, just as if you had
double-clicked on it. The up arrow goes the other way. This
is just a shortcut for trying out all of the display modes
in turn.

Blank
After 
After the user has been idle this long, the
xscreensaver daemon will blank the screen.

Cycle
After 
After the screensaver has been running for this long, the
currently running graphics demo will be killed, and a new
one started. If this is 0, then the graphics demo will never
be changed: only one demo will run until the screensaver is
deactivated by user activity.

If there are
multiple screens, the savers are staggered slightly so that
while they all change every cycle minutes, they
don&rsquo;t all change at the same time.

Lock
Screen 
When this is checked, the screen will be locked when it
activates.

Lock Screen
After 
This controls the length of the "grace period"
between when the screensaver activates, and when the screen
becomes locked. For example, if this is 5 minutes, and
Blank After is 10 minutes, then after 10 minutes, the
screen would blank. If there was user activity at 12
minutes, no password would be required to un-blank the
screen. But, if there was user activity at 15 minutes or
later (that is, Lock Screen After minutes after
activation) then a password would be required. The default
is 0, meaning that if locking is enabled, then a password
will be required as soon as the screen blanks.

Preview

This button, below the small preview window, runs the demo
in full-screen mode so that you can try it out. This is the
same thing that happens when you double-click an element in
the list. Click the mouse to dismiss the full-screen
preview.

Settings

This button will pop up a dialog where you can configure
settings specific to the display mode selected in the
list.

SETTINGS DIALOG

When you click
on the Settings button on the Display Modes
tab, a configuration dialog will pop up that lets you
customize settings of the selected display mode. Each
display mode has its own custom set of configuration
controls.

ADVANCED TAB

This tab lets
you change various settings used by the xscreensaver daemon
itself, as well as some global options shared by all of the
display modes.

Image
Manipulation 
Some of the graphics hacks manipulate images. These settings
control where those source images come from. The savers load
images by running the xscreensaver-getimage(6) and
xscreensaver-getimage-file(6) programs.

Grab Desktop Images

If this option is selected,
then savers are allowed to manipulate the desktop image,
that is, a display mode might draw a picture of your desktop
melting, or being distorted in some way. The
security-paranoid might want to disable this option, because
if it is set, it means that the windows on your desktop will
occasionally be visible while your screen is locked. Others
will not be able to do anything, but they may be able
to see whatever you left on your screen.

Grab Video Frames

If your system has a camera or
other video input, selecting this option may allow the
image-manipulating modes to grab a still-frame of video to
operate on.

Choose Random Image

If this option is set, then the
image-manipulating modes will select a random image file to
operate on, from the specified source. That source may be a
local directory, which will be recursively searched for
images. Or, it may be the URL of an RSS or Atom feed (e.g.,
a Flickr gallery), in which case a random image from that
feed will be selected instead. The contents of the feed will
be cached locally and refreshed periodically as needed.

If more than
one of the above image-related options are selected, then
one will be chosen at random. If none of them are selected,
then an image of video colorbars will be used instead.

Text
Manipulation 
Some of the display modes display and manipulate text. The
following options control how that text is generated. The
savers load text by running the xscreensaver-text(6)
program.

Host Name and Time

If this checkbox is selected,
then the text used by the screen savers will be the local
host name, OS version, date, time, and system load.

Text

If this checkbox is selected,
then the literal text typed in the field to its right will
be used. If it contains % escape sequences, they will be
expanded as per strftime(2).

Text File

If this checkbox is selected,
then the contents of the corresponding file will be
displayed.

Program

If this checkbox is selected,
then the given program will be run, repeatedly, and its
output will be displayed.

URL

If this checkbox is selected, then the given web page
will be downloaded and displayed repeatedly. If the document
contains HTML, RSS, or Atom, it will be converted to
plain-text first.

Note: this
re-downloads the document every time the screen saver runs
out of text, so it will probably be hitting that web server
multiple times a minute.

Power
Management Settings 
These settings control whether, and when, your monitor
powers down.

Power Management
Enabled

Whether the monitor should be
powered down after a period of inactivity.

If this option
is grayed out, it means your X server does not support the
XDPMS extension, and so control over the monitor&rsquo;s
power state is not available.

Standby After

If Power Management
Enabled is selected, the monitor will go black after
this much idle time. (Graphics demos will stop running,
also.)

Suspend After

If Power Management
Enabled is selected, the monitor will go into
power-saving mode after this much idle time. This duration
should be greater than or equal to Standby.

Off After

If Power Management
Enabled is selected, the monitor will fully power down
after this much idle time. This duration should be greater
than or equal to Suspend.

Quick Power-off in Blank
Only Mode

If the display mode is set to
Blank Screen Only and this is checked, then the
monitor will be powered off immediately upon blanking,
regardless of the other power-management settings. In this
way, the power management idle-timers can be completely
disabled, but the screen will be powered off when black.

Blanking

These options control how the screen fades to or from black
when a screen saver begins or ends.

Fade To Black When
Blanking

If selected, then when the
screensaver activates, the current contents of the screen
will fade to black instead of simply winking out.

Unfade From Black When
Unblanking

The opposite: if selected, then
when the screensaver deactivates, the original contents of
the screen will fade in from black instead of appearing
immediately. This is only done if Fade To Black is
also selected.

Fade Duration

When fading or unfading are
selected, this controls how long the fade will take.

Theme

This option menu lists the color schemes available for use
on the unlock dialog.

There are more
settings than these available, but these are the most
commonly used ones; see the manual for
xscreensaver(1) for other parameters that can be set
by editing the ~/.xscreensaver file, or the X
resource database.

COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS

xscreensaver-settings
accepts the following command line options. 
--display host:display.screen

The X display to use. The
xscreensaver-settings program will open its window on
that display, and also control the xscreensaver
daemon that is managing that same display.

--debug

Causes lots of diagnostics to be printed on stderr.

The
xscreensaver and xscreensaver-settings
processes must run on the same machine, or at least, on two
machines that share a file system. When
xscreensaver-settings writes a new version of the
~/.xscreensaver file, xscreensaver needs to
see that same file, or it won&rsquo;t work.

ENVIRONMENT

DISPLAY

to get the default host and
display number.

PATH

to find the sub-programs to run. However, note that the
sub-programs actually launched by
xscreensaver-settings for display in the inline
preview pane, but are launched by the xscreensaver
daemon when run full screen, so the $PATH setting in
both processes matters.

HOME

for the directory in which to read and write the
.xscreensaver file.

XENVIRONMENT

to get the name of a resource
file that overrides the global resources stored in the
RESOURCE_MANAGER property.

HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY,
http_proxy, or https_proxy

to get the default proxy host
and port.
