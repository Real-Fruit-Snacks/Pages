NAME
       sane-ricoh2 - SANE backend for Ricoh flatbed scanners

DESCRIPTION
       The  sane-ricoh2  library  implements  a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy)
       backend that provides access to the following Ricoh flatbed scanners:

              SG-3110SFNw
              SG-3100SNw
              SP-100SU
              SP-111SU (SP-112SU)

FILES
       /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-ricoh2.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-ricoh2.so
              The shared library implementing this backend (present on systems
              that support dynamic loading).

OPTIONS
       The options the backend supports can either be selected through command
       line options to programs like scanimage(1) or through GUI  elements  in
       programs like xscanimage(1) or xsane(1).

       The following options are supported by ricoh2:

       --mode color|gray

              Color or grayscale mode.

       --resolution 300|600

              DPI resolution.

ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_DEBUG_RICOH2
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this en‚Äê
              vironment variable controls the debug level  for  this  backend.
              Higher debug levels increase the verbosity of the output.
