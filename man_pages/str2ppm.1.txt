NAME

str2ppm −
converts the captured video stream to ppm files

SYNOPSIS

str2ppm
[options] parameter−file

DESCRIPTION

Vstream is a
collection of utilities for capturing reasonably high
quality video from a v4l device (specifically configured for
bttv). A simultaneous audio track is also captured.

This utility -
str2ppm - converts the captured video stream to ppm
files. When the stream is being converted, it is restored to
the ideal framerate, so dropped pictures will result in a
slightly jerky picture, but no loss of synchronisation. (A
patch against mpeg2encode/decode by the MPEG Software
Simulation Group (MSSG) is also included to allow direct
MPEG encoding from this stream).

OPTIONS

-str

write to output stream(s)
 instead of ppm files. This option
can be used multiple times.

parameter-file

name of parameter file
(normally "str2ppm.par").

NOTES

Creates
video:.ppm files in the current
directory! The filename can be changed by changing the
root-name in "str2ppm.par". The file
:cliptab must exist. When outputting to
another stream, make sure you have enough disk space; no
space checking is done! Also, no default cliptabs/parameter
files are created, so you’ll have to make your
own.
