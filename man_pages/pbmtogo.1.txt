SYNOPSIS
       pbmtogo [pbmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       pbmtogo  reads  a PBM image as input and produces 2D compressed GraphOn
       graphics as output.

       Be sure to set up your GraphOn with the following modes: 8  bits  /  no
       parity;  obeys  no  XON/XOFF;  NULs are accepted.  These are all on the
       Comm menu.  Also, remember to turn off tty post processing.  Note  that
       there is no gotopbm tool.
