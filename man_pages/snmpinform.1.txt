NAME

snmptrap,
snmpinform - sends an SNMP notification to a manager

SYNOPSIS

snmptrap -v
1 [COMMON OPTIONS] AGENT enterprise-oid agent
generic-trap specific-trap uptime [OID TYPE VALUE]...

snmptrap -v
[2c|3] [COMMON OPTIONS] [-Ci] AGENT uptime trap-oid [OID
TYPE VALUE]...

snmpinform
-v [2c|3] [COMMON OPTIONS] AGENT uptime trap-oid [OID
TYPE VALUE]...

DESCRIPTION

snmptrap
is an SNMP application that uses the SNMP TRAP operation to
send information to a network manager. One or more object
identifiers (OIDs) can be given as arguments on the command
line. A type and a value must accompany each object
identifier. Each variable name is given in the format
specified in variables(5).

When invoked as
snmpinform, or when -Ci is added to the
command line flags of snmptrap, it sends an INFORM-PDU,
expecting a response from the trap receiver, retransmitting
if required. Otherwise it sends an TRAP-PDU or
TRAP2-PDU.

If any of the
required version 1 parameters, enterprise-oid,
agent, and uptime are specified as empty, it
defaults to 1.3.6.1.4.1.3.1.1 (enterprises.cmu.1.1),
hostname, and host-uptime respectively.

The TYPE
is a single character, one of:

i

INTEGER

u

UNSIGNED

c

COUNTER32

s

STRING

x

HEX STRING

d

DECIMAL STRING

n

NULLOBJ

o

OBJID

t

TIMETICKS

a

IPADDRESS

b

BITS

which are handled in the same
way as the snmpset command.

The
AGENT argument is only embedded in SNMP TRAP PDUs but
not in SNMP INFORM PDUs. If AGENT is not an empty
string, it must be an IPv4 address. This limitation comes
from RFC 1157, in which the agent address field is defined
as follows:

agent-addr
NetworkAddress, -- address of object generating trap

From RFC
1155:

NetworkAddress
::= 
CHOICE { 
internet IpAddress 
} 
[ ... ] 
IpAddress ::= 
[APPLICATION 0] -- in network-byte order 
IMPLICIT OCTET STRING (SIZE (4))

An example of
how to use snmptrap:

snmptrap -v 1
-c public manager enterprises.spider test-hub 3 0
&rsquo;&rsquo; interfaces.iftable.ifentry.ifindex.1 i 1

will send a
generic linkUp trap to manager, for interface 1.

OPTIONS

snmptrap
takes the common options described in the snmpcmd(1)
manual page in addition to the -Ci option described
above. Note that snmptrap REQUIRES an argument
specifying the agent to query as described there.
