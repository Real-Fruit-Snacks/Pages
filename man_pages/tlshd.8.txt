NAME

tlshd - TLS
handshake for kernel TLS sockets

SYNOPSIS

/usr/sbin/tlshd
[options]

DESCRIPTION

The
tlshd program implements a user agent that services
TLS handshake requests on behalf of kernel TLS consumers.
Using the accept(2) system call, it materializes
kernel socket endpoints in user space in order to perform
TLS handshakes using a TLS library. After each handshake
completes, tlshd plants TLS session metadata into the
kernel socket to enable the use of kTLS to secure subsequent
communication on that socket.

OPTIONS

-c or
--config

When specified this option sets
the location for tlshd&rsquo;s config file.

-h or --help

When specified tlshd
displays a help message then exits immediately.

-s or --stderr

When specified this option
forces messages to go to both stderr and the system
log. By default, messages go only to the system log.

-v or --version

When specified tlshd
displays build version information then exits
immediately.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

The GnuTLS
library provides certain capabilities that can be enabled by
setting environment variables before tlshd is
started. More information about these variables is available
in GnuTLS library documentation. 
SSLKEYLOGFILE

When set, this variable
specifies the pathname of a file to which the GnuTLS library
appends negotiated session keys in the NSS Key Log format.
The NSS Key Log format can be read by wireshark, enabling
decryption of recorded sessions.

GNUTLS_FORCE_FIPS_MODE

When set to &rsquo;1&rsquo;,
this variable forces the TLS library into FIPS mode if
FIPS140-2 support is available.

NOTES

This software
is a prototype. It&rsquo;s purpose is for demonstration and
as a proof-of-concept. USE THIS SOFTWARE AT YOUR OWN
RISK.
