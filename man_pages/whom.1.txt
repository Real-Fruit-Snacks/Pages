whom an nmh message would be sent

SYNOPSIS

whom

[-help] [-version]
[-alias aliasfile] [-check |
-nocheck] [-draftfolder +folder]
[-draftmessage msg] [-nodraftfolder]
[-mts smtp | sendmail/smtp |
sendmail/pipe] [-server servername]
[-port port-name/number] [-sasl]
[-saslmech mechanism] [-snoop]
[-user username] [-tls]
[-initialtls] [-notls] [file]
[-draft] 

DESCRIPTION

whom is
used to expand the headers of a message into a set of
addresses and optionally verify that those addresses are
deliverable at that time (if -check is given).

The
-draftfolder +folder and -draftmessage
msg switches invoke the nmh draft folder
facility. This is an advanced (and highly useful) feature.
Consult mh-draft(5) for more information.

The mail
transport system default is provided in
/etc/nmh/mts.conf but can be overridden here with the
-mts switch.

If nmh is using
the SMTP MTA, the -server and the -port
switches can be used to override the default mail server
(defined by the /etc/nmh/mts.conf servers entry). The
-snoop switch can be used to view the SMTP
transaction. (Beware that the SMTP transaction may contain
authentication information either in plaintext or easily
decoded base64.)

If nmh
has been compiled with SASL support, the -sasl switch
will enable the use of SASL authentication with the SMTP
MTA. Depending on the SASL mechanism used, this may require
an additional password prompt from the user (but the
netrc file can be used to store this password, as
described in mh-profile(5)). The -saslmech
switch can be used to select a particular SASL mechanism,
and the -user switch can be used to select a
authorization userid to provide to SASL other than the
default. The credentials profile entry in
mh-profile(5) describes the ways to supply a username
and password.

If SASL
authentication is successful, nmh will attempt to negotiate
a security layer for session encryption. Encrypted data is
labelled with &rsquo;(encrypted)&rsquo; and
&rsquo;(decrypted)&rsquo; when viewing the SMTP transaction
with the -snoop switch; see post(8)&rsquo;s
description of -snoop for its other features.

If nmh
has been compiled with TLS support, the -tls,
-initialtls, and -notls switches will require
and disable the negotiation of TLS support when connecting
to the SMTP MTA. Encrypted data is labelled with
&rsquo;(tls-encrypted)&rsquo; and
&rsquo;(tls-decrypted)&rsquo; when viewing the SMTP
transaction with the -snoop switch; see
post(8)&rsquo;s description of -snoop and the
TLS flags for more details.

The files
specified by the profile entry &ldquo;Aliasfile:&rdquo; and
any additional alias files given by the -alias
aliasfile switch will be read (more than one file,
each preceded by -alias, can be named). See
mh-alias(5) for more information.

BUGS

With the
-check option, whom makes no guarantees that
the addresses listed as being ok are really deliverable,
rather, an address being listed as ok means that at the time
that whom was run the address was thought to be
deliverable by the transport service. For local addresses,
this is absolute; for network addresses, it means that the
host is known; for uucp addresses, it (often) means that the
UUCP network is available for use.
