systemd.system-credentials
- System Credentials

DESCRIPTION

System
and Service Credentials
[1]
are data objects that may be passed
into booted systems or system services as they are invoked.
They can be acquired from various external sources, and
propagated into the system and from there into system
services. Credentials may optionally be encrypted with a
machine-specific key and/or locked to the local TPM2 device,
and are only decrypted when the consuming service is
invoked.

System
credentials may be used to provision and configure various
aspects of the system. Depending on the consuming component
credentials are only used on initial invocations or are
needed for all invocations.

Credentials
may be used for any kind of data, binary or text, and may
carry passwords, secrets, certificates, cryptographic key
material, identity information, configuration, and
more.

WELL KNOWN SYSTEM CREDENTIALS

firstboot.keymap

The
console key mapping to set (e.g. "de"). Read by
systemd-firstboot(1), and only honoured if no console
keymap has been configured before.

Added
in version 252.

firstboot.locale,
firstboot.locale-messages

The
system locale to set (e.g. "de_DE.UTF-8"). Read by
systemd-firstboot(1), and only honoured if no locale
has been configured before. firstboot.locale sets
"LANG", while firstboot.locale-message sets
"LC_MESSAGES".

Added
in version 252.

firstboot.timezone

The
system timezone to set (e.g. "Europe/Berlin").
Read by systemd-firstboot(1), and only honoured if no
system timezone has been configured before.

Added
in version 252.

login.issue

The data
of this credential is written to
/etc/issue.d/50-provision.conf, if the file doesn't exist
yet. agetty(8) reads this file and shows its contents
at the login prompt of terminal logins. See issue(5)
for details.

Consumed
by /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/provision.conf, see
tmpfiles.d(5).

Added
in version 252.

login.motd

The data
of this credential is written to
/etc/motd.d/50-provision.conf, if the file doesn't exist
yet. pam_motd(8) reads this file and shows its
contents as "message of the day" during terminal
logins. See motd(5) for details.

Consumed
by /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/provision.conf, see
tmpfiles.d(5).

Added
in version 252.

network.hosts

The data
of this credential is written to /etc/hosts, if the file
doesn't exist yet. See hosts(5) for
details.

Consumed
by /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/provision.conf, see
tmpfiles.d(5).

Added
in version 252.

network.dns,
network.search_domains

DNS
server information and search domains. Read by
systemd-resolved.service(8).

Added
in version 253.

network.conf.*,
network.link.*, network.netdev.*,
network.network.*

Configures
network devices. Read by
systemd-network-generator.service(8). These
credentials should contain valid networkd.conf(5),
systemd.link(5), systemd.netdev(5),
systemd.network(5) configuration data. From each
matching credential a separate file is created. Example: the
contents of a credential network.link.50-foobar will be
copied into a file 50-foobar.link.

Note
that the resulting files are created world-readable, it's
hence recommended to not include secrets in these
credentials, but supply them via separate credentials
directly to systemd-networkd.service, e.g.
network.wireguard.* as described below.

Added
in version 256.

network.wireguard.*

Configures
secrets for WireGuard netdevs. Read by
systemd-networkd.service(8). For more information,
refer to the [WireGuard] section of
systemd.netdev(5).

Added
in version 256.

passwd.hashed-password.root,
passwd.plaintext-password.root

May
contain the password (either in UNIX hashed format, or in
plaintext) for the root users. Read by both
systemd-firstboot(1) and systemd-sysusers(1),
and only honoured if no root password has been configured
before.

Added
in version 252.

passwd.shell.root

The path
to the shell program (e.g. "/bin/bash") for the
root user. Read by both systemd-firstboot(1) and
systemd-sysusers(1), and only honoured if no root
shell has been configured before.

Added
in version 252.

ssh.authorized_keys.root

The data
of this credential is written to /root/.ssh/authorized_keys,
if the file doesn't exist yet. This allows provisioning SSH
access for the system's root user.

Consumed
by /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/provision.conf, see
tmpfiles.d(5).

Added
in version 252.

ssh.listen

May be
used to configure SSH sockets the system shall be reachable
on. See systemd-ssh-generator(8) for
details.

Added
in version 256.

sysusers.extra

Additional
sysusers.d(5) lines to process during
boot.

Added
in version 252.

sysctl.extra

sysctl.d(5) lines to process during boot.

Added
in version 252.

tmpfiles.extra

system.machine_id

Takes a
128bit ID to initialize the machine ID from (if it is not
set yet). Interpreted by the service manager (PID 1). For
details see systemd(1).

Added
in version 254.

system.hostname

Accepts a
(transient) hostname to configure during early boot. The
static hostname specified in /etc/hostname, if configured,

directly translate to a matching udev.conf(5) or
udev(7) rules file. Example: the contents of a
credential udev.conf.50-foobar will be copied into a file
/run/udev/udev.conf.d/50-foobar.conf, and
udev.rules.50-foobar will be copied into a file
/run/udev/rules.d/50-foobar.rules. See udev(7),
