DESCRIPTION

audemo
provides an X-based window-oriented user interface to the
Network Audio System service. It allows the user to play
pre-recorded sound files, record new sound files and to
manipulate Network Audio System buckets.

AUDEMO AND THE ATHENA WIDGET SET

audemo
uses the X Toolkit Intrinsics and the Athena Widget Set. For
more information, see the Athena Widget Set
documentation.

SCREEN LAYOUT

audemo
starts out with a single window divided into several
areas:

o

A collection of command buttons.

o

A left and right level meter.

o

A volume indicator and control slider.

o

An information window.

o

An editable field containing the directory to be
searched for sound files.

o

An editable field containing a list of sound files to
search for.

o

A window containing the list of sound files that may be
selected for playing or loading into buckets.

PLAYING A SOUND FILE

To play a sound
file you must first select it from the list of files in the
file window. You can control which files are listed in this
window by editing the Directory and/or
Template fields and clicking on the Rescan
button. To select a file, single-click on the filename. This
will highlight the filename and display information about
the file in the information window. The information
displayed includes: 
Filename

The full pathname of the
file.

File Format

The file format of the audio
file.

Data Format

The encoding format of the
audio data.

Tracks

The number of tracks of audio
data.

Frequency

The frequency at which the
audio data was sampled.

Duration

The duration of the audio data
in seconds.

Text

Any text information stored in
the file.

Once the file
has been selected, you can start it playing by clicking on
the Play command button. A shortcut for playing a
file is to double-click on the file name. This will select
the file and start it playing. When a file is playing, the
Play command button is highlighted. To stop the
playing of a file, click on the highlighted Play
button. To enable the left and right level meters, click on
the Meter button before starting to play the file. To
disable the left and right level meters, click again on the
highlighted Meter button. To adjust the volume level,
use the volume slider.

RECORDING TO A FILE

audemo
can record sound files in any supported file and data
format. To record a sound file you must first bring up the
record window by clicking on the Record command
button. This will bring up a window containing the following
fields and controls: 
Filename

The name of the file you wish
to create. Unless a path is specified here, the file will be
created in the current directory.

File Format

A menu of file formats.

Data Format

A menu of data formats. Note
that each file format does not necessarily support all of
the data formats listed.

Max Duration

See RECORDING TO A
BUCKET.

Read Only

See RECORDING TO A
BUCKET.

Frequency

The sampling rate (in hertz)
for the recording. Higher sampling rates yield better
quality sound but take up more disk and memory space. Common
sampling rates are 8000 (good for voice annotations), 11000,
22000, and 44000.

Mic(rophone)

This button tells the audio
server if you&rsquo;ve got a microphone attached to the
audio input jack. Clicking this button will highlight it and
cause the audio server to boost the input gain to a level
suitable for recording with a microphone.

Comment

Text (such as a description)
you wish to put into the audio file.

Gain

This slider is used to adjust
the recording gain level.

Record

This button starts or stops the
recording.

Monitor

This button enables or disables
monitoring.

New Bucket

See RECORDING TO A
BUCKET.

Dismiss

This button stops recording and
monitoring and closes the record window.

Once you have
selected the filename, file and data formats, frequency, mic
level, comment and gain, you are ready to record. To listen
in on the audio that will be recorded you can click on the
Monitor button. This will direct all the audio
received from the audio input jack to be played on the
speaker. When you&rsquo;re ready to record, click on the
Record button. All the audio received from the audio
input jack will now be recorded into the file. The recording
will continue until you click on the Record button
again or click on the Dismiss button. NOTE:
Audio data can accumulate very rapidly, especially at high
sampling rates, resulting in large files.

BUCKETS

The Network
Audio System service provides the capability to create
server resident sound objects called buckets.
audemo allows the user to create buckets,
record into them, play from them, load them with data from a
file and dump their contents into a file. Note that buckets
created by audemo are destroyed when audemo is
terminated. These options are available when you bring up
the buckets window by clicking on the Buckets button
in the main window. The buckets windows is divided into two
areas:

o

A collection of command buttons.

o

A table of buckets currently accessible. This table
contains the following columns:

Description

The text description.

Duration

The duration of the audio data
in seconds.

Tracks

The number of tracks of audio
data.

Frequency

The frequency at which the
audio data was sampled.

Format

A code letter indicating the
encoding format of the audio data. A key to the format code
letters can be displayed by clicking on the Format
Key button.

Access

A combination of code letters
indicating the access mode of the bucket. A key to the
access code letters can be displayed by clicking on the
Access Key button.

CREATING A BUCKET FROM A FILE

To create a
bucket from from an audio data file, select the filename
from the list of files in the file window then click the
Load button in the buckets window. The first line of
the buckets table should now contain the information about
the newly created bucket.

PLAYING FROM A BUCKET

To play a
bucket, select the bucket you wish to play by clicking on
it&rsquo;s information in the buckets table. The entry you
click on should be highlighted. Then click on the
Play button in the buckets window. A shortcut for
playing from a bucket is to double-click on the bucket
information. This will select the bucket and start playing
from it. To stop the playing of a bucket, click on the
highlighted Play button in the buckets window. The
level meters and volume level can be controlled in the same
way as when playing from a file.

RECORDING TO A BUCKET

To record into
a new bucket, click on the Record button in the
buckets window. This will bring up the record window. This
record window is the same as the one used for recording to
files. Instead of specifying a filename, in the Max
Duration field, enter the maximum duration (in seconds)
of data that the bucket is to hold. Clicking on the Read
Only button will prevent other applications from writing
into or destroying the bucket. The frequency, mic level,
format and comment are used in the same way as when
recording to files. Once all of the fields are set
appropriately, click the New Buckett button. This
will create a new bucket according to the specifications
given. The first line of the buckets table should now
contain the information about the newly created bucket. To
begin recording into the bucket, select the bucket by
clicking on it&rsquo;s information in the buckets table.
Then click the Record button in the record window.
All the audio received from the audio input jack will now be
recorded into the bucket. The recording will continue until
you click on the Record button again, click on the
Dismiss or the bucket is filled. The Gain
slider and the Monitor button operate the same as
when recording to a file.

SAVING A BUCKET TO A FILE

To save a
bucket to a file, first select the bucket by clicking on its
information in the buckets table. Then click on the
Save button in the buckets window. A dialog box will
pop up prompting you for the name of the file in which to
save the bucket data, and the file format. The data format
used will be that of the bucket. Note that each file format
may only support selected data formats. If no path is given
in the filename, the file will be created in the current
directory. Clicking on Ok or pressing the
RETURN key will cause the file to be created and the
data from the bucket to be written to the file.

DELETING A BUCKET

To delete a
bucket, first select the bucket by clicking on it&rsquo;s
information in the buckets table. Then click on the
Delete button in the buckets window. If the
audemo has the appropriate access permissions for the
bucket, the bucket will be deleted and it&rsquo;s
information will be removed from the bucket table.

EXITING AUDEMO

Clicking on the
Quit button will cause audemo to exit,
stopping any playing or recording operations and destroying
any buckets that were created.

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS

-audio
servername

This option specifies the
Network Audio System server to which audemo should
connect.

directory

The directory name that
audemo will use to build the list of selectable file
names. When directory is not specified on the command
line, the current working directory is used.

EXAMPLES

In the
following example, in a TCP/IP network,
mcxterm is the name of the desktop machine running
the audio server. The default port is 8000 and sound
files are located in ~/snd:

audemo -audio
tcp/mcxterm:8000 ~/snd

In the
following example, the shortened form of the audio server
name is used and sound files from the current working
directory will be used:

audemo -audio
mcxterm:0

ENVIRONMENT

In addition to
the standard toolkit environment variables, the following
environment variables are used by audemo: 
AUDIOSERVER

This variable specifies the
default audio server to contact if -audio is not
specified on the command line. If this variable is not set
and the -audio is not specified on the command line,
audemo will attempt to connect to the audio server
running on the X Window System display.

BUGS

Warning: audemo
is the xterm of the Network Audio System. It was written to
test features as the Network Audio System was being
developed. It was also the author&rsquo;s first Xt program.
Consequently, it&rsquo;s pretty ugly and should be
completely re-written from scratch.
