NAME

audit2why
&minus; Translates SELinux audit messages into a description
of why the access was denied

SYNOPSIS

audit2why
[options]

OPTIONS

&minus;&minus;help

Print a short usage message

&minus;p

Specify an alternate policy
file.

DESCRIPTION

This utility
processes SELinux audit messages from standard input and and
reports which component of the policy caused each permission
denial based on the specified policy file if the -p option
was used or the active policy otherwise. There are three
possible causes: 1) a missing or disabled TE allow rule, 2)
a constraint violation, or 3) a missing role allow rule. In
the first case, the TE allow rule may exist in the policy
but may be disabled due to boolean settings. See
booleans(8). If the allow rule is not present at all,
it can be generated via audit2allow(1). In the second
case, a constraint is being violated; see policy/constraints
or policy/mls to identify the particular constraint.
Typically, this can be resolved by adding a type attribute
to the domain. In the third case, a role transition was
attempted but no allow rule existed for the role pair. This
can be resolved by adding an allow rule for the role pair to
the policy.

EXAMPLE

$
/usr/sbin/audit2why 

type=KERNEL
msg=audit(1115316408.926:336418): avc: denied { getattr }
for path=/home/sds dev=hda5 ino=1175041
scontext=root:secadm_r:secadm_t:s0-s9:c0.c127
tcontext=user_u:object_r:user_home_dir_t:s0 tclass=dir 
Was caused by: 
Missing or disabled TE allow rule. 
Allow rules may exist but be disabled by boolean settings;
check boolean settings. 
You can see the necessary allow rules by running audit2allow
with this audit message as input.

type=KERNEL
msg=audit(1115320071.648:606858): avc: denied { append } for
name=.bash_history dev=hda5 ino=1175047
scontext=user_u:user_r:user_t:s1-s9:c0.c127
tcontext=user_u:object_r:user_home_t:s0 tclass=file 
Was caused by: 
Constraint violation. 
Check policy/constraints. 
Typically, you just need to add a type attribute to the
domain to satisfy the constraint.
