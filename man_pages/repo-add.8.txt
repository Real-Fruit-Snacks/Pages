NAME

repo-add -
package database maintenance utility

SYNOPSIS

repo-add
[options]  
[ ...]

repo-remove
[options]  
[ ...]

DESCRIPTION

repo-add
and repo-remove are two scripts to help build a
package database for packages built with makepkg(8)
and installed with pacman(8).

repo-add
will update a package database by reading a built package
file. Multiple packages to add can be specified on the
command line.

If a matching
“.sig” file is found alongside a package file,
the signature will automatically be embedded into the
database.

repo-remove
will update a package database by removing the package name
specified on the command line. Multiple packages to remove
can be specified on the command line.

A package
database is a tar file, optionally compressed. Valid
extensions are “.db” followed by an archive
extension of “.tar”, “.tar.gz”,
“.tar.bz2”, “.tar.xz”, or
“.tar.Z”. The file does not need to exist, but
all parent directories must exist.

COMMON OPTIONS

-q,
--quiet

Force this program to keep
quiet and run silently except for warning and error
messages.

-s,
--sign

Generate a PGP signature file
using GnuPG. This will execute gpg --detach-sign --use-agent
on the generated database to generate a detached signature
file, using the GPG agent if it is available. The signature
file will be the entire filename of the database with a
“.sig” extension.

-k,
--key 

Specify a key to use when
signing packages. Can also be specified using the GPGKEY
environmental variable. If not specified in either location,
the default key from the keyring will be used.

-v,
--verify

Verify the PGP signature of the
database before updating the database. If the signature is
invalid, an error is produced and the update does not
proceed.

--nocolor

Remove color from
repo-add and repo-remove output.

REPO-ADD OPTIONS

-n,
--new

Only add packages that are not
already in the database. Warnings will be printed upon
detection of existing packages, but they will not be
re-added.

-R,
--remove

Remove old package files from
the disk when updating their entry in the database.

EXAMPLE

repo-add
foo.db.tar.xz  [ ...]

This creates
two separate databases; a smaller database
“foo.db.tar.xz” used by pacman and a large
database containing package file lists
“foo.files.tar.xz” for use by other utilities.
While pacman can use the large database (if renamed with a
db.tar* extension), there is currently no additional benefit
for the larger download.

BUGS

Bugs? You must
be kidding; there are no bugs in this software. But if we
happen to be wrong, submit a bug report with as much detail
as possible at the Arch Linux Bug Tracker in the Pacman
section.
