NAME

mhpath - print
full pathnames of nmh messages and folders

SYNOPSIS

mhpath

[-help] [-version]
[+folder] [msgs]

DESCRIPTION

mhpath
expands and sorts the message list ’msgs’ and
writes the full pathnames of the messages to the standard
output, separated by newlines. If no ’msgs’ are
specified, mhpath outputs the current mail
folder’s pathname instead. If the only argument is
’+’, your nmh “Path” is
output; this can be useful in shell scripts.

In contrast
with other nmh commands, a message argument to
mhpath may often be intended for writing. Because of
this:

1)

the name “new” has been added to
mhpath’s list of reserved message names (the
others are “first”, “last”,
“prev”, “next”, “cur”,
and “all”). The new message is equivalent to the
message after the last message in a folder (and equivalent
to 1 in a folder without messages). The “new”
message may not be used as part of a message range.

2)

Within a message list, the following designations may
refer to messages that do not exist: a single numeric
message name, the single message name “cur”, and
(obviously) the single message name “new”. All
other message designations must refer to at least one
existing message, if the folder contains messages.

3)

An empty folder is not, in itself, an error.

A message
number less than that of the smallest existing message in a
folder is treated as if the message already exists. A
message number greater than that of the highest existing
message in a folder causes an “out of range”
error message to be displayed.

As part of a
range designation that contains messages that do exist,
message numbers less than the smallest, or greater than the
highest, existing message in a folder are ignored.

Examples: The
current folder foo contains messages 3 5 6. Cur is 4.

$ mhpath 
/r/phyl/Mail/foo

$ mhpath all

/r/phyl/Mail/foo/3 
/r/phyl/Mail/foo/5 
/r/phyl/Mail/foo/6

$ mhpath 2001

mhpath: message 2001 out of range 1-6

$ mhpath 1-2001

/r/phyl/Mail/foo/3 
/r/phyl/Mail/foo/5 
/r/phyl/Mail/foo/6

$ mhpath new

/r/phyl/Mail/foo/7

$ mhpath last
new 
/r/phyl/Mail/foo/6 
/r/phyl/Mail/foo/7

$ mhpath
last-new 
mhpath: bad message list last-new

$ mhpath cur

/r/phyl/Mail/foo/4

$ mhpath 1-2

mhpath: no messages in range 1-2

$ mhpath
first:2 
/r/phyl/Mail/foo/3 
/r/phyl/Mail/foo/5

$ mhpath 1 2

/r/phyl/Mail/foo/1 
/r/phyl/Mail/foo/2

mhpath
is also useful in backquoted operations:

$ cd `mhpath
+inbox`

$ echo `mhpath
+` 
/r/phyl/Mail

Because
mhpath expands and sorts [msgs]. the
command

mv `mhpath 501
500`

to will not
move 501 to 500; quite the reverse. But

mv `mhpath 501`
`mhpath 500`

will do the
trick.

Out-of-range
message 0 produces a different error message than large
out-of-range message numbers. But both cause mhpath
to exit with non-zero status.
