NAME

pmNameInDom
- translate an instance identifier into an instance name

C SYNOPSIS

#include

int
pmNameInDom(pmInDom indom, int
inst, char **name);

cc ...
-lpcp

DESCRIPTION

For the
instance domain indom, in the current Performance
Metrics Application Programming Interface (PMAPI) context,
locate the instance with the internal instance identifier
given by inst, and return the full external instance
identification via name.

The value for
the instance domain indom is typically extracted from
a pmDesc structure, following a call to
pmLookupDesc(3) for a particular performance
metric.

The space for
the value of name will have been allocated in
pmNameInDom with malloc(3), and it is the
responsibility of the caller to free(3) the space
when it is no longer required.

pmNameInDom
returns zero on success.

DIAGNOSTICS

PM_ERR_INDOM

indom is not a valid
instance domain identifier

PM_ERR_INST

The instance identifier
inst is not known for the instance domain
indom in the current PMAPI context
