FCHOWN(3POSIX)             POSIX Programmer's Manual            FCHOWN(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       fchown — change owner and group of a file

SYNOPSIS
       #include <unistd.h>

       int fchown(int fildes, uid_t owner, gid_t group);

DESCRIPTION
       The fchown() function shall be equivalent to chown()  except  that  the
       file  whose  owner  and  group are changed is specified by the file de‐
       scriptor fildes.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, fchown()  shall  return  0.  Otherwise,  it
       shall return -1 and set errno to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The fchown() function shall fail if:

       EBADF  The fildes argument is not an open file descriptor.

       EPERM  The  effective  user  ID does not match the owner of the file or
              the  process  does   not   have   appropriate   privileges   and
              _POSIX_CHOWN_RESTRICTED  indicates  that  such  privilege is re‐
              quired.

       EROFS  The file referred to by fildes resides on a read-only file  sys‐
              tem.

       The fchown() function may fail if:

       EINVAL The  owner or group ID is not a value supported by the implemen‐
              tation.  The fildes argument refers to a pipe or  socket  or  an
              fattach()-ed  STREAM  and the implementation disallows execution
              of fchown() on a pipe.

       EIO    A physical I/O error has occurred.

       EINTR  The fchown() function was interrupted  by  a  signal  which  was
              caught.

EXAMPLES
   Changing the Current Owner of a File
       The  following  example  shows  how to change the owner of a file named
       /home/cnd/mod1 to ``jones'' and the group to ``cnd''.

       The numeric value for the user ID is obtained by extracting the user ID
       from  the user database entry associated with ``jones''. Similarly, the
       numeric value for the group ID is obtained by extracting the  group  ID
       from the group database entry associated with ``cnd''. This example as‐
       sumes the calling program has appropriate privileges.

           #include <sys/types.h>
           #include <unistd.h>
           #include <fcntl.h>
           #include <pwd.h>
           #include <grp.h>

           struct passwd *pwd;
           struct group  *grp;
           int            fildes;
           ...
           fildes = open("/home/cnd/mod1", O_RDWR);
           pwd = getpwnam("jones");
           grp = getgrnam("cnd");
           fchown(fildes, pwd->pw_uid, grp->gr_gid);
