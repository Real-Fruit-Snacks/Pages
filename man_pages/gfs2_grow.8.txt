NAME

gfs2_grow -
Expand a GFS2 filesystem

SYNOPSIS

gfs2_grow
[OPTION]...
DEVICE|MOUNTPOINT>...

DESCRIPTION

gfs2_grow
expands a GFS2 filesystem after the device upon which the
filesystem resides has also been expanded. gfs2_grow
expands the GFS2 filesystem to utilize any unused space
between the current end of the filesystem and the end of the
block device. When this operation is complete, the resource
group index for the filesystem is updated so that all nodes
in the cluster can use the extra storage space that has been
added.

See
lvmlockd(8) for the procedure to extend and refresh
the logical volume prior to running gfs2_grow.

The
DEVICE or MOUNTPOINT arguments must be paths
to mounted filesystems; expansion of unmounted filesystems
is not supported. gfs2_grow need only be run on one
node in the cluster. The other nodes will see the expansion
has occurred and automatically start to use the newly
available space.

gfs2_grow
must be run as the superuser. When the filesystem cannot be
resized due to detected errors, gfs2_grow will leave
the filesystem in a consistent state.

OPTIONS

-D

Print out debugging information
about the filesystem layout.

-h

Prints out a short usage message and exits.

-q

Be quiet. Don&rsquo;t print anything.

-T

Test. Do all calculations, but do not write any data to
the disk and do not expand the filesystem. This is used to
discover what the tool would have done were it run without
this flag. This option can be used to display the current
state of a mounted GFS2 filesystem.

-V

Version. Print out version information, then exit.

NOTES

Shrinking GFS2
filesystems is currently unsupported.
