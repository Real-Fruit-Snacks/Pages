PPP(8) BSD System Manager’s Manual PPP(8)

NAME

ppp — Point to
Point Protocol (a.k.a. user-ppp)

SYNOPSIS

ppp
[−mode] [−nat]
[−quiet] [−unitN]
[system ...]

DESCRIPTION

This is a user process
PPP software package. Normally, PPP is
implemented as a part of the kernel (e.g., as managed by
pppd(8)) and it’s thus somewhat hard to debug and/or
modify its behaviour. However, in this implementation
PPP is done as a user process with the help of the
tunnel device driver (tun).

The
−nat flag does the equivalent of a
’’nat enable yes’’, enabling
ppp’s network address translation features.
This allows ppp to act as a NAT or masquerading
engine for all machines on an internal LAN. Refer to
libalias(3) for details on the technical side of the NAT
engine. Refer to the NETWORK ADDRESS TRANSLATION (PACKET
ALIASING) section of this manual page for details on how
to configure NAT in ppp.

The
−quiet flag tells ppp to be silent at
startup rather than displaying the mode and interface to
standard output.

The
−unit flag tells ppp to only attempt to
open /dev/tunN. Normally, ppp will start with
a value of 0 for N, and keep trying to open a tunnel
device by incrementing the value of N by one each
time until it succeeds. If it fails three times in a row
because the device file is missing, it gives up.

The following
modes are understood by ppp:

−auto

ppp opens the tun
interface, configures it then goes into the background. The
link isn’t brought up until outgoing data is detected
on the tun interface at which point ppp attempts to
bring up the link. Packets received (including the first
one) while ppp is trying to bring the link up will
remain queued for a default of 2 minutes. See the
’’set choked’’ command below.

In
−auto mode, at least one
’’system’’ must be given on the
command line (see below) and a ’’set
ifaddr’’ must be done in the system profile that
specifies a peer IP address to use when configuring the
interface. Something like
’’10.0.0.1/0’’ is usually
appropriate. See the ’’pmdemand’’
system in /usr/share/examples/ppp/ppp.conf.sample for
an example.

−background

Here, ppp attempts to
establish a connection with the peer immediately. If it
succeeds, ppp goes into the background and the parent
process returns an exit code of 0. If it fails, ppp
exits with a non-zero result.

−foreground

In foreground mode, ppp
attempts to establish a connection with the peer
immediately, but never becomes a daemon. The link is created
in background mode. This is useful if you wish to control
ppp’s invocation from another process.

−direct

This is used for communicating
over an already established connection, usually when
receiving incoming connections accepted by getty(8).
ppp ignores the ’’set
device’’ line and uses descriptor 0 as the link.
ppp will also ignore any configured chat scripts
unless the ’’force-scripts’’ option
has been enabled.

If callback is
configured, ppp will use the ’’set
device’’ information when dialing back.

−dedicated

This option is designed for
machines connected with a dedicated wire. ppp will
always keep the device open and will ignore any configured
chat scripts unless the
’’force-scripts’’ option has been
enabled.

−ddial

This mode is equivalent to
−auto mode except that ppp will bring
the link back up any time it’s dropped for any
reason.

−interactive

This is a no-op, and gives the
same behaviour as if none of the above modes have been
specified. ppp loads any sections specified on the
command line then provides an interactive prompt.

One or more
configuration entries or systems (as specified in
/etc/ppp/ppp.conf) may also be specified on the
command line. ppp will read the
’’default’’ system from
/etc/ppp/ppp.conf at startup, followed by each of the
systems specified on the command line.

Major Features

Provides an interactive user
interface.  Using its command mode, the user can
easily enter commands to establish the connection with the
remote end, check the status of connection and close the
connection. All functions can also be optionally password
protected for security.

Supports both
manual and automatic dialing.  Interactive mode has
a ’’term’’ command which enables you
to talk to the device directly. When you are connected to
the remote peer and it starts to talk PPP, ppp
detects it and switches to packet mode automatically. Once
you have determined the proper sequence for connecting with
the remote host, you can write a chat script to define the
necessary dialing and login procedure for later
convenience.

Supports
on-demand dialup capability.  By using
−auto mode, ppp will act as a daemon and
wait for a packet to be sent over the PPP link. When
this happens, the daemon automatically dials and establishes
the connection. In almost the same manner
−ddial mode (direct-dial mode) also
automatically dials and establishes the connection. However,
it differs in that it will dial the remote site any time it
detects the link is down, even if there are no packets to be
sent. This mode is useful for full-time connections where we
worry less about line charges and more about being connected
full time. A third −dedicated mode is also
available. This mode is targeted at a dedicated link between
two machines. ppp will never voluntarily quit from
dedicated mode - you must send it the ’’quit
all’’ command via its diagnostic socket. A
SIGHUP will force an LCP renegotiation, and a SIGTERM will
force it to exit.

Supports
client callback.  ppp can use either the standard
LCP callback protocol or the Microsoft CallBack Control
Protocol
(ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/developr/rfc/cbcp.txt).

Supports NAT
or packet aliasing.  Packet aliasing (a.k.a. IP
masquerading) allows computers on a private, unregistered
network to access the Internet. The PPP host acts as
a masquerading gateway. IP addresses as well as TCP and UDP
port numbers are NAT’d for outgoing packets and
de-NAT’d for returning packets.

Supports
background PPP connections.  In background mode, if
ppp successfully establishes the connection, it will
become a daemon. Otherwise, it will exit with an error. This
allows the setup of scripts that wish to execute certain
commands only if the connection is successfully
established.

Supports
server-side PPP connections.  In direct mode,
ppp acts as server which accepts incoming PPP
connections on stdin/stdout.

Supports PAP
and CHAP (rfc 1994, 2433 and 2759) authentication. 
With PAP or CHAP, it is possible to skip the Unix style
login(1) procedure, and use the PPP protocol for
authentication instead. If the peer requests Microsoft CHAP
authentication and ppp is compiled with DES support,
an appropriate MD4/DES response will be made.

Supports
RADIUS (rfc 2138 & 2548) authentication.  An
extension to PAP and CHAP, Remote Access
Dial In User Service allows
authentication information to be stored in a central or
distributed database along with various per-user framed
connection characteristics. If libradius(3) is available at
compile time, ppp will use it to make RADIUS
requests when configured to do so.

Supports
Proxy Arp.  ppp can be configured to make one or
more proxy arp entries on behalf of the peer. This allows
routing from the peer to the LAN without configuring each
machine on that LAN.

Supports
packet filtering.  User can define four kinds of
filters: the in filter for incoming packets, the
out filter for outgoing packets, the dial
filter to define a dialing trigger packet and the
alive filter for keeping a connection alive with the
trigger packet.

Tunnel driver
supports bpf.  The user can use tcpdump(1) to check
the packet flow over the PPP link.

Supports PPP
over TCP and PPP over UDP.  If a device name is
specified as host:port

[/tcp|udp], ppp will open a TCP or UDP connection
for transporting data rather than using a conventional
serial device. UDP connections force ppp into
synchronous mode.

Supports PPP
over ISDN.  If ppp is given a raw B-channel
i4b device to open as a link, it’s able to talk to the
isdnd(8) daemon to establish an ISDN connection.

Supports PPP
over Ethernet (rfc 2516).  If ppp is given a
device specification of the format PPPoE:iface

[:provider] and if netgraph(4) is available,
ppp will attempt talk PPP over Ethernet to
provider using the iface network
interface.

On systems that
do not support netgraph(4), an external program such as
pppoed(8) may be used.

Supports IETF
draft Predictor-1 (rfc 1978) and DEFLATE (rfc 1979)
compression.  ppp supports not only VJ-compression
but also Predictor-1 and DEFLATE compression. Normally, a
modem has built-in compression (e.g., v42.bis) and the
system may receive higher data rates from it as a result of
such compression. While this is generally a good thing in
most other situations, this higher speed data imposes a
penalty on the system by increasing the number of serial
interrupts the system has to process in talking to the modem
and also increases latency. Unlike VJ-compression,
Predictor-1 and DEFLATE compression pre-compresses
all network traffic flowing through the link, thus
reducing overheads to a minimum.

Supports
Microsoft’s IPCP extensions (rfc 1877).  Name
Server Addresses and NetBIOS Name Server Addresses can be
negotiated with clients using the Microsoft PPP stack
(i.e., Win95, WinNT)

Supports
Multi-link PPP (rfc 1990)  It is possible to
configure ppp to open more than one physical
connection to the peer, combining the bandwidth of all links
for better throughput.

Supports MPPE
(draft-ietf-pppext-mppe)  MPPE is Microsoft Point
to Point Encryption scheme. It is possible to configure
ppp to participate in Microsoft’s Windows VPN.
For now, ppp can only get encryption keys from CHAP
81 authentication. ppp must be compiled with DES for
MPPE to operate.

Supports
IPV6CP (rfc 2023).  An IPv6 connection can be made
in addition to or instead of the normal IPv4 connection.

PERMISSIONS

ppp is installed as user
root and group network, with permissions 04554. By default,
ppp will not run if the invoking user id is not zero.
This may be overridden by using the ’’allow
users’’ command in /etc/ppp/ppp.conf.
When running as a normal user, ppp switches to user
id 0 in order to alter the system routing table, set up
system lock files and read the ppp configuration files. All
external commands (executed via the "shell" or
"!bg" commands) are executed as the user id that
invoked ppp. Refer to the ’ID0’ logging
facility if you’re interested in what exactly is done
as user id zero.

GETTING STARTED

When you first run ppp
you may need to deal with some initial configuration
details.

•

Your kernel must include a
tunnel device (the GENERIC kernel includes one by default).
If it doesn’t, or if you require more than one tun
interface, you’ll need to rebuild your kernel with the
following line in your kernel configuration file:

pseudo-device
tun N

where N
is the maximum number of PPP connections you wish to
support.

•

Check your /dev
directory for the tunnel device entries /dev/tunN,
where ’N’ represents the number of the tun
device, starting at zero. If they don’t exist, you can
create them by running "sh ./MAKEDEV tunN". This
will create tun devices 0 through N.

•

Make sure that your system has
a group named ’’network’’ in the
/etc/group file and that the group contains the names
of all users expected to use ppp. Refer to the
group(5) manual page for details. Each of these users must
also be given access using the ’’allow
users’’ command in /etc/ppp/ppp.conf.

•

Create a log file. ppp
uses syslog(3) to log information. A common log file name is
/var/log/ppp.log. To make output go to this file, put
the following lines in the /etc/syslog.conf file:

!ppp 
*.*/var/log/ppp.log

It is possible
to have more than one PPP log file by creating a link
to the ppp executable:

# cd /usr/sbin

# ln ppp ppp0

and using

!ppp0 
*.*/var/log/ppp0.log

in
/etc/syslog.conf. Don’t forget to send a HUP
signal to syslogd(8) after altering
/etc/syslog.conf.

•

Although not strictly relevant
to ppp’s operation, you should configure your
resolver so that it works correctly. This can be done by
configuring a local DNS (using named(8)) or by adding the
correct ’nameserver’ lines to the file
/etc/resolv.conf. Refer to the resolv.conf(5) manual
page for details.

Alternatively,
if the peer supports it, ppp can be configured to ask
the peer for the nameserver address(es) and to update
/etc/resolv.conf automatically. Refer to the
’’enable dns’’ and
’’resolv’’ commands below for
details.

MANUAL DIALING

In the following examples, we
assume that your machine name is awfulhak. when you invoke
ppp (see PERMISSIONS above) with no arguments,
you are presented with a prompt:

ppp ON
awfulhak>

The
’ON’ part of your prompt should always be in
upper case. If it is in lower case, it means that you must
supply a password using the
’’passwd’’ command. This only ever
happens if you connect to a running version of ppp
and have not authenticated yourself using the correct
password.

You can start by
specifying the device name and speed:

ppp ON
awfulhak> set device /dev/cuaa0 
ppp ON awfulhak> set speed 38400

Normally,
hardware flow control (CTS/RTS) is used. However, under
certain circumstances (as may happen when you are connected
directly to certain PPP-capable terminal servers), this may
result in ppp hanging as soon as it tries to write
data to your communications link as it is waiting for the
CTS (clear to send) signal - which will never come. Thus, if
you have a direct line and can’t seem to make a
connection, try turning CTS/RTS off with ’’set
ctsrts off’’. If you need to do this, check the
’’set accmap’’ description below too
- you’ll probably need to ’’set accmap
000a0000’’.

Usually, parity
is set to ’’none’’, and this is
ppp’s default. Parity is a rather archaic error
checking mechanism that is no longer used because modern
modems do their own error checking, and most link-layer
protocols (that’s what ppp is) use much more
reliable checking mechanisms. Parity has a relatively huge
overhead (a 12.5% increase in traffic) and as a result, it
is always disabled (set to ’’none’’)
when PPP is opened. However, some ISPs (Internet Service
Providers) may use specific parity settings at connection
time (before PPP is opened). Notably, Compuserve insist on
even parity when logging in:

ppp ON
awfulhak> set parity even

You can now see
what your current device settings look like:

ppp ON
awfulhak> show physical 
Name: deflink 
State: closed 
Device: N/A 
Link Type: interactive 
Connect Count: 0 
Queued Packets: 0 
Phone Number: N/A

Defaults: 
Device List: /dev/cuaa0 
Characteristics: 38400bps, cs8, even parity, CTS/RTS on

Connect time: 0
secs 
0 octets in, 0 octets out 
Overall 0 bytes/sec 
ppp ON awfulhak>

The term command
can now be used to talk directly to the device:

ppp ON
awfulhak> term 
at 
OK 
atdt123456 
CONNECT 
login: myispusername 
Password: myisppassword 
Protocol: ppp

When the peer
starts to talk in PPP, ppp detects this
automatically and returns to command mode.

ppp ON
awfulhak> # No link has been established 
Ppp ON awfulhak> # We’ve connected & finished
LCP 
PPp ON awfulhak> # We’ve authenticated 
PPP ON awfulhak> # We’ve agreed IP numbers

If it does not,
it’s probable that the peer is waiting for your end to
start negotiating. To force ppp to start sending
PPP configuration packets to the peer, use the
’’~p’’ command to drop out of
terminal mode and enter packet mode.

If you never
even receive a login prompt, it is quite likely that the
peer wants to use PAP or CHAP authentication instead of
using Unix-style login/password authentication. To set
things up properly, drop back to the prompt and set your
authentication name and key, then reconnect:

~. 
ppp ON awfulhak> set authname myispusername 
ppp ON awfulhak> set authkey myisppassword 
ppp ON awfulhak> term 
at 
OK 
atdt123456 
CONNECT

You may need to
tell ppp to initiate negotiations with the peer here
too:

~p 
ppp ON awfulhak> # No link has been established 
Ppp ON awfulhak> # We’ve connected & finished
LCP 
PPp ON awfulhak> # We’ve authenticated 
PPP ON awfulhak> # We’ve agreed IP numbers

You are now
connected! Note that ’PPP’ in the prompt has
changed to capital letters to indicate that you have a peer
connection. If only some of the three Ps go uppercase, wait
until either everything is uppercase or lowercase. If they
revert to lowercase, it means that ppp couldn’t
successfully negotiate with the peer. A good first step for
troubleshooting at this point would be to

ppp ON
awfulhak> set log local phase lcp ipcp

and try again.
Refer to the ’’set log’’ command
description below for further details. If things fail at
this point, it is quite important that you turn logging on
and try again. It is also important that you note any prompt
changes and report them to anyone trying to help you.

When the link is
established, the show command can be used to see how things
are going:

PPP ON
awfulhak> show physical 
* Modem related information is shown here * 
PPP ON awfulhak> show ccp 
* CCP (compression) related information is shown here * 
PPP ON awfulhak> show lcp 
* LCP (line control) related information is shown here *

PPP ON awfulhak> show ipcp 
* IPCP (IP) related information is shown here * 
PPP ON awfulhak> show ipv6cp 
* IPV6CP (IPv6) related information is shown here * 
PPP ON awfulhak> show link 
* Link (high level) related information is shown here * 
PPP ON awfulhak> show bundle 
* Logical (high level) connection related information is
shown here *

At this point,
your machine has a host route to the peer. This means that
you can only make a connection with the host on the other
side of the link. If you want to add a default route entry
(telling your machine to send all packets without another
routing entry to the other side of the PPP link),
enter the following command:

PPP ON
awfulhak> add default HISADDR

The string
’HISADDR’ represents the IP address of the
connected peer. If the ’’add’’
command fails due to an existing route, you can overwrite
the existing route using:

PPP ON
awfulhak> add! default HISADDR

This command can
also be executed before actually making the connection. If a
new IP address is negotiated at connection time, ppp
will update your default route accordingly.

You can now use
your network applications (ping, telnet, ftp, etc.) in other
windows or terminals on your machine. If you wish to reuse
the current terminal, you can put ppp into the
background using your standard shell suspend and background
commands (usually ’’^Z’’ followed by
’’bg’’).

Refer to the
PPP COMMAND LIST section for details on all available
commands.

AUTOMATIC DIALING

To use automatic dialing, you
must prepare some Dial and Login chat scripts. See the
example definitions in
/usr/share/examples/ppp/ppp.conf.sample (the format
of /etc/ppp/ppp.conf is pretty simple). Each line
contains one comment, inclusion, label or command:

•

A line starting with a
(’’#’’) character is treated as a
comment line. Leading whitespace are ignored when
identifying comment lines.

•

An inclusion is a line
beginning with the word ’!include’. It must have
one argument - the file to include. You may wish to
’’!include ~/.ppp.conf’’ for
compatibility with older versions of ppp.

•

A label name starts in the
first column and is followed by a colon
(’’:’’).

•

A command line must contain a
space or tab in the first column.

The
/etc/ppp/ppp.conf file should consist of at least a
’’default’’ section. This section is
always executed. It should also contain one or more
sections, named according to their purpose, for example,
’’MyISP’’ would represent your ISP,
and ’’ppp-in’’ would represent an
incoming ppp configuration. You can now specify the
destination label name when you invoke ppp. Commands
associated with the ’’default’’
label are executed, followed by those associated with the
destination label provided. When ppp is started with
no arguments, the ’’default’’
section is still executed. The load command can be used to
manually load a section from the /etc/ppp/ppp.conf
file:

ppp ON
awfulhak> load MyISP

Note, no action
is taken by ppp after a section is loaded, whether
it’s the result of passing a label on the command line
or using the ’’load’’ command. Only
the commands specified for that label in the configuration
file are executed. However, when invoking ppp with
the −background, −ddial, or
−dedicated switches, the link mode tells
ppp to establish a connection. Refer to the
’’set mode’’ command below for
further details.

Once the
connection is made, the ’ppp’ portion of the
prompt will change to ’PPP’:

# ppp MyISP

... 
ppp ON awfulhak> dial 
Ppp ON awfulhak> 
PPp ON awfulhak> 
PPP ON awfulhak>

The Ppp prompt
indicates that ppp has entered the authentication
phase. The PPp prompt indicates that ppp has entered
the network phase. The PPP prompt indicates that ppp
has successfully negotiated a network layer protocol and is
in a usable state.

If the
/etc/ppp/ppp.linkup file is available, its contents
are executed when the PPP connection is established.
See the provided ’’pmdemand’’
example in /usr/share/examples/ppp/ppp.conf.sample
which runs a script in the background after the connection
is established (refer to the
’’shell’’ and
’’bg’’ commands below for a
description of possible substitution strings). Similarly,
when a connection is closed, the contents of the
/etc/ppp/ppp.linkdown file are executed. Both of
these files have the same format as
/etc/ppp/ppp.conf.

In previous
versions of ppp, it was necessary to re-add routes
such as the default route in the ppp.linkup file.
ppp supports ’sticky routes’, where all
routes that contain the HISADDR, MYADDR, HISADDR6 or MYADDR6
literals will automatically be updated when the values of
these variables change.

BACKGROUND DIALING

If you want to establish a
connection using ppp non-interactively (such as from
a crontab(5) entry or an at(1) job) you should use the
−background option. When
−background is specified, ppp attempts
to establish the connection immediately. If multiple phone
numbers are specified, each phone number will be tried once.
If the attempt fails, ppp exits immediately with a
non-zero exit code. If it succeeds, then ppp becomes
a daemon, and returns an exit status of zero to its caller.
The daemon exits automatically if the connection is dropped
by the remote system, or it receives a TERM signal.

DIAL ON DEMAND

Demand dialing is enabled with
the −auto or −ddial options. You
must also specify the destination label in
/etc/ppp/ppp.conf to use. It must contain the
’’set ifaddr’’ command to define the
remote peers IP address. (refer to
/usr/share/examples/ppp/ppp.conf.sample)

# ppp -auto
pmdemand

When
−auto or −ddial is specified,
ppp runs as a daemon but you can still configure or
examine its configuration by using the ’’set
server’’ command in /etc/ppp/ppp.conf,
(for example, ’’set server +3000
mypasswd’’) and connecting to the diagnostic
port as follows:

# pppctl 3000

(assuming tun0)

Password: 
PPP ON awfulhak> show who 
tcp (127.0.0.1:1028) *

The
’’show who’’ command lists users
that are currently connected to ppp itself. If the
diagnostic socket is closed or changed to a different
socket, all connections are immediately dropped.

In
−auto mode, when an outgoing packet is
detected, ppp will perform the dialing action (chat
script) and try to connect with the peer. In
−ddial mode, the dialing action is performed
any time the line is found to be down. If the connect fails,
the default behaviour is to wait 30 seconds and then attempt
to connect when another outgoing packet is detected. This
behaviour can be changed using the ’’set
redial’’ command:

set redial
secs

[ 
+inc[-max]][.next]
[attempts]

secs

is the number
of seconds to wait before attempting to connect again. If
the argument is the literal string ’random’, the
delay period is a random value between 1 and 30 seconds
inclusive.

inc

is the number
of seconds that secs should be incremented each time
a new dial attempt is made. The timeout reverts to
secs only after a successful connection is
established. The default value for inc is zero.

max

is the maximum
number of times ppp should increment secs. The
default value for max is 10.

next

is the number
of seconds to wait before attempting to dial the next number
in a list of numbers (see the ’’set
phone’’ command). The default is 3 seconds.
Again, if the argument is the literal string
’random’, the delay period is a random value
between 1 and 30 seconds.

attempts

is the maximum
number of times to try to connect for each outgoing packet
that triggers a dial. The previous value is unchanged if
this parameter is omitted. If a value of zero is specified
for attempts, ppp will keep trying until a
connection is made.

So, for
example:

set redial 10.3
4

will attempt to
connect 4 times for each outgoing packet that causes a dial
attempt with a 3 second delay between each number and a 10
second delay after all numbers have been tried. If multiple
phone numbers are specified, the total number of attempts is
still 4 (it does not attempt each number 4 times).

Alternatively,

set redial
10+10-5.3 20

tells ppp
to attempt to connect 20 times. After the first attempt,
ppp pauses for 10 seconds. After the next attempt it
pauses for 20 seconds and so on until after the sixth
attempt it pauses for 1 minute. The next 14 pauses will also
have a duration of one minute. If ppp connects,
disconnects and fails to connect again, the timeout starts
again at 10 seconds.

Modifying the
dial delay is very useful when running ppp in
−auto mode on both ends of the link. If each
end has the same timeout, both ends wind up calling each
other at the same time if the link drops and both ends have
packets queued. At some locations, the serial link may not
be reliable, and carrier may be lost at inappropriate times.
It is possible to have ppp redial should carrier be
unexpectedly lost during a session.

set reconnect
timeout ntries

This command
tells ppp to re-establish the connection
ntries times on loss of carrier with a pause of
timeout seconds before each try. For example,

set reconnect 3
5

tells ppp
that on an unexpected loss of carrier, it should wait
3 seconds before attempting to reconnect. This may
happen up to 5 times before ppp gives up. The
default value of ntries is zero (no reconnect). Care should
be taken with this option. If the local timeout is slightly
longer than the remote timeout, the reconnect feature will
always be triggered (up to the given number of times) after
the remote side times out and hangs up. NOTE: In this
context, losing too many LQRs constitutes a loss of carrier
and will trigger a reconnect. If the
−background flag is specified, all phone
numbers are dialed at most once until a connection is made.
The next number redial period specified with the
’’set redial’’ command is honoured,
as is the reconnect tries value. If your redial value is
less than the number of phone numbers specified, not all the
specified numbers will be tried. To terminate the program,
type

PPP ON
awfulhak> close 
ppp ON awfulhak> quit all

A simple
’’quit’’ command will terminate the
pppctl(8) or telnet(1) connection but not the ppp
program itself. You must use ’’quit
all’’ to terminate ppp as well.

RECEIVING INCOMING PPP
CONNECTIONS (Method 1)

To handle an incoming PPP
connection request, follow these steps:

1.

Make sure the modem and
(optionally) /etc/rc.serial is configured
correctly.

•

Use Hardware Handshake
(CTS/RTS) for flow control.

•

Modem should be set to NO echo
back (ATE0) and NO results string (ATQ1).

2.

Edit /etc/ttys to enable
a getty(8) on the port where the modem is attached. For
example:

ttyd1
"

/usr/libexec/getty std.38400 " dialup on secure

Don’t
forget to send a HUP signal to the init(8) process to start
the getty(8):

# kill -HUP
1

It is usually
also necessary to train your modem to the same DTR speed as
the getty:

# ppp 
ppp ON awfulhak> set device /dev/cuaa1 
ppp ON awfulhak> set speed 38400 
ppp ON awfulhak> term 
deflink: Entering terminal mode on /dev/cuaa1 
Type ’~?’ for help 
at 
OK 
at 
OK 
atz 
OK 
at 
OK 
~. 
ppp ON awfulhak> quit

3.

Create a
/usr/local/bin/ppplogin file with the following
contents:

#! /bin/sh 
exec /usr/sbin/ppp -direct incoming

Direct mode
(−direct) lets ppp work with stdin and
stdout. You can also use pppctl(8) to connect to a
configured diagnostic port, in the same manner as with
client-side ppp.

Here, the
incoming section must be set up in
/etc/ppp/ppp.conf.

Make sure that
the incoming section contains the ’’allow
users’’ command as appropriate.

4.

Prepare an account for the
incoming user.

ppp:xxxx:66:66:PPP
Login User:/home/ppp:/usr/local/bin/ppplogin

Refer to the
manual entries for adduser(8) and vipw(8) for details.

5.

Support for IPCP Domain Name
Server and NetBIOS Name Server negotiation can be enabled
using the ’’accept dns’’ and
’’set nbns’’ commands. Refer to
their descriptions below.

RECEIVING INCOMING PPP
CONNECTIONS (Method 2)

This method differs in that we
use ppp to authenticate the connection rather than
login(1):

1.

Configure your default section
in /etc/gettytab with automatic ppp recognition by
specifying the ’’pp’’
capability:

default:\

:pp=/usr/local/bin/ppplogin:\

.....

2.

Configure your serial
device(s), enable a getty(8) and create
/usr/local/bin/ppplogin as in the first three steps
for method 1 above.

3.

Add either ’’enable
chap’’ or ’’enable pap’’
(or both) to /etc/ppp/ppp.conf under the
’incoming’ label (or whatever label
ppplogin uses).

4.

Create an entry in
/etc/ppp/ppp.secret for each incoming user:

Pfredxxxx

Pgeorgeyyyy

Now, as soon as
getty(8) detects a ppp connection (by recognising the HDLC
frame headers), it runs
’’/usr/local/bin/ppplogin’’.

It is
VITAL that either PAP or CHAP are enabled as above.
If they are not, you are allowing anybody to establish a ppp
session with your machine without a password, opening
yourself up to all sorts of potential attacks.

AUTHENTICATING INCOMING
CONNECTIONS

Normally, the receiver of a
connection requires that the peer authenticates itself. This
may be done using login(1), but alternatively, you can use
PAP or CHAP. CHAP is the more secure of the two, but some
clients may not support it. Once you decide which you wish
to use, add the command ’enable chap’ or
’enable pap’ to the relevant section of
ppp.conf.

You must then
configure the /etc/ppp/ppp.secret file. This file
contains one line per possible client, each line containing
up to five fields:

name key
[

hisaddr [label [callback-number]]
]

The name
and key specify the client username and password. If
key is ’’*’’ and PAP is being
used, ppp will look up the password database
(passwd(5)) when authenticating. If the client does not
offer a suitable response based on any
name/key combination in ppp.secret,
authentication fails.

If
authentication is successful, hisaddr (if specified)
is used when negotiating IP numbers. See the
’’set ifaddr’’ command for
details.

If
authentication is successful and label is specified,
the current system label is changed to match the given
label. This will change the subsequent parsing of the
ppp.linkup and ppp.linkdown files.

If
authentication is successful and callback-number is
specified and ’’set callback’’ has
been used in ppp.conf, the client will be called back
on the given number. If CBCP is being used,
callback-number may also contain a list of numbers or
a ’’*’’, as if passed to the
’’set cbcp’’ command. The value will
be used in ppp’s subsequent CBCP phase.

PPP OVER TCP and UDP (a.k.a
Tunnelling)

Instead of running ppp
over a serial link, it is possible to use a TCP connection
instead by specifying the host, port and protocol as the
device:

set device
ui-gate:6669/tcp

Instead of
opening a serial device, ppp will open a TCP
connection to the given machine on the given socket. It
should be noted however that ppp doesn’t use
the telnet protocol and will be unable to negotiate with a
telnet server. You should set up a port for receiving this
PPP connection on the receiving machine (ui-gate).
This is done by first updating /etc/services to name
the service:

ppp-in 6669/tcp
# Incoming PPP connections over TCP

and updating
/etc/inetd.conf to tell inetd(8) how to deal with
incoming connections on that port:

ppp-in stream
tcp nowait root /usr/sbin/ppp ppp -direct ppp-in

Don’t
forget to send a HUP signal to inetd(8) after you’ve
updated /etc/inetd.conf. Here, we use a label named
’’ppp-in’’. The entry in
/etc/ppp/ppp.conf on ui-gate (the receiver) should
contain the following:

ppp-in: 
set timeout 0 
set ifaddr 10.0.4.1 10.0.4.2

and the entry in
/etc/ppp/ppp.linkup should contain:

ppp-in: 
add 10.0.1.0/24 HISADDR

It is necessary
to put the ’’add’’ command in
ppp.linkup to ensure that the route is only added
after ppp has negotiated and assigned addresses to
its interface.

You may also
want to enable PAP or CHAP for security. To enable PAP, add
the following line:

enable PAP

You’ll
also need to create the following entry in
/etc/ppp/ppp.secret:

MyAuthName
MyAuthPasswd

If
MyAuthPasswd is a ’’*’’, the
password is looked up in the passwd(5) database.

The entry in
/etc/ppp/ppp.conf on awfulhak (the initiator) should
contain the following:

ui-gate: 
set escape 0xff 
set device ui-gate:ppp-in/tcp 
set dial 
set timeout 30 
set log Phase Chat Connect hdlc LCP IPCP IPV6CP CCP tun 
set ifaddr 10.0.4.2 10.0.4.1

with the route
setup in /etc/ppp/ppp.linkup:

ui-gate: 
add 10.0.2.0/24 HISADDR

Again, if
you’re enabling PAP, you’ll also need this in
the /etc/ppp/ppp.conf profile:

set authname
MyAuthName 
set authkey MyAuthKey

We’re
assigning the address of 10.0.4.1 to ui-gate, and the
address 10.0.4.2 to awfulhak. To open the connection, just
type

awfulhak # ppp
-background ui-gate

The result will
be an additional "route" on awfulhak to the
10.0.2.0/24 network via the TCP connection, and an
additional "route" on ui-gate to the 10.0.1.0/24
network. The networks are effectively bridged - the
underlying TCP connection may be across a public network
(such as the Internet), and the PPP traffic is
conceptually encapsulated (although not packet by packet)
inside the TCP stream between the two gateways.

The major
disadvantage of this mechanism is that there are two
"guaranteed delivery" mechanisms in place - the
underlying TCP stream and whatever protocol is used over the
PPP link - probably TCP again. If packets are lost,
both levels will get in each others way trying to negotiate
sending of the missing packet.

To avoid this
overhead, it is also possible to do all this using UDP
instead of TCP as the transport by simply changing the
protocol from "tcp" to "udp". When using
UDP as a transport, ppp will operate in synchronous
mode. This is another gain as the incoming data does not
have to be rearranged into packets.

Care should be
taken when adding a default route through a tunneled setup
like this. It is quite common for the default route (added
in /etc/ppp/ppp.linkup) to end up routing the
link’s TCP connection through the tunnel, effectively
garrotting the connection. To avoid this, make sure you add
a static route for the benefit of the link:

ui-gate: 
set escape 0xff 
set device ui-gate:ppp-in/tcp 
add ui-gate x.x.x.x 
.....

where
’’x.x.x.x’’ is the IP number that
your route to ’’ui-gate’’ would
normally use.

When routing
your connection accross a public network such as the
Internet, it is preferable to encrypt the data. This can be
done with the help of the MPPE protocol, although currently
this means that you will not be able to also compress the
traffic as MPPE is implemented as a compression layer (thank
Microsoft for this). To enable MPPE encryption, add the
following lines to /etc/ppp/ppp.conf on the
server:

enable MSCHAPv2

disable deflate pred1 
deny deflate pred1

ensuring that
you’ve put the requisite entry in
/etc/ppp/ppp.secret (MSCHAPv2 is challenge based, so
passwd(5) cannot be used)

MSCHAPv2 and
MPPE are accepted by default, so the client end should work
without any additional changes (although ensure you have
’’set authname’’ and
’’set authkey’’ in your
profile).

NETWORK ADDRESS TRANSLATION
(PACKET ALIASING)

The −nat command
line option enables network address translation (a.k.a.
packet aliasing). This allows the ppp host to act as
a masquerading gateway for other computers over a local area
network. Outgoing IP packets are NAT’d so that they
appear to come from the ppp host, and incoming
packets are de-NAT’d so that they are routed to the
correct machine on the local area network. NAT allows
computers on private, unregistered subnets to have Internet
access, although they are invisible from the outside world.
In general, correct ppp operation should first be
verified with network address translation disabled. Then,
the −nat option should be switched on, and
network applications (web browser, telnet(1), ftp(1),
ping(8), traceroute(8)) should be checked on the ppp
host. Finally, the same or similar applications should be
checked on other computers in the LAN. If network
applications work correctly on the ppp host, but not
on other machines in the LAN, then the masquerading software
is working properly, but the host is either not forwarding
or possibly receiving IP packets. Check that IP forwarding
is enabled in /etc/rc.conf and that other machines
have designated the ppp host as the gateway for the
LAN.

PACKET FILTERING

This implementation supports
packet filtering. There are four kinds of filters: the
in filter, the out filter, the dial
filter and the alive filter. Here are the basics:

•

A filter definition has the
following syntax:

set filter
name rule-no action [!] [

[host] src_addr[/width]
[dst_addr[/width]] ] [proto [src cmp
port] [dst cmp port] [estab] [syn] [finrst]
[timeout secs]]

1.

Name should be one of
’in’, ’out’, ’dial’ or
’alive’.

2.

Rule-no is a numeric
value between ’0’ and ’39’
specifying the rule number. Rules are specified in numeric
order according to rule-no, but only if rule
’0’ is defined.

3.

Action may be specified
as ’permit’ or ’deny’, in which
case, if a given packet matches the rule, the associated
action is taken immediately. Action can also be
specified as ’clear’ to clear the action
associated with that particular rule, or as a new rule
number greater than the current rule. In this case, if a
given packet matches the current rule, the packet will next
be matched against the new rule number (rather than the next
rule number).

The
action may optionally be followed with an exclamation
mark (’’!’’), telling ppp to
reverse the sense of the following match.

4.

[src_addr[/width]]
and [dst_addr[/width]] are the source and
destination IP number specifications. If [/width] is
specified, it gives the number of relevant netmask bits,
allowing the specification of an address range.

Either
src_addr or dst_addr may be given the values
MYADDR, HISADDR, MYADDR6 or HISADDR6 (refer to the
description of the ’’bg’’ command
for a description of these values). When these values are
used, the filters will be updated any time the values
change. This is similar to the behaviour of the
’’add’’ command below.

5.

Proto may be any
protocol from protocols(5).

6.

Cmp is one of
’lt’, ’eq’ or ’gt’,
meaning less-than, equal and greater-than respectively.
Port can be specified as a numeric port or by service
name from /etc/services.

7.

The ’estab’,
’syn’, and ’finrst’ flags are only
allowed when proto is set to ’tcp’, and
represent the TH_ACK, TH_SYN and TH_FIN or TH_RST TCP flags
respectively.

8.

The timeout value adjusts the
current idle timeout to at least secs seconds. If a
timeout is given in the alive filter as well as in the
in/out filter, the in/out value is used. If no timeout is
given, the default timeout (set using set timeout and
defaulting to 180 seconds) is used.

•

Each filter can hold up to 40
rules, starting from rule 0. The entire rule set is not
effective until rule 0 is defined, i.e., the default is to
allow everything through.

•

If no rule in a defined set of
rules matches a packet, that packet will be discarded
(blocked). If there are no rules in a given filter, the
packet will be permitted.

•

It’s possible to filter
based on the payload of UDP frames where those frames
contain a PROTO_IP PPP frame header. See the
filter-decapsulation option below for further
details.

•

Use ’’set filter
name -1’’ to flush all rules.

See
/usr/share/examples/ppp/ppp.conf.sample.

SETTING THE IDLE
TIMER

To check/set the idle timer, use
the ’’show bundle’’ and
’’set timeout’’ commands:

ppp ON
awfulhak> set timeout 600

The timeout
period is measured in seconds, the default value for which
is 180 seconds (or 3 min). To disable the idle timer
function, use the command

ppp ON
awfulhak> set timeout 0

In
−ddial and −dedicated modes, the
idle timeout is ignored. In −auto mode, when
the idle timeout causes the PPP session to be closed,
the ppp program itself remains running. Another
trigger packet will cause it to attempt to re-establish the
link.

PREDICTOR-1 and DEFLATE
COMPRESSION

ppp supports both
Predictor type 1 and deflate compression. By default,
ppp will attempt to use (or be willing to accept)
both compression protocols when the peer agrees (or requests
them). The deflate protocol is preferred by ppp.
Refer to the ’’disable’’ and
’’deny’’ commands if you wish to
disable this functionality.

It is possible
to use a different compression algorithm in each direction
by using only one of ’’disable
deflate’’ and ’’deny
deflate’’ (assuming that the peer supports both
algorithms).

By default, when
negotiating DEFLATE, ppp will use a window size of
15. Refer to the ’’set deflate’’
command if you wish to change this behaviour.

A special
algorithm called DEFLATE24 is also available, and is
disabled and denied by default. This is exactly the same as
DEFLATE except that it uses CCP ID 24 to negotiate. This
allows ppp to successfully negotiate DEFLATE with
pppd version 2.3.*.

CONTROLLING IP
ADDRESS

For IPv4, ppp uses IPCP
to negotiate IP addresses. Each side of the connection
specifies the IP address that it’s willing to use, and
if the requested IP address is acceptable then ppp
returns an ACK to the requester. Otherwise, ppp
returns NAK to suggest that the peer use a different IP
address. When both sides of the connection agree to accept
the received request (and send an ACK), IPCP is set to the
open state and a network level connection is established. To
control this IPCP behaviour, this implementation has the
’’set ifaddr’’ command for defining
the local and remote IP address:

set ifaddr
[

src_addr[/nn] [ 
dst_addr[/nn] [ 
netmask [trigger_addr]]] ]

where,
’src_addr’ is the IP address that the local side
is willing to use, ’dst_addr’ is the IP address
which the remote side should use and ’netmask’
is the netmask that should be used. ’Src_addr’
defaults to the current hostname(1), ’dst_addr’
defaults to 0.0.0.0, and ’netmask’ defaults to
whatever mask is appropriate for ’src_addr’. It
is only possible to make ’netmask’ smaller than
the default. The usual value is 255.255.255.255, as most
kernels ignore the netmask of a POINTOPOINT interface.

Some incorrect
PPP implementations require that the peer negotiates
a specific IP address instead of ’src_addr’. If
this is the case, ’trigger_addr’ may be used to
specify this IP number. This will not affect the routing
table unless the other side agrees with this proposed
number.

set ifaddr
192.244.177.38 192.244.177.2 255.255.255.255 0.0.0.0

The above
specification means:

•

I will first suggest that my IP
address should be 0.0.0.0, but I will only accept an address
of 192.244.177.38.

•

I strongly insist that the peer
uses 192.244.177.2 as his own address and won’t permit
the use of any IP address but 192.244.177.2. When the peer
requests another IP address, I will always suggest that it
uses 192.244.177.2.

•

The routing table entry will
have a netmask of 0xffffffff.

This is all fine
when each side has a pre-determined IP address, however it
is often the case that one side is acting as a server which
controls all IP addresses and the other side should go along
with it. In order to allow more flexible behaviour, the
’’set ifaddr’’ command allows the
user to specify IP addresses more loosely:

set ifaddr
192.244.177.38/24 192.244.177.2/20

A number
followed by a slash (’’/’’)
represents the number of bits significant in the IP address.
The above example means:

•

I’d like to use
192.244.177.38 as my address if it is possible, but
I’ll also accept any IP address between 192.244.177.0
and 192.244.177.255.

•

I’d like to make him use
192.244.177.2 as his own address, but I’ll also permit
him to use any IP address between 192.244.176.0 and
192.244.191.255.

•

As you may have already
noticed, 192.244.177.2 is equivalent to saying
192.244.177.2/32.

•

As an exception, 0 is
equivalent to 0.0.0.0/0, meaning that I have no preferred IP
address and will obey the remote peers selection. When using
zero, no routing table entries will be made until a
connection is established.

•

192.244.177.2/0 means that
I’ll accept/permit any IP address but I’ll
suggest that 192.244.177.2 be used first.

When negotiating
IPv6 addresses, no control is given to the user. IPV6CP
negotiation is fully automatic.

CONNECTING WITH YOUR INTERNET
SERVICE PROVIDER

The following steps should be
taken when connecting to your ISP:

1.

Describe your providers phone
number(s) in the dial script using the ’’set
phone’’ command. This command allows you to set
multiple phone numbers for dialing and redialing separated
by either a pipe (’’|’’) or a colon
(’’:’’):

set phone
telno

[ 
|backupnumber]...[ 
:nextnumber]...

Numbers after
the first in a pipe-separated list are only used if the
previous number was used in a failed dial or login script.
Numbers separated by a colon are used sequentially,
irrespective of what happened as a result of using the
previous number. For example:

set phone
"1234567|2345678:3456789|4567890"

Here, the
1234567 number is attempted. If the dial or login script
fails, the 2345678 number is used next time, but *only* if
the dial or login script fails. On the dial after this, the
3456789 number is used. The 4567890 number is only used if
the dial or login script using the 3456789 fails. If the
login script of the 2345678 number fails, the next number is
still the 3456789 number. As many pipes and colons can be
used as are necessary (although a given site would usually
prefer to use either the pipe or the colon, but not both).
The next number redial timeout is used between all numbers.
When the end of the list is reached, the normal redial
period is used before starting at the beginning again. The
selected phone number is substituted for the \\T string in
the ’’set dial’’ command (see
below).

2.

Set up your redial requirements
using ’’set redial’’. For example,
if you have a bad telephone line or your provider is usually
engaged (not so common these days), you may want to specify
the following:

set redial 10
4

This says that
up to 4 phone calls should be attempted with a pause of 10
seconds before dialing the first number again.

3.

Describe your login procedure
using the ’’set dial’’ and
’’set login’’ commands. The
’’set dial’’ command is used to talk
to your modem and establish a link with your ISP, for
example:

set dial
"ABORT BUSY ABORT NO\\sCARRIER TIMEOUT 4 \"\"
\ 
ATZ OK-ATZ-OK ATDT\\T TIMEOUT 60 CONNECT"

This modem
"chat" string means:

•

Abort if the string
"BUSY" or "NO CARRIER" are received.

•

Set the timeout to 4
seconds.

•

Expect nothing.

•

Send ATZ.

•

Expect OK. If that’s not
received within the 4 second timeout, send ATZ and expect
OK.

•

Send ATDTxxxxxxx where xxxxxxx
is the next number in the phone list from above.

•

Set the timeout to 60.

•

Wait for the CONNECT
string.

Once the
connection is established, the login script is executed.
This script is written in the same style as the dial script,
but care should be taken to avoid having your password
logged:

set authkey
MySecret 
set login "TIMEOUT 15 login:-\\r-login: awfulhak \ 
word: \\P ocol: PPP HELLO"

This login
"chat" string means:

•

Set the timeout to 15
seconds.

•

Expect "login:". If
it’s not received, send a carriage return and expect
"login:" again.

•

Send "awfulhak"

•

Expect "word:" (the
tail end of a "Password:" prompt).

•

Send whatever our current
authkey value is set to.

•

Expect "ocol:" (the
tail end of a "Protocol:" prompt).

•

Send "PPP".

•

Expect "HELLO".

The
’’set authkey’’ command is logged
specially. When command or chat logging is
enabled, the actual password is not logged;
’********’ is logged instead.

Login scripts
vary greatly between ISPs. If you’re setting one up
for the first time, ENABLE CHAT LOGGING so that you
can see if your script is behaving as you expect.

4.

Use ’’set
device’’ and ’’set
speed’’ to specify your serial line and speed,
for example:

set device
/dev/cuaa0 
set speed 115200

Cuaa0 is the
first serial port on FreeBSD. If you’re running
ppp on OpenBSD, cua00 is the first. A speed of 115200
should be specified if you have a modem capable of bit rates
of 28800 or more. In general, the serial speed should be
about four times the modem speed.

5.

Use the ’’set
ifaddr’’ command to define the IP address.

•

If you know what IP address
your provider uses, then use it as the remote address
(dst_addr), otherwise choose something like 10.0.0.2/0 (see
below).

•

If your provider has assigned a
particular IP address to you, then use it as your address
(src_addr).

•

If your provider assigns your
address dynamically, choose a suitably unobtrusive and
unspecific IP number as your address. 10.0.0.1/0 would be
appropriate. The bit after the / specifies how many bits of
the address you consider to be important, so if you wanted
to insist on something in the class C network 1.2.3.0, you
could specify 1.2.3.1/24.

•

If you find that your ISP
accepts the first IP number that you suggest, specify third
and forth arguments of ’’0.0.0.0’’.
This will force your ISP to assign a number. (The third
argument will be ignored as it is less restrictive than the
default mask for your ’src_addr’).

An example for
a connection where you don’t know your IP number or
your ISPs IP number would be:

set ifaddr
10.0.0.1/0 10.0.0.2/0 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0

6.

In most cases, your ISP will
also be your default router. If this is the case, add the
line

add default
HISADDR

to
/etc/ppp/ppp.conf (or to /etc/ppp/ppp.linkup
for setups that don’t use −auto
mode).

This tells
ppp to add a default route to whatever the peer
address is (10.0.0.2 in this example). This route is
’sticky’, meaning that should the value of
HISADDR change, the route will be updated accordingly.

7.

If your provider requests that
you use PAP/CHAP authentication methods, add the next lines
to your /etc/ppp/ppp.conf file:

set authname
MyName 
set authkey MyPassword

Both are
accepted by default, so ppp will provide whatever
your ISP requires.

It should be
noted that a login script is rarely (if ever) required when
PAP or CHAP are in use.

8.

Ask your ISP to authenticate
your nameserver address(es) with the line

enable dns

Do NOT
do this if you are running a local DNS unless you also
either use ’’resolv readonly’’ or
have ’’resolv restore’’ in
/etc/ppp/ppp.linkdown, as ppp will simply
circumvent its use by entering some nameserver lines in
/etc/resolv.conf.

Please refer to
/usr/share/examples/ppp/ppp.conf.sample and
/usr/share/examples/ppp/ppp.linkup.sample for some
real examples. The pmdemand label should be appropriate for
most ISPs.

LOGGING FACILITY

ppp is able to generate
the following log info either via syslog(3) or directly to
the screen:

All

Enable all
logging facilities. This generates a lot of log. The most
common use of ’all’ is as a basis, where you
remove some facilities after enabling ’all’
(’debug’ and ’timer’ are usually
best disabled.)

Async

Dump async
level packet in hex.

CBCP

Generate CBCP
(CallBack Control Protocol) logs.

CCP

Generate a CCP
packet trace.

Chat

Generate
’dial’, ’login’,
’logout’ and ’hangup’ chat script
trace logs.

Command

Log commands
executed either from the command line or any of the
configuration files.

Connect

Log Chat lines
containing the string "CONNECT".

Debug

Log debug
information.

DNS

Log DNS QUERY
packets.

Filter

Log packets
permitted by the dial filter and denied by any filter.

HDLC

Dump HDLC
packet in hex.

ID0

Log all
function calls specifically made as user id 0.

IPCP

Generate an
IPCP packet trace.

LCP

Generate an LCP
packet trace.

LQM

Generate LQR
reports.

Phase

Phase
transition log output.

Physical

Dump physical
level packet in hex.

Radius

Dump RADIUS
information. RADIUS information resulting from the link
coming up or down is logged at
’’Phase’’ level unless
’’Radius’’ logging is enabled. This
log level is most useful for monitoring RADIUS alive
information.

Sync

Dump sync level
packet in hex.

TCP/IP

Dump all TCP/IP
packets.

Timer

Log timer
manipulation.

TUN

Include the tun
device on each log line.

Warning

Output to the
terminal device. If there is currently no terminal, output
is sent to the log file using syslogs LOG_WARNING.

Error

Output to both
the terminal device and the log file using syslogs
LOG_ERROR.

Alert

Output to the
log file using LOG_ALERT.

The
’’set log’’ command allows you to
set the logging output level. Multiple levels can be
specified on a single command line. The default is
equivalent to ’’set log Phase’’.

It is also
possible to log directly to the screen. The syntax is the
same except that the word ’’local’’
should immediately follow ’’set
log’’. The default is ’’set log
local’’ (i.e., only the un-maskable warning,
error and alert output).

If The first
argument to ’’set log [local]’’
begins with a ’+’ or a ’-’
character, the current log levels are not cleared, for
example:

PPP ON
awfulhak> set log phase 
PPP ON awfulhak> show log 
Log: Phase Warning Error Alert 
Local: Warning Error Alert 
PPP ON awfulhak> set log +tcp/ip -warning 
PPP ON awfulhak> set log local +command 
PPP ON awfulhak> show log 
Log: Phase TCP/IP Warning Error Alert 
Local: Command Warning Error Alert

Log messages of
level Warning, Error and Alert are not controllable using
’’set log [local]’’.

The
Warning level is special in that it will not be
logged if it can be displayed locally.

SIGNAL HANDLING

ppp deals with the
following signals:

INT

Receipt of this
signal causes the termination of the current connection (if
any). This will cause ppp to exit unless it is in
−auto or −ddial mode.

HUP, TERM & QUIT

These signals tell ppp
to exit.

USR1

This signal,
tells ppp to re-open any existing server socket,
dropping all existing diagnostic connections. Sockets that
couldn’t previously be opened will be retried.

USR2

This signal,
tells ppp to close any existing server socket,
dropping all existing diagnostic connections. SIGUSR1 can
still be used to re-open the socket.

MULTI-LINK PPP

If you wish to use more than one
physical link to connect to a PPP peer, that peer
must also understand the MULTI-LINK PPP protocol.
Refer to RFC 1990 for specification details.

The peer is
identified using a combination of his ’’endpoint
discriminator’’ and his
’’authentication id’’. Either or
both of these may be specified. It is recommended that at
least one is specified, otherwise there is no way of
ensuring that all links are actually connected to the same
peer program, and some confusing lock-ups may result.
Locally, these identification variables are specified using
the ’’set enddisc’’ and
’’set authname’’ commands. The
’authname’ (and ’authkey’) must be
agreed in advance with the peer.

Multi-link
capabilities are enabled using the ’’set
mrru’’ command (set maximum reconstructed
receive unit). Once multi-link is enabled, ppp will
attempt to negotiate a multi-link connection with the
peer.

By default, only
one ’link’ is available (called
’deflink’). To create more links, the
’’clone’’ command is used. This
command will clone existing links, where all characteristics
are the same except:

1.

The new link has its own name
as specified on the ’’clone’’
command line.

2.

The new link is an
’interactive’ link. Its mode may subsequently be
changed using the ’’set mode’’
command.

3.

The new link is in a
’closed’ state.

A summary of all
available links can be seen using the ’’show
links’’ command.

Once a new link
has been created, command usage varies. All link specific
commands must be prefixed with the ’’link
name’’ command, specifying on which link
the command is to be applied. When only a single link is
available, ppp is smart enough not to require the
’’link name’’ prefix.

Some commands
can still be used without specifying a link - resulting in
an operation at the ’bundle’ level. For example,
once two or more links are available, the command
’’show ccp’’ will show CCP
configuration and statistics at the multi-link level, and
’’link deflink show ccp’’ will show
the same information at the
’’deflink’’ link level.

Armed with this
information, the following configuration might be used:

mp: 
set timeout 0 
set log phase chat 
set device /dev/cuaa0 /dev/cuaa1 /dev/cuaa2 
set phone "123456789" 
set dial "ABORT BUSY ABORT NO\sCARRIER TIMEOUT 5
\"\" ATZ \ 
OK-AT-OK \\dATDT\\T TIMEOUT 45 CONNECT" 
set login 
set ifaddr 10.0.0.1/0 10.0.0.2/0 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 
set authname ppp 
set authkey ppppassword

set mrru
1500

clone 1,2,3

# Create 3 new links - duplicates of the default 
link deflink remove

# Delete the default link (called
’’deflink’’) 

Note how all
cloning is done at the end of the configuration. Usually,
the link will be configured first, then cloned. If you wish
all links to be up all the time, you can add the following
line to the end of your configuration.

link 1,2,3 set
mode ddial

If you want the
links to dial on demand, this command could be used:

link * set mode
auto

Links may be
tied to specific names by removing the ’’set
device’’ line above, and specifying the
following after the ’’clone’’
command:

link 1 set
device /dev/cuaa0 
link 2 set device /dev/cuaa1 
link 3 set device /dev/cuaa2

Use the
’’help’’ command to see which
commands require context (using the
’’link’’ command), which have
optional context and which should not have any context.

When ppp
has negotiated MULTI-LINK mode with the peer, it
creates a local domain socket in the /var/run
directory. This socket is used to pass link information
(including the actual link file descriptor) between
different ppp invocations. This facilitates
ppp’s ability to be run from a getty(8) or
directly from /etc/gettydefs (using the
’pp=’ capability), without needing to have
initial control of the serial line. Once ppp
negotiates multi-link mode, it will pass its open link to
any already running process. If there is no already running
process, ppp will act as the master, creating the
socket and listening for new connections.

PPP COMMAND LIST

This section lists the available
commands and their effect. They are usable either from an
interactive ppp session, from a configuration file or
from a pppctl(8) or telnet(1) session.

accept|deny|enable|disable
option....

These directives tell
ppp how to negotiate the initial connection with the
peer. Each ’’option’’ has a default
of either accept or deny and enable or disable.
’’Accept’’ means that the option
will be ACK’d if the peer asks for it.
’’Deny’’ means that the option will
be NAK’d if the peer asks for it.
’’Enable’’ means that the option
will be requested by us. ’’Disable’’
means that the option will not be requested by us.

’’Option’’
may be one of the following:

acfcomp

Default: Enabled and Accepted.
ACFComp stands for Address and Control Field Compression.
Non LCP packets will usually have an address field of 0xff
(the All-Stations address) and a control field of 0x03 (the
Unnumbered Information command). If this option is
negotiated, these two bytes are simply not sent, thus
minimising traffic.

See
rfc1662 for details.

chap[05]

Default: Disabled and Accepted.
CHAP stands for Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol.
Only one of CHAP and PAP (below) may be negotiated. With
CHAP, the authenticator sends a "challenge"
message to its peer. The peer uses a one-way hash function
to encrypt the challenge and sends the result back. The
authenticator does the same, and compares the results. The
advantage of this mechanism is that no passwords are sent
across the connection. A challenge is made when the
connection is first made. Subsequent challenges may occur.
If you want to have your peer authenticate itself, you must
’’enable chap’’. in
/etc/ppp/ppp.conf, and have an entry in
/etc/ppp/ppp.secret for the peer.

When using CHAP
as the client, you need only specify
’’AuthName’’ and
’’AuthKey’’ in
/etc/ppp/ppp.conf. CHAP is accepted by default. Some
PPP implementations use "MS-CHAP" rather
than MD5 when encrypting the challenge. MS-CHAP is a
combination of MD4 and DES. If ppp was built on a
machine with DES libraries available, it will respond to
MS-CHAP authentication requests, but will never request
them.

deflate

Default: Enabled and Accepted.
This option decides if deflate compression will be used by
the Compression Control Protocol (CCP). This is the same
algorithm as used by the gzip(1) program. Note: There is a
problem negotiating deflate capabilities with pppd(8)
- a PPP implementation available under many operating
systems. pppd (version 2.3.1) incorrectly attempts to
negotiate deflate compression using type 24 as
the CCP configuration type rather than type 26 as
specified in rfc1979. Type 24 is actually
specified as ’’PPP Magna-link Variable Resource
Compression’’ in rfc1975! ppp is
capable of negotiating with pppd, but only if
’’deflate24’’ is enabled and
accepted.

deflate24

Default: Disabled and Denied.
This is a variance of the deflate option, allowing
negotiation with the pppd(8) program. Refer to the
deflate section above for details. It is disabled by
default as it violates rfc1975.

dns

Default: Disabled and Denied.
This option allows DNS negotiation.

If
’’enabled,’’ ppp will request
that the peer confirms the entries in
/etc/resolv.conf. If the peer NAKs our request
(suggesting new IP numbers), /etc/resolv.conf is
updated and another request is sent to confirm the new
entries.

If
’’accepted,’’ ppp will answer
any DNS queries requested by the peer rather than rejecting
them. The answer is taken from /etc/resolv.conf
unless the ’’set dns’’ command is
used as an override.

enddisc

Default: Enabled and Accepted.
This option allows control over whether we negotiate an
endpoint discriminator. We only send our discriminator if
’’set enddisc’’ is used and
enddisc is enabled. We reject the peers discriminator
if enddisc is denied.

LANMan|chap80lm

Default: Disabled and Accepted.
The use of this authentication protocol is discouraged as it
partially violates the authentication protocol by
implementing two different mechanisms (LANMan & NT)
under the guise of a single CHAP type (0x80).
’’LANMan’’ uses a simple DES
encryption mechanism and is the least secure of the CHAP
alternatives (although is still more secure than PAP).

Refer to the
’’MSChap’’ description below for
more details.

lqr

Default: Disabled and Accepted.
This option decides if Link Quality Requests will be sent or
accepted. LQR is a protocol that allows ppp to
determine that the link is down without relying on the
modems carrier detect. When LQR is enabled, ppp sends
the QUALPROTO option (see ’’set
lqrperiod’’ below) as part of the LCP request.
If the peer agrees, both sides will exchange LQR packets at
the agreed frequency, allowing detailed link quality
monitoring by enabling LQM logging. If the peer
doesn’t agree, ppp will send ECHO LQR requests
instead. These packets pass no information of interest, but
they MUST be replied to by the peer.

Whether using
LQR or ECHO LQR, ppp will abruptly drop the
connection if 5 unacknowledged packets have been sent rather
than sending a 6th. A message is logged at the PHASE
level, and any appropriate
’’reconnect’’ values are honoured as
if the peer were responsible for dropping the
connection.

mppe

Default: Enabled and Accepted.
This is Microsoft Point to Point Encryption scheme. MPPE key
size can be 40-, 56- and 128-bits. Refer to
’’set mppe’’ command.

MSChapV2|chap81

Default: Disabled and Accepted.
It is very similar to standard CHAP (type 0x05) except that
it issues challenges of a fixed 16 bytes in length and uses
a combination of MD4, SHA-1 and DES to encrypt the challenge
rather than using the standard MD5 mechanism.

MSChap|chap80nt

Default: Disabled and Accepted.
The use of this authentication protocol is discouraged as it
partially violates the authentication protocol by
implementing two different mechanisms (LANMan & NT)
under the guise of a single CHAP type (0x80). It is very
similar to standard CHAP (type 0x05) except that it issues
challenges of a fixed 8 bytes in length and uses a
combination of MD4 and DES to encrypt the challenge rather
than using the standard MD5 mechanism. CHAP type 0x80 for
LANMan is also supported - see ’’enable
LANMan’’ for details.

Because both
’’LANMan’’ and
’’NT’’ use CHAP type 0x80, when
acting as authenticator with both
’’enabled’’, ppp will
rechallenge the peer up to three times if it responds using
the wrong one of the two protocols. This gives the peer a
chance to attempt using both protocols.

Conversely,
when ppp acts as the authenticatee with both
protocols ’’accepted’’, the
protocols are used alternately in response to
challenges.

Note: If only
LANMan is enabled, pppd(8) (version 2.3.5) misbehaves when
acting as authenticatee. It provides both the NT and the
LANMan answers, but also suggests that only the NT answer
should be used.

pap

Default: Disabled and Accepted.
PAP stands for Password Authentication Protocol. Only one of
PAP and CHAP (above) may be negotiated. With PAP, the ID and
Password are sent repeatedly to the peer until
authentication is acknowledged or the connection is
terminated. This is a rather poor security mechanism. It is
only performed when the connection is first established. If
you want to have your peer authenticate itself, you must
’’enable pap’’. in
/etc/ppp/ppp.conf, and have an entry in
/etc/ppp/ppp.secret for the peer (although see the
’’passwdauth’’ and ’’set
radius’’ options below).

When using PAP
as the client, you need only specify
’’AuthName’’ and
’’AuthKey’’ in
/etc/ppp/ppp.conf. PAP is accepted by default.

pred1

Default: Enabled and Accepted.
This option decides if Predictor 1 compression will be used
by the Compression Control Protocol (CCP).

protocomp

Default: Enabled and Accepted.
This option is used to negotiate PFC (Protocol Field
Compression), a mechanism where the protocol field number is
reduced to one octet rather than two.

shortseq

Default: Enabled and Accepted.
This option determines if ppp will request and accept
requests for short (12 bit) sequence numbers when
negotiating multi-link mode. This is only applicable if our
MRRU is set (thus enabling multi-link).

vjcomp

Default: Enabled and Accepted.
This option determines if Van Jacobson header compression
will be used.

The following
options are not actually negotiated with the peer.
Therefore, accepting or denying them makes no sense.

filter-decapsulation

Default: Disabled. When this
option is enabled, ppp will examine UDP frames to see
if they actually contain a PPP frame as their
payload. If this is the case, all filters will operate on
the payload rather than the actual packet.

This is useful
if you want to send PPPoUDP traffic over a PPP link,
but want that link to do smart things with the real data
rather than the UDP wrapper.

The UDP frame
payload must not be compressed in any way, otherwise
ppp will not be able to interpret it. It’s
therefore recommended that you disable vj pred1
deflate and deny vj pred1 deflate in the
configuration for the ppp invocation with the udp
link.

force-scripts

Default: Disabled. Forces
execution of the configured chat scripts in direct and
dedicated modes.

idcheck

Default: Enabled. When
ppp exchanges low-level LCP, CCP and IPCP
configuration traffic, the Identifier field of any
replies is expected to be the same as that of the request.
By default, ppp drops any reply packets that do not
contain the expected identifier field, reporting the fact at
the respective log level. If idcheck is disabled,
ppp will ignore the identifier field.

iface-alias

Default: Enabled if
−nat is specified. This option simply tells
ppp to add new interface addresses to the interface
rather than replacing them. The option can only be enabled
if network address translation is enabled (’’nat
enable yes’’).

With this
option enabled, ppp will pass traffic for old
interface addresses through the NAT engine (see
libalias(3)), resulting in the ability (in
−auto mode) to properly connect the process
that caused the PPP link to come up in the first place.

Disabling NAT
with ’’nat enable no’’ will also
disable ’iface-alias’.

ipcp

Default: Enabled. This option
allows ppp to attempt to negotiate IP control
protocol capabilities and if successful to exchange IP
datagrams with the peer.

ipv6cp

Default: Enabled. This option
allows ppp to attempt to negotiate IPv6 control
protocol capabilities and if successful to exchange IPv6
datagrams with the peer.

keep-session

Default: Disabled. When
ppp runs as a Multi-link server, a different
ppp instance initially receives each connection.
After determining that the link belongs to an already
existing bundle (controlled by another ppp
invocation), ppp will transfer the link to that
process.

If the link is
a tty device or if this option is enabled, ppp will
not exit, but will change its process name to
’’session owner’’ and wait for the
controlling ppp to finish with the link and deliver a
signal back to the idle process. This prevents the confusion
that results from ppp’s parent considering the
link resource available again.

For tty devices
that have entries in /etc/ttys, this is necessary to
prevent another getty(8) from being started, and for program
links such as sshd(8), it prevents sshd(8) from exiting due
to the death of its child. As ppp cannot determine
its parents requirements (except for the tty case), this
option must be enabled manually depending on the
circumstances.

loopback

Default: Enabled. When
loopback is enabled, ppp will automatically
loop back packets being sent out with a destination address
equal to that of the PPP interface. If disabled,
ppp will send the packet, probably resulting in an
ICMP redirect from the other end. It is convenient to have
this option enabled when the interface is also the default
route as it avoids the necessity of a loopback route.

passwdauth

Default: Disabled. Enabling
this option will tell the PAP authentication code to use the
password database (see passwd(5)) to authenticate the caller
if they cannot be found in the /etc/ppp/ppp.secret
file. /etc/ppp/ppp.secret is always checked first. If
you wish to use passwords from passwd(5), but also to
specify an IP number or label for a given client, use
’’*’’ as the client password in
/etc/ppp/ppp.secret.

proxy

Default: Disabled. Enabling
this option will tell ppp to proxy ARP for the peer.
This means that ppp will make an entry in the ARP
table using HISADDR and the MAC address of the local network
in which HISADDR appears. This allows other machines
connecteed to the LAN to talk to the peer as if the peer
itself was connected to the LAN. The proxy entry cannot be
made unless HISADDR is an address from a LAN.

proxyall

Default: Disabled. Enabling
this will tell ppp to add proxy arp entries for every
IP address in all class C or smaller subnets routed via the
tun interface.

Proxy arp
entries are only made for sticky routes that are added using
the ’’add’’ command. No proxy arp
entries are made for the interface address itself (as
created by the ’’set ifaddr’’
command).

sroutes

Default: Enabled. When the
’’add’’ command is used with the
HISADDR, MYADDR, HISADDR6 or MYADDR6 values, entries are
stored in the ’sticky route’ list. Each time
these variables change, this list is re-applied to the
routing table.

Disabling this
option will prevent the re-application of sticky routes,
although the ’stick route’ list will still be
maintained.

[tcp] 
mssfixup

Default: Enabled. This option
tells ppp to adjust TCP SYN packets so that the
maximum receive segment size is not greater than the amount
allowed by the interface MTU.

throughput

Default: Enabled. This option
tells ppp to gather throughput statistics. Input and
output is sampled over a rolling 5 second window, and
current, best and total figures are retained. This data is
output when the relevant PPP layer shuts down, and is
also available using the ’’show’’
command. Throughput statistics are available at the
’’IPCP’’ and
’’physical’’ levels.

utmp

Default: Enabled. Normally,
when a user is authenticated using PAP or CHAP, and when
ppp is running in −direct mode, an entry
is made in the utmp and wtmp files for that user. Disabling
this option will tell ppp not to make any utmp or
wtmp entries. This is usually only necessary if you require
the user to both login and authenticate themselves.

add 
[!] dest[/nn] [mask]
[gateway]

Dest is the destination
IP address. The netmask is specified either as a number of
bits with /nn or as an IP number using mask.
0 0 or simply 0 with no mask refers to the
default route. It is also possible to use the literal name
’default’ instead of 0. Gateway is
the next hop gateway to get to the given dest
machine/network. Refer to the route(8) command for further
details.

It is possible
to use the symbolic names ’MYADDR’,
’HISADDR’, ’MYADDR6’ or
’HISADDR6’ as the destination, and
’HISADDR’ or ’HISADDR6’ as the
gateway. ’MYADDR’ is replaced with the
interface IP address, ’HISADDR’ is replaced with
the interface IP destination (peer) address,
’MYADDR6’ is replaced with the interface IPv6
address, and ’HISADDR6’ is replaced with the
interface IPv6 destination address,

If the
add! command is used (note the trailing
’’!’’), then if the route already
exists, it will be updated as with the ’route
change’ command (see route(8) for further
details).

Routes that
contain the ’’HISADDR’’,
’’MYADDR’’,
’’HISADDR6’’,
’’MYADDR6’’,
’’DNS0’’, or
’’DNS1’’ constants are considered
’sticky’. They are stored in a list (use
’’show ncp’’ to see the list), and
each time the value of one of these variables changes, the
appropriate routing table entries are updated. This facility
may be disabled using ’’disable
sroutes’’.

allow command
[args]

This command controls access to
ppp and its configuration files. It is possible to
allow user-level access, depending on the configuration file
label and on the mode that ppp is being run in. For
example, you may wish to configure ppp so that only
user ’fred’ may access label
’fredlabel’ in −background
mode.

User id 0 is
immune to these commands.

allow user 
[s] logname...

By default, only user id 0 is
allowed access to ppp. If this command is used, all
of the listed users are allowed access to the section in
which the ’’allow users’’ command is
found. The ’default’ section is always checked
first (even though it is only ever automatically loaded at
startup). ’’allow users’’ commands
are cumulative in a given section, but users allowed in any
given section override users allowed in the default section,
so it’s possible to allow users access to everything
except a given label by specifying default users in the
’default’ section, and then specifying a new
user list for that label.

If user
’*’ is specified, access is allowed to all
users.

allow mode 
[s] mode...

By default, access using any
ppp mode is possible. If this command is used, it
restricts the access modes allowed to load the label
under which this command is specified. Again, as with the
’’allow users’’ command, each
’’allow modes’’ command overrides
any previous settings, and the ’default’ section
is always checked first.

Possible modes
are: ’interactive’, ’auto’,
’direct’, ’dedicated’,
’ddial’, ’background’ and
’*’.

When running in
multi-link mode, a section can be loaded if it allows
any of the currently existing line modes.

nat command
[args]

This command allows the control
of the network address translation (also known as
masquerading or IP aliasing) facilities that are built into
ppp. NAT is done on the external interface only, and
is unlikely to make sense if used with the
−direct flag.

If nat is
enabled on your system (it may be omitted at compile time),
the following commands are possible:

nat enable yes|no

This command either switches
network address translation on or turns it off. The
−nat command line flag is synonymous with
’’nat enable yes’’.

nat addr [addr_local
addr_alias]

This command allows data for
addr_alias to be redirected to addr_local. It
is useful if you own a small number of real IP numbers that
you wish to map to specific machines behind your
gateway.

nat deny_incoming yes|no

If set to yes, this command
will refuse all incoming packets where an aliasing link
doesn’t already exist. Refer to the CONCEPTUAL
BACKGROUND section of libalias(3) for a description of
what an ’’aliasing link’’ is.

It should be
noted under what circumstances an aliasing link is created
by libalias(3). It may be necessary to further protect your
network from outside connections using the ’’set
filter’’ or ’’nat
target’’ commands.

nat help|?

This command gives a summary of
available nat commands.

nat log yes|no

This option causes various NAT
statistics and information to be logged to the file
/var/log/alias.log.

nat port proto targetIP

:targetPort[ 
-targetPort] aliasPort[ 
-aliasPort] [ 
remoteIP:remotePort[ 
-remotePort]]

This command causes incoming
proto connections to aliasPort to be
redirected to targetPort on targetIP.
proto is either ’’tcp’’ or
’’udp’’.

A range of port
numbers may be specified as shown above. The ranges must be
of the same size.

If
remoteIP is specified, only data coming from that IP
number is redirected. remotePort must either be
’’0’’ (indicating any source port)
or a range of ports the same size as the other ranges.

This option is
useful if you wish to run things like Internet phone on
machines behind your gateway, but is limited in that
connections to only one interior machine per source machine
and target port are possible.

nat proto proto localIP [

publicIP [remoteIP]]

This command tells ppp
to redirect packets of protocol type proto (see
protocols(5)) to the internal address localIP.

If
publicIP is specified, only packets destined for that
address are matched, otherwise the default alias address is
used.

If
remoteIP is specified, only packets matching that
source address are matched,

This command is
useful for redirecting tunnel endpoints to an internal
machine, for example:

nat proto
ipencap 10.0.0.1

nat proxy cmd arg...

This command tells ppp
to proxy certain connections, redirecting them to a given
server. Refer to the description of
PacketAliasProxyRule() in libalias(3) for details of
the available commands.

nat punch_fw [base
count]

This command tells ppp
to punch holes in the firewall for FTP or IRC DCC
connections. This is done dynamically by installing
termporary firewall rules which allow a particular
connection (and only that connection) to go through the
firewall. The rules are removed once the corresponding
connection terminates.

A maximum of
count rules starting from rule number base
will be used for punching firewall holes. The range will be
cleared when the ’’nat punch_fw’’
command is run.

If no arguments
are given, firewall punching is disabled.

nat skinny_port
[port]

This command tells ppp
which TCP port is used by the Skinny Station protocol.
Skinny is used by Cisco IP phones to communicate with Cisco
Call Managers to setup voice over IP calls. The typical port
used by Skinny is 2000.

If no argument
is given, skinny aliasing is disabled.

nat same_ports yes|no

When enabled, this command will
tell the network address translation engine to attempt to
avoid changing the port number on outgoing packets. This is
useful if you want to support protocols such as RPC and LPD
which require connections to come from a well known
port.

nat target [address]

Set the given target address or
clear it if no address is given. The target address is used
by libalias to specify how to NAT incoming packets by
default. If a target address is not set or if
’’default’’ is given, packets are
not altered and are allowed to route to the internal
network.

The target
address may be set to ’’MYADDR’’, in
which case libalias will redirect all packets to the
interface address.

nat use_sockets yes|no

When enabled, this option tells
the network address translation engine to create a socket so
that it can guarantee a correct incoming ftp data or IRC
connection.

nat unregistered_only yes|no

Only alter outgoing packets
with an unregistered source address. According to RFC 1918,
unregistered source addresses are 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12
and 192.168.0.0/16.

These commands
are also discussed in the file README.nat which comes
with the source distribution.

[!] 
bg command

The given command is
executed in the background with the following words
replaced:

AUTHNAME

This is
replaced with the local authname value. See the
’’set authname’’ command below.

COMPILATIONDATE

This is
replaced with the date on which ppp was compiled.

DNS0 & DNS1

These are
replaced with the primary and secondary nameserver IP
numbers. If nameservers are negotiated by IPCP, the values
of these macros will change.

ENDDISC

This is
replaced with the local endpoint discriminator value. See
the ’’set enddisc’’ command
below.

HISADDR

This is
replaced with the peers IP number.

HISADDR6

This is
replaced with the peers IPv6 number.

INTERFACE

This is
replaced with the name of the interface that’s in
use.

IPOCTETSIN

This is
replaced with the number of IP bytes received since the
connection was established.

IPOCTETSOUT

This is
replaced with the number of IP bytes sent since the
connection was established.

IPPACKETSIN

This is
replaced with the number of IP packets received since the
connection was established.

IPPACKETSOUT

This is
replaced with the number of IP packets sent since the
connection was established.

IPV6OCTETSIN

This is
replaced with the number of IPv6 bytes received since the
connection was established.

IPV6OCTETSOUT

This is
replaced with the number of IPv6 bytes sent since the
connection was established.

IPV6PACKETSIN

This is
replaced with the number of IPv6 packets received since the
connection was established.

IPV6PACKETSOUT

This is
replaced with the number of IPv6 packets sent since the
connection was established.

LABEL

This is
replaced with the last label name used. A label may be
specified on the ppp command line, via the
’’load’’ or
’’dial’’ commands and in the
ppp.secret file.

MYADDR

This is
replaced with the IP number assigned to the local
interface.

MYADDR6

This is
replaced with the IPv6 number assigned to the local
interface.

OCTETSIN

This is
replaced with the number of bytes received since the
connection was established.

OCTETSOUT

This is
replaced with the number of bytes sent since the connection
was established.

PACKETSIN

This is
replaced with the number of packets received since the
connection was established.

PACKETSOUT

This is
replaced with the number of packets sent since the
connection was established.

PEER_ENDDISC

This is
replaced with the value of the peers endpoint
discriminator.

PROCESSID

This is
replaced with the current process id.

SOCKNAME

This is
replaced with the name of the diagnostic socket.

UPTIME

This is
replaced with the bundle uptime in HH:MM:SS format.

USER

This is
replaced with the username that has been authenticated with
PAP or CHAP. Normally, this variable is assigned only in
-direct mode. This value is available irrespective of
whether utmp logging is enabled.

VERSION

This is
replaced with the current version number of ppp.

These
substitutions are also done by the ’’set
proctitle’’, ’’ident’’
and ’’log’’ commands.

If you wish to
pause ppp while the command executes, use the
’’shell’’ command instead.

clear physical|ipcp|ipv6
[current|overall|peak...]

Clear the specified throughput
values at either the ’’physical’’,
’’ipcp’’ or
’’ipv6cp’’ level. If
’’physical’’ is specified, context
must be given (see the ’’link’’
command below). If no second argument is given, all values
are cleared.

clone name 
[,name]...

Clone the specified link,
creating one or more new links according to the name
argument(s). This command must be used from the
’’link’’ command below unless
you’ve only got a single link (in which case that link
becomes the default). Links may be removed using the
’’remove’’ command below.

The default
link name is ’’deflink’’.

close [lcp|ccp[!]]

If no arguments are given, the
relevant protocol layers will be brought down and the link
will be closed. If ’’lcp’’ is
specified, the LCP layer is brought down, but ppp
will not bring the link offline. It is subsequently possible
to use ’’term’’ (see below) to talk
to the peer machine if, for example, something like
’’slirp’’ is being used. If
’’ccp’’ is specified, only the
relevant compression layer is closed. If the
’’!’’ is used, the compression layer
will remain in the closed state, otherwise it will re-enter
the STOPPED state, waiting for the peer to initiate further
CCP negotiation. In any event, this command does not
disconnect the user from ppp or exit ppp. See
the ’’quit’’ command below.

delete 
[!] dest

This command deletes the route
with the given dest IP address. If dest is
specified as ’ALL’, all non-direct entries in
the routing table for the current interface, and all
’sticky route’ entries are deleted. If
dest is specified as ’default’, the
default route is deleted.

If the
delete! command is used (note the trailing
’’!’’), ppp will not complain
if the route does not already exist.

dial|call [label] 
...

This command is the equivalent
of ’’load label’’ followed by
’’open’’, and is provided for
backwards compatibility.

down [lcp|ccp]

Bring the relevant layer down
ungracefully, as if the underlying layer had become
unavailable. It’s not considered polite to use this
command on a Finite State Machine that’s in the OPEN
state. If no arguments are supplied, the entire link is
closed (or if no context is given, all links are
terminated). If ’lcp’ is specified, the
LCP layer is terminated but the device is not brought
offline and the link is not closed. If ’ccp’ is
specified, only the relevant compression layer(s) are
terminated.

help|? [command]

Show a list of available
commands. If command is specified, show the usage
string for that command.

ident [text...]

Identify the link to the peer
using text. If text is empty, link
identification is disabled. It is possible to use any of the
words described for the bg command above. Refer to
the sendident command for details of when ppp
identifies itself to the peer.

iface command [args]

This command is used to control
the interface used by ppp. Command may be one
of the following:

iface add 
[!] addr[/bits] [peer]

iface add 
[!] addr mask peer

Add the given addr mask
peer combination to the interface. Instead of specifying
mask, /bits can be used (with no space between
it and addr). If the given address already exists,
the command fails unless the ’’!’’
is used - in which case the previous interface address entry
is overwritten with the new one, allowing a change of
netmask or peer address.

If only
addr is specified, bits defaults to
’’32’’ and peer defaults to
’’255.255.255.255’’. This address
(the broadcast address) is the only duplicate peer address
that ppp allows.

iface clear [INET | INET6]

If this command is used while
ppp is in the OPENED state or while in
−auto mode, all addresses except for the NCP
negotiated address are deleted from the interface. If
ppp is not in the OPENED state and is not in
−auto mode, all interface addresses are
deleted.

If the INET or
INET6 arguments are used, only addresses for that address
family are cleared.

iface delete 
[!]|rm[!] addr

This command deletes the given
addr from the interface. If the
’’!’’ is used, no error is given if
the address isn’t currently assigned to the interface
(and no deletion takes place).

iface show

Shows the current state and
current addresses for the interface. It is much the same as
running ’’ifconfig INTERFACE’’.

iface help
[sub-command]

This command, when invoked
without sub-command, will show a list of possible
’’iface’’ sub-commands and a brief
synopsis for each. When invoked with sub-command,
only the synopsis for the given sub-command is shown.

[data] 
link name[,name]... command
[args]

This command may prefix any
other command if the user wishes to specify which link the
command should affect. This is only applicable after
multiple links have been created in Multi-link mode using
the ’’clone’’ command.

Name
specifies the name of an existing link. If name is a
comma separated list, command is executed on each
link. If name is ’’*’’,
command is executed on all links.

load [label] 
...

Load the given label(s)
from the ppp.conf file. If label is not given,
the default label is used.

Unless the
label section uses the ’’set
mode’’, ’’open’’ or
’’dial’’ commands, ppp will
not attempt to make an immediate connection.

log word...

Send the given word(s) to the
log file with the prefix ’’LOG:’’.
Word substitutions are done as explained under the
’’!bg’’ command above.

open [lcp|ccp|ipcp]

This is the opposite of the
’’close’’ command. All closed links
are immediately brought up apart from second and subsequent
demand-dial links - these will come up based on the
’’set autoload’’ command that has
been used.

If the
’’lcp’’ argument is used while the
LCP layer is already open, LCP will be renegotiated. This
allows various LCP options to be changed, after which
’’open lcp’’ can be used to put them
into effect. After renegotiating LCP, any agreed
authentication will also take place.

If the
’’ccp’’ argument is used, the
relevant compression layer is opened. Again, if it is
already open, it will be renegotiated.

If the
’’ipcp’’ argument is used, the link
will be brought up as normal, but if IPCP is already open,
it will be renegotiated and the network interface will be
reconfigured.

It is probably
not good practice to re-open the PPP state machines like
this as it’s possible that the peer will not behave
correctly. It is however useful as a way of forcing
the CCP or VJ dictionaries to be reset.

passwd pass

Specify the password required
for access to the full ppp command set. This password
is required when connecting to the diagnostic port (see the
’’set server’’ command). Pass
is specified on the ’’set server’’
command line. The value of pass is not logged when
command logging is active, instead, the literal
string ’********’ is logged.

quit|bye [all]

If
’’quit’’ is executed from the
controlling connection or from a command file, ppp will exit
after closing all connections. Otherwise, if the user is
connected to a diagnostic socket, the connection is simply
dropped.

If the
all argument is given, ppp will exit despite
the source of the command after closing all existing
connections.

remove|rm

This command removes the given
link. It is only really useful in multi-link mode. A link
must be in the CLOSED state before it is removed.

rename|mv name

This command renames the given
link to name. It will fail if name is already
used by another link.

The default
link name is ’deflink’. Renaming it to
’modem’, ’cuaa0’ or
’USR’ may make the log file more readable.

resolv command

This command controls
ppp’s manipulation of the resolv.conf(5) file.
When ppp starts up, it loads the contents of this
file into memory and retains this image for future use.
command is one of the following:

readonly

Treat
/etc/resolv.conf as read only. If
’’dns’’ is enabled, ppp will
still attempt to negotiate nameservers with the peer, making
the results available via the DNS0 and DNS1 macros. This is
the opposite of the ’’resolv
writable’’ command.

reload

Reload
/etc/resolv.conf into memory. This may be necessary
if for example a DHCP client overwrote
/etc/resolv.conf.

restore

Replace
/etc/resolv.conf with the version originally read at
startup or with the last ’’resolv
reload’’ command. This is sometimes a useful
command to put in the /etc/ppp/ppp.linkdown file.

rewrite

Rewrite the
/etc/resolv.conf file. This command will work even if
the ’’resolv readonly’’ command has
been used. It may be useful as a command in the
/etc/ppp/ppp.linkup file if you wish to defer
updating /etc/resolv.conf until after other commands
have finished.

writable

Allow
ppp to update /etc/resolv.conf if
’’dns’’ is enabled and ppp
successfully negotiates a DNS. This is the opposite of the
’’resolv readonly’’ command.

save

This option is not (yet)
implemented.

sendident

This command tells ppp
to identify itself to the peer. The link must be in LCP
state or higher. If no identity has been set (via the
ident command), sendident will fail.

When an
identity has been set, ppp will automatically
identify itself when it sends or receives a configure
reject, when negotiation fails or when LCP reaches the
opened state.

Received
identification packets are logged to the LCP log (see set
log for details) and are never responded to.

set 
[up] var value

This option allows the setting
of any of the following variables:

set accmap hex-value

ACCMap stands for Asynchronous
Control Character Map. This is always negotiated with the
peer, and defaults to a value of 00000000 in hex. This
protocol is required to defeat hardware that depends on
passing certain characters from end to end (such as XON/XOFF
etc).

For the
XON/XOFF scenario, use ’’set accmap
000a0000’’.

set [auth] 
key value

This sets the authentication
key (or password) used in client mode PAP or CHAP
negotiation to the given value. It also specifies the
password to be used in the dial or login scripts in place of
the ’\P’ sequence, preventing the actual
password from being logged. If command or chat
logging is in effect, value is logged as
’********’ for security reasons.

If the first
character of value is an exclamation mark
(’’!’’), ppp treats the
remainder of the string as a program that must be executed
to determine the ’’authname’’ and
’’authkey’’ values.

If the
’’!’’ is doubled up (to
’’!!’’), it is treated as a single
literal ’’!’’, otherwise, ignoring
the ’’!’’, value is parsed as
a program to execute in the same was as the
’’!bg’’ command above, substituting
special names in the same manner. Once executed, ppp
will feed the program three lines of input, each terminated
by a newline character:

•

The host name as sent in the
CHAP challenge.

•

The challenge string as sent in
the CHAP challenge.

•

The locally defined
’’authname’’.

Two lines of
output are expected:

•

The
’’authname’’ to be sent with the
CHAP response.

•

The
’’authkey’’, which is encrypted with
the challenge and request id, the answer being sent in the
CHAP response packet.

When
configuring ppp in this manner, it’s expected
that the host challenge is a series of ASCII digits or
characters. An encryption device or Secure ID card is
usually required to calculate the secret appropriate for the
given challenge.

set authname id

This sets the authentication id
used in client mode PAP or CHAP negotiation.

If used in
−direct mode with CHAP enabled, id is
used in the initial authentication challenge and should
normally be set to the local machine name.

set autoload 
min-percent max-percent period

These settings apply only in
multi-link mode and default to zero, zero and five
respectively. When more than one demand-dial (also
known as −auto) mode link is available, only
the first link is made active when ppp first reads
data from the tun device. The next demand-dial link
will be opened only when the current bundle throughput is at
least max-percent percent of the total bundle
bandwidth for period seconds. When the current bundle
throughput decreases to min-percent percent or less
of the total bundle bandwidth for period seconds, a
demand-dial link will be brought down as long as
it’s not the last active link.

Bundle
throughput is measured as the maximum of inbound and
outbound traffic.

The default
values cause demand-dial links to simply come up one
at a time.

Certain devices
cannot determine their physical bandwidth, so it is
sometimes necessary to use the ’’set
bandwidth’’ command (described below) to make
’’set autoload’’ work correctly.

set bandwidth value

This command sets the
connection bandwidth in bits per second. value must
be greater than zero. It is currently only used by the
’’set autoload’’ command above.

set callback
option...

If no arguments are given,
callback is disabled, otherwise, ppp will request (or
in −direct mode, will accept) one of the given
options. In client mode, if an option is
NAK’d ppp will request a different
option, until no options remain at which point
ppp will terminate negotiations (unless
’’none’’ is one of the specified
option). In server mode, ppp will accept any
of the given protocols - but the client must request
one of them. If you wish callback to be optional, you must
include none as an option.

The
options are as follows (in this order of
preference):

auth

The callee is
expected to decide the callback number based on
authentication. If ppp is the callee, the number
should be specified as the fifth field of the peers entry in
/etc/ppp/ppp.secret.

cbcp

Microsoft’s
callback control protocol is used. See ’’set
cbcp’’ below.

If you wish to
negotiate cbcp in client mode but also wish to allow
the server to request no callback at CBCP negotiation time,
you must specify both cbcp and none as
callback options.

E.164 *| 
number[,number]...

The caller specifies the
number. If ppp is the callee, number
should be either a comma separated list of allowable numbers
or a ’’*’’, meaning any number is
permitted. If ppp is the caller, only a single number
should be specified.

Note, this
option is very unsafe when used with a
’’*’’ as a malicious caller can tell
ppp to call any (possibly international) number
without first authenticating themselves.

none

If the peer
does not wish to do callback at all, ppp will accept
the fact and continue without callback rather than
terminating the connection. This is required (in addition to
one or more other callback options) if you wish callback to
be optional.

set cbcp [ 
*|number[ 
,number...] [delay [retry]]]

If no arguments are given, CBCP
(Microsoft’s CallBack Control Protocol) is disabled -
ie, configuring CBCP in the ’’set
callback’’ command will result in ppp
requesting no callback in the CBCP phase. Otherwise,
ppp attempts to use the given phone
number(s).

In server mode
(−direct), ppp will insist that the
client uses one of these numbers, unless
’’*’’ is used in which case the
client is expected to specify the number.

In client mode,
ppp will attempt to use one of the given numbers
(whichever it finds to be agreeable with the peer), or if
’’*’’ is specified, ppp will
expect the peer to specify the number.

set cd [ 
off|seconds[!]]

Normally, ppp checks for
the existence of carrier depending on the type of device
that has been opened:

Terminal Devices

Carrier is checked one second
after the login script is complete. If it’s not set,
ppp assumes that this is because the device
doesn’t support carrier (which is true for most
’’laplink’’ NULL-modem cables), logs
the fact and stops checking for carrier.

As ptys
don’t support the TIOCMGET ioctl, the tty device will
switch all carrier detection off when it detects that the
device is a pty.

ISDN (i4b) Devices

Carrier is checked once per
second for 6 seconds. If it’s not set after the sixth
second, the connection attempt is considered to have failed
and the device is closed. Carrier is always required for i4b
devices.

PPPoE (netgraph) Devices

Carrier is checked once per
second for 5 seconds. If it’s not set after the fifth
second, the connection attempt is considered to have failed
and the device is closed. Carrier is always required for
PPPoE devices.

All other
device types don’t support carrier. Setting a carrier
value will result in a warning when the device is
opened.

Some modems
take more than one second after connecting to assert the
carrier signal. If this delay isn’t increased, this
will result in ppp’s inability to detect when
the link is dropped, as ppp assumes that the device
isn’t asserting carrier.

The
’’set cd’’ command overrides the
default carrier behaviour. seconds specifies the
maximum number of seconds that ppp should wait after
the dial script has finished before deciding if carrier is
available or not.

If
’’off’’ is specified, ppp
will not check for carrier on the device, otherwise
ppp will not proceed to the login script until either
carrier is detected or until seconds has elapsed, at
which point ppp assumes that the device will not set
carrier.

If no arguments
are given, carrier settings will go back to their default
values.

If
seconds is followed immediately by an exclamation
mark (’’!’’), ppp will
require carrier. If carrier is not detected after
seconds seconds, the link will be disconnected.

set choked [timeout]

This sets the number of seconds
that ppp will keep a choked output queue before
dropping all pending output packets. If timeout is
less than or equal to zero or if timeout isn’t
specified, it is set to the default value of 120
seconds.

A choked output
queue occurs when ppp has read a certain number of
packets from the local network for transmission, but cannot
send the data due to link failure (the peer is busy etc.).
ppp will not read packets indefinitely. Instead, it
reads up to 30 packets (or 30 + nlinks
* 2 packets in multi-link mode), then stops reading
the network interface until either timeout seconds
have passed or at least one packet has been sent.

If
timeout seconds pass, all pending output packets are
dropped.

set ctsrts|crtscts on|off

This sets hardware flow
control. Hardware flow control is on by default.

set deflate out-winsize
[in-winsize]

This sets the DEFLATE
algorithms default outgoing and incoming window sizes. Both
out-winsize and in-winsize must be values
between 8 and 15. If in-winsize is
specified, ppp will insist that this window size is
used and will not accept any other values from the peer.

set dns [primary
[secondary]]

This command specifies DNS
overrides for the ’’accept dns’’
command. Refer to the ’’accept’’
command description above for details. This command does not
affect the IP numbers requested using ’’enable
dns’’.

set device|line 
value...

This sets the device(s) to
which ppp will talk to the given
’’value’’.

All ISDN and
serial device names are expected to begin with /dev/.
ISDN devices are usually called i4brbchX and serial
devices are usually called cuaXX.

If
’’value’’ does not begin with
/dev/, it must either begin with an exclamation mark
(’’!’’), be of the format
PPPoE:iface

[:provider] (on netgraph(4) enabled systems), or
be of the format host:port[/tcp|udp].

If it begins
with an exclamation mark, the rest of the device name is
treated as a program name, and that program is executed when
the device is opened. Standard input, output and error are
fed back to ppp and are read and written as if they
were a regular device.

If a
PPPoE:iface

[:provider] specification is given, ppp
will attempt to create a PPP over Ethernet connection
using the given iface interface by using netgraph(4).
If netgraph(4) is not available, ppp will attempt to
load it using kldload(2). If this fails, an external program
must be used such as the pppoed(8) program available under
OpenBSD. The given provider is passed as the service
name in the PPPoE Discovery Initiation (PADI) packet. If no
provider is given, an empty value will be used.

When a PPPoE
connection is established, ppp will place the name of
the Access Concentrator in the environment variable
ACNAME.

Refer to
netgraph(4) and ng_pppoe(4) for further details.

If a
host:port[

/tcp|udp ] specification is given, ppp will
attempt to connect to the given host on the given
port. If a ’’/tcp’’ or
’’/udp’’ suffix is not provided, the
default is ’’/tcp’’. Refer to the
section on PPP OVER TCP and UDP above for further
details.

If multiple
’’values’’ are specified, ppp
will attempt to open each one in turn until it succeeds or
runs out of devices.

set dial chat-script

This specifies the chat script
that will be used to dial the other side. See also the
’’set login’’ command below. Refer
to chat(8) and to the example configuration files for
details of the chat script format. It is possible to specify
some special ’values’ in your chat script as
follows:

\c

When used as
the last character in a ’send’ string, this
indicates that a newline should not be appended.

\d

When the chat
script encounters this sequence, it delays two seconds.

\p

When the chat
script encounters this sequence, it delays for one quarter
of a second.

\n

This is
replaced with a newline character.

\r

This is
replaced with a carriage return character.

\s

This is
replaced with a space character.

\t

This is
replaced with a tab character.

\T

This is
replaced by the current phone number (see ’’set
phone’’ below).

\P

This is
replaced by the current authkey value (see
’’set authkey’’ above).

\U

This is
replaced by the current authname value (see
’’set authname’’ above).

Note that two
parsers will examine these escape sequences, so in order to
have the ’chat parser’ see the escape character,
it is necessary to escape it from the ’command
parser’. This means that in practice you should use
two escapes, for example:

set dial
"... ATDT\\T CONNECT"

It is also
possible to execute external commands from the chat script.
To do this, the first character of the expect or send string
is an exclamation mark (’’!’’). If a
literal exclamation mark is required, double it up to
’’!!’’ and it will be treated as a
single literal ’’!’’. When the
command is executed, standard input and standard output are
directed to the open device (see the ’’set
device’’ command), and standard error is read by
ppp and substituted as the expect or send string. If
ppp is running in interactive mode, file descriptor 3
is attached to /dev/tty.

For example
(wrapped for readability):

set login
"TIMEOUT 5 \"\" \"\" login:--login:
ppp \ 
word: ppp \"!sh \\-c \\\"echo \\-n label:
>&2\\\"\" \ 
\"!/bin/echo in\" HELLO"

would result in
the following chat sequence (output using the ’set log
local chat’ command before dialing):

Dial attempt 1
of 1 
dial OK! 
Chat: Expecting: 
Chat: Sending: 
Chat: Expecting: login:--login: 
Chat: Wait for (5): login: 
Chat: Sending: ppp 
Chat: Expecting: word: 
Chat: Wait for (5): word: 
Chat: Sending: ppp 
Chat: Expecting: !sh \-c "echo \-n label:
>&2" 
Chat: Exec: sh -c "echo -n label: >&2" 
Chat: Wait for (5): !sh \-c "echo \-n label:
>&2" --> label: 
Chat: Exec: /bin/echo in 
Chat: Sending: 
Chat: Expecting: HELLO 
Chat: Wait for (5): HELLO 
login OK!

Note (again)
the use of the escape character, allowing many levels of
nesting. Here, there are four parsers at work. The first
parses the original line, reading it as three arguments. The
second parses the third argument, reading it as 11
arguments. At this point, it is important that the
’’-’’ signs are escaped, otherwise
this parser will see them as constituting an
expect-send-expect sequence. When the
’’!’’ character is seen, the
execution parser reads the first command as three arguments,
and then sh(1) itself expands the argument after the
−c. As we wish to send the output back to the
modem, in the first example we redirect our output to file
descriptor 2 (stderr) so that ppp itself sends and
logs it, and in the second example, we just output to
stdout, which is attached directly to the modem.

This, of course
means that it is possible to execute an entirely external
’’chat’’ command rather than using
the internal one. See chat(8) for a good alternative.

The external
command that is executed is subjected to the same special
word expansions as the ’’!bg’’
command.

set enddisc
[label|IP|MAC|magic|psn value]

This command sets our local
endpoint discriminator. If set prior to LCP negotiation, and
if no ’’disable enddisc’’ command
has been used, ppp will send the information to the
peer using the LCP endpoint discriminator option. The
following discriminators may be set:

label

The current
label is used.

IP

Our local IP
number is used. As LCP is negotiated prior to IPCP, it is
possible that the IPCP layer will subsequently change this
value. If it does, the endpoint discriminator stays at the
old value unless manually reset.

MAC

This is similar
to the IP option above, except that the MAC address
associated with the local IP number is used. If the local IP
number is not resident on any Ethernet interface, the
command will fail.

As the local IP
number defaults to whatever the machine host name is,
’’set enddisc mac’’ is usually done
prior to any ’’set ifaddr’’
commands.

magic

A 20 digit
random number is used. Care should be taken when using magic
numbers as restarting ppp or creating a link using a
different ppp invocation will also use a different
magic number and will therefore not be recognised by the
peer as belonging to the same bundle. This makes it
unsuitable for −direct connections.

psn value

The given value is used.
Value should be set to an absolute public switched
network number with the country code first.

If no arguments
are given, the endpoint discriminator is reset.

set escape value...

This option is similar to the
’’set accmap’’ option above. It
allows the user to specify a set of characters that will be
’escaped’ as they travel across the link.

set filter dial|alive|in|out
rule-no 
permit|deny|clear|rule-no [!] [ 
[host] src_addr[/width]
[dst_addr[/width]]] [proto [src
lt|eq|gt port] [dst lt|eq|gt port] [estab]
[syn] [finrst] [timeout secs]]

ppp supports four filter
sets. The alive filter specifies packets that keep
the connection alive - resetting the idle timer. The
dial filter specifies packets that cause ppp
to dial when in −auto mode. The in
filter specifies packets that are allowed to travel into the
machine and the out filter specifies packets that are
allowed out of the machine.

Filtering is
done prior to any IP alterations that might be done by the
NAT engine on outgoing packets and after any IP alterations
that might be done by the NAT engine on incoming packets. By
default all empty filter sets allow all packets to pass.
Rules are processed in order according to rule-no
(unless skipped by specifying a rule number as the
action). Up to 40 rules may be given for each set. If
a packet doesn’t match any of the rules in a given
set, it is discarded. In the case of in and
out filters, this means that the packet is dropped.
In the case of alive filters it means that the packet
will not reset the idle timer (even if the
in/out filter has a
’’timeout’’ value) and in the case
of dial filters it means that the packet will not
trigger a dial. A packet failing to trigger a dial will be
dropped rather than queued. Refer to the section on
PACKET FILTERING above for further details.

set hangup
chat-script

This specifies the chat script
that will be used to reset the device before it is closed.
It should not normally be necessary, but can be used for
devices that fail to reset themselves properly on close.

set help|? [command]

This command gives a summary of
available set commands, or if command is specified,
the command usage is shown.

set ifaddr [ 
myaddr[/nn] [ 
hisaddr[/nn] [ 
netmask [triggeraddr]]]]

This command specifies the IP
addresses that will be used during IPCP negotiation.
Addresses are specified using the format

a.b.c.d/nn

Where
’’a.b.c.d’’ is the preferred IP, but
nn specifies how many bits of the address we will
insist on. If /nn is omitted, it defaults to
’’/32’’ unless the IP address is
0.0.0.0 in which case it defaults to
’’/0’’.

If you wish to
assign a dynamic IP number to the peer, hisaddr may
also be specified as a range of IP numbers in the format

IP[

-IP][ 
,IP[-IP]]...

for
example:

set ifaddr
10.0.0.1 10.0.1.2-10.0.1.10,10.0.1.20

will only
negotiate ’’10.0.0.1’’ as the local
IP number, but may assign any of the given 10 IP numbers to
the peer. If the peer requests one of these numbers, and
that number is not already in use, ppp will grant the
peers request. This is useful if the peer wants to
re-establish a link using the same IP number as was
previously allocated (thus maintaining any existing tcp or
udp connections).

If the peer
requests an IP number that’s either outside of this
range or is already in use, ppp will suggest a random
unused IP number from the range.

If
triggeraddr is specified, it is used in place of
myaddr in the initial IPCP negotiation. However, only
an address in the myaddr range will be accepted. This
is useful when negotiating with some PPP implementations
that will not assign an IP number unless their peer requests
’’0.0.0.0’’.

It should be
noted that in −auto mode, ppp will
configure the interface immediately upon reading the
’’set ifaddr’’ line in the config
file. In any other mode, these values are just used for IPCP
negotiations, and the interface isn’t configured until
the IPCP layer is up.

Note that the
HISADDR argument may be overridden by the third field
in the ppp.secret file once the client has
authenticated itself (if PAP or CHAP are
’’enabled’’). Refer to the
AUTHENTICATING INCOMING CONNECTIONS section for
details.

In all cases,
if the interface is already configured, ppp will try
to maintain the interface IP numbers so that any existing
bound sockets will remain valid.

set ifqueue packets

Set the maximum number of
packets that ppp will read from the tunnel interface
while data cannot be sent to any of the available links.
This queue limit is necessary to flow control outgoing data
as the tunnel interface is likely to be far faster than the
combined links available to ppp.

If
packets is set to a value less than the number of
links, ppp will read up to that value regardless.
This prevents any possible latency problems.

The default
value for packets is
’’30’’.

set ccpretry|ccpretries [

timeout [reqtries [trmtries]]]

set chapretry|chapretries [

timeout [reqtries]]

set ipcpretry|ipcpretries [

timeout [reqtries [trmtries]]]

set ipv6cpretry|ipv6cpretries [

timeout [reqtries [trmtries]]]

set lcpretry|lcpretries [

timeout [reqtries [trmtries]]]

set papretry|papretries [

timeout [reqtries]]

These commands set the number
of seconds that ppp will wait before resending Finite
State Machine (FSM) Request packets. The default
timeout for all FSMs is 3 seconds (which should
suffice in most cases).

If
reqtries is specified, it tells ppp how many
configuration request attempts it should make while
receiving no reply from the peer before giving up. The
default is 5 attempts for CCP, LCP and IPCP and 3 attempts
for PAP and CHAP.

If
trmtries is specified, it tells ppp how many
terminate requests should be sent before giving up waiting
for the peers response. The default is 3 attempts.
Authentication protocols are not terminated and it is
therefore invalid to specify trmtries for PAP or
CHAP.

In order to
avoid negotiations with the peer that will never converge,
ppp will only send at most 3 times the configured
number of reqtries in any given negotiation session
before giving up and closing that layer.

set log 
[local] [+|-]value...

This command allows the
adjustment of the current log level. Refer to the Logging
Facility section for further details.

set login chat-script

This chat-script
compliments the dial-script. If both are specified, the
login script will be executed after the dial script. Escape
sequences available in the dial script are also available
here.

set logout
chat-script

This specifies the chat script
that will be used to logout before the hangup script is
called. It should not normally be necessary.

set lqrperiod
frequency

This command sets the
frequency in seconds at which LQR or ECHO
LQR packets are sent. The default is 30 seconds. You
must also use the ’’enable lqr’’
command if you wish to send LQR requests to the peer.

set mode
interactive|auto|ddial|background

This command allows you to
change the ’mode’ of the specified link. This is
normally only useful in multi-link mode, but may also be
used in uni-link mode.

It is not
possible to change a link that is ’direct’ or
’dedicated’.

Note: If you
issue the command ’’set mode auto’’,
and have network address translation enabled, it may be
useful to ’’enable iface-alias’’
afterwards. This will allow ppp to do the necessary
address translations to enable the process that triggers the
connection to connect once the link is up despite the peer
assigning us a new (dynamic) IP address.

set mppe [40|56|128|*
[stateless|stateful|*]]

This option selects the
encryption parameters used when negotiation MPPE. MPPE can
be disabled entirely with the ’’disable
mppe’’ command. If no arguments are given,
ppp will attempt to negotiate a stateful link with a
128 bit key, but will agree to whatever the peer requests
(including no encryption at all).

If any
arguments are given, ppp will insist on using
MPPE and will close the link if it’s rejected by the
peer (Note; this behaviour can be overridden by a configured
RADIUS server).

The first
argument specifies the number of bits that ppp should
insist on during negotiations and the second specifies
whether ppp should insist on stateful or stateless
mode. In stateless mode, the encryption dictionary is
re-initialised with every packet according to an encryption
key that is changed with every packet. In stateful mode, the
encryption dictionary is re-initialised every 256 packets or
after the loss of any data and the key is changed every 256
packets. Stateless mode is less efficient but is better for
unreliable transport layers.

set mrru [value]

Setting this option enables
Multi-link PPP negotiations, also known as Multi-link
Protocol or MP. There is no default MRRU (Maximum
Reconstructed Receive Unit) value. If no argument is given,
multi-link mode is disabled.

set mru 
[max[imum]] [value]

The default MRU (Maximum
Receive Unit) is 1500. If it is increased, the other side
*may* increase its MTU. In theory there is no point in
decreasing the MRU to below the default as the PPP
protocol says implementations *must* be able to accept
packets of at least 1500 octets.

If the
’’maximum’’ keyword is used,
ppp will refuse to negotiate a higher value. The
maximum MRU can be set to 2048 at most. Setting a maximum of
less than 1500 violates the PPP rfc, but may
sometimes be necessary. For example, PPPoE imposes a
maximum of 1492 due to hardware limitations.

If no argument
is given, 1500 is assumed. A value must be given when
’’maximum’’ is specified.

set mtu 
[max[imum]] [value]

The default MTU is 1500. At
negotiation time, ppp will accept whatever MRU the
peer requests (assuming it’s not less than 296 bytes
or greater than the assigned maximum). If the MTU is set,
ppp will not accept MRU values less than
value. When negotiations are complete, the MTU is
used when writing to the interface, even if the peer
requested a higher value MRU. This can be useful for
limiting your packet size (giving better bandwidth sharing
at the expense of more header data).

If the
’’maximum’’ keyword is used,
ppp will refuse to negotiate a higher value. The
maximum MTU can be set to 2048 at most. Note, it is
necessary to use the ’’maximum’’
keyword to limit the MTU when using PPPoE.

If no
value is given, 1500, or whatever the peer asks for
is used. A value must be given when
’’maximum’’ is specified.

set nbns [x.x.x.x
[y.y.y.y]]

This option allows the setting
of the Microsoft NetBIOS name server values to be returned
at the peers request. If no values are given, ppp
will reject any such requests.

set openmode active|passive
[delay]

By default, openmode is
always active with a one second delay. That
is, ppp will always initiate LCP/IPCP/CCP negotiation
one second after the line comes up. If you want to wait for
the peer to initiate negotiations, you can use the value
passive. If you want to initiate negotiations
immediately or after more than one second, the appropriate
delay may be specified here in seconds.

set parity
odd|even|none|mark

This allows the line parity to
be set. The default value is none.

set phone telno 
[ 
|backupnumber]...[ 
:nextnumber]...

This allows the specification
of the phone number to be used in place of the \\T string in
the dial and login chat scripts. Multiple phone numbers may
be given separated either by a pipe
(’’|’’) or a colon
(’’:’’).

Numbers after
the pipe are only dialed if the dial or login script for the
previous number failed.

Numbers after
the colon are tried sequentially, irrespective of the reason
the line was dropped.

If multiple
numbers are given, ppp will dial them according to
these rules until a connection is made, retrying the maximum
number of times specified by ’’set
redial’’ below. In −background
mode, each number is attempted at most once.

set pppoe [standard|3Com]

This option configures the
underlying ng_pppoe(4) node to either standard RFC2516 PPPoE
or proprietary 3Com mode. If not set the system default will
be used.

set [proc] 
title [value]

The current process title as
displayed by ps(1) is changed according to value. If
value is not specified, the original process title is
restored. All the word replacements done by the shell
commands (see the ’’bg’’ command
above) are done here too.

Note, if USER
is required in the process title, the ’’set
proctitle’’ command must appear in
ppp.linkup, as it is not known when the commands in
ppp.conf are executed.

set radius
[config-file]

This command enables RADIUS
support (if it’s compiled in). config-file
refers to the radius client configuration file as described
in radius.conf(5). If PAP, CHAP, MSCHAP or MSCHAPv2 are
’’enabled’’, ppp behaves as a
Network Access Server and uses the
configured RADIUS server to authenticate rather than
authenticating from the ppp.secret file or from the
passwd database.

If none of PAP,
CHAP, MSCHAP or MSCHAPv2 are enabled, ’’set
radius’’ will do nothing.

ppp uses
the following attributes from the RADIUS reply:

RAD_FRAMED_IP_ADDRESS

The peer IP address is set to
the given value.

RAD_FRAMED_IP_NETMASK

The tun interface netmask is
set to the given value.

RAD_FRAMED_MTU

If the given MTU is less than
the peers MRU as agreed during LCP negotiation, *and* it is
less that any configured MTU (see the ’’set
mru’’ command), the tun interface MTU is set to
the given value.

RAD_FRAMED_COMPRESSION

If the received compression
type is ’’1’’, ppp will
request VJ compression during IPCP negotiations despite any
’’disable vj’’ configuration
command.

RAD_FILTER_ID

If this attribute is supplied,
ppp will attempt to use it as an additional label to
load from the ppp.linkup and ppp.linkdown
files. The load will be attempted before (and in addition
to) the normal label search. If the label doesn’t
exist, no action is taken and ppp proceeds to the
normal load using the current label.

RAD_FRAMED_ROUTE

The received string is expected
to be in the format dest[/bits] gw
[metrics]. Any specified metrics are ignored. MYADDR
and HISADDR are understood as valid values for dest
and gw, ’’default’’ can be
used for dest to sepcify the default route, and
’’0.0.0.0’’ is understood to be the
same as ’’default’’ for dest
and HISADDR for gw.

For example, a
returned value of ’’1.2.3.4/24 0.0.0.0 1 2 -1 3
400’’ would result in a routing table entry to
the 1.2.3.0/24 network via HISADDR and a returned value of
’’0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0’’ or
’’default HISADDR’’ would result in
a default route to HISADDR.

All RADIUS
routes are applied after any sticky routes are applied,
making RADIUS routes override configured routes. This also
applies for RADIUS routes that don’t include the
MYADDR or HISADDR keywords.

RAD_FRAMED_IPV6_PREFIX

If this attribute is supplied,
the value is substituted for IPV6PREFIX in a command. You
may pass it to such as DHCPv6 for delegating an IPv6 prefix
to a peer.

RAD_FRAMED_IPV6_ROUTE

The received string is expected
to be in the format dest[/bits] gw
[metrics]. Any specified metrics are ignored. MYADDR6
and HISADDR6 are understood as valid values for dest
and gw, ’’default’’ can be
used for dest to sepcify the default route, and
’’::’’ is understood to be the same
as ’’default’’ for dest and
HISADDR6 for gw.

For example, a
returned value of ’’3ffe:505:abcd::/48
::’’ would result in a routing table entry to
the 3ffe:505:abcd::/48 network via HISADDR6 and a returned
value of ’’:: ::’’ or
’’default HISADDR6’’ would result in
a default route to HISADDR6.

All RADIUS IPv6
routes are applied after any sticky routes are applied,
making RADIUS IPv6 routes override configured routes. This
also applies for RADIUS IPv6 routes that don’t include
the MYADDR6 or HISADDR6 keywords.

RAD_SESSION_TIMEOUT

If supplied, the client
connection is closed after the given number of seconds.

RAD_REPLY_MESSAGE

If supplied, this message is
passed back to the peer as the authentication SUCCESS
text.

RAD_MICROSOFT_MS_CHAP_ERROR

If this RAD_VENDOR_MICROSOFT
vendor specific attribute is supplied, it is passed back to
the peer as the authentication FAILURE text.

RAD_MICROSOFT_MS_CHAP2_SUCCESS

If this RAD_VENDOR_MICROSOFT
vendor specific attribute is supplied and if MS-CHAPv2
authentication is being used, it is passed back to the peer
as the authentication SUCCESS text.

RAD_MICROSOFT_MS_MPPE_ENCRYPTION_POLICY

If this RAD_VENDOR_MICROSOFT
vendor specific attribute is supplied and has a value of 2
(Required), ppp will insist that MPPE encryption is
used (even if no ’’set mppe’’
configuration command has been given with arguments). If it
is supplied with a value of 1 (Allowed), encryption is made
optional (despite any ’’set mppe’’
configuration commands with arguments).

RAD_MICROSOFT_MS_MPPE_ENCRYPTION_TYPES

If this RAD_VENDOR_MICROSOFT
vendor specific attribute is supplied, bits 1 and 2 are
examined. If either or both are set, 40 bit and/or 128 bit
(respectively) encryption options are set, overriding any
given first argument to the ’’set
mppe’’ command. Note, it is not currently
possible for the RADIUS server to specify 56 bit
encryption.

RAD_MICROSOFT_MS_MPPE_RECV_KEY

If this RAD_VENDOR_MICROSOFT
vendor specific attribute is supplied, it’s value is
used as the master key for decryption of incoming data. When
clients are authenticated using MSCHAPv2, the RADIUS server
MUST provide this attribute if inbound MPPE is to
function.

RAD_MICROSOFT_MS_MPPE_SEND_KEY

If this RAD_VENDOR_MICROSOFT
vendor specific attribute is supplied, it’s value is
used as the master key for encryption of outgoing data. When
clients are authenticated using MSCHAPv2, the RADIUS server
MUST provide this attribute if outbound MPPE is to
function.

Values received
from the RADIUS server may be viewed using
’’show bundle’’.

set rad_alive timeout

When RADIUS is configured,
setting ’’rad_alive’’ to a non-zero
timeout value will tell ppp to sent RADIUS
accounting information to the RADIUS server every
timeout seconds.

set reconnect timeout
ntries

Should the line drop
unexpectedly (due to loss of CD or LQR failure), a
connection will be re-established after the given
timeout. The line will be re-connected at most
ntries times. Ntries defaults to zero. A value
of random for timeout will result in a
variable pause, somewhere between 1 and 30 seconds.

set recvpipe [value]

This sets the routing table
RECVPIPE value. The optimum value is just over twice the MTU
value. If value is unspecified or zero, the default
kernel controlled value is used.

set redial secs 
[ 
+inc[-max]][.next]
[attempts]

ppp can be instructed to
attempt to redial attempts times. If more than one
phone number is specified (see ’’set
phone’’ above), a pause of next is taken
before dialing each number. A pause of secs is taken
before starting at the first number again. A literal value
of ’’random’’ may be used here in
place of secs and next, causing a random delay
of between 1 and 30 seconds.

If inc
is specified, its value is added onto secs each time
ppp tries a new number. secs will only be
incremented at most max times. max defaults to
10.

Note, the
secs delay will be effective, even after
attempts has been exceeded, so an immediate manual
dial may appear to have done nothing. If an immediate dial
is required, a ’’!’’ should
immediately follow the ’’open’’
keyword. See the ’’open’’
description above for further details.

set sendpipe [value]

This sets the routing table
SENDPIPE value. The optimum value is just over twice the MTU
value. If value is unspecified or zero, the default
kernel controlled value is used.

set server|socket
TcpPort| 
LocalName|none|open|closed [password [mask]]

This command tells ppp
to listen on the given socket or ’diagnostic
port’ for incoming command connections.

The word
’’none’’ instructs ppp to
close any existing socket and clear the socket
configuration. The word ’’open’’
instructs ppp to attempt to re-open the port. The
word ’’closed’’ instructs ppp
to close the open port.

If you wish to
specify a local domain socket, LocalName must be
specified as an absolute file name, otherwise it is assumed
to be the name or number of a TCP port. You may specify the
octal umask to be used with a local domain socket. Refer to
umask(2) for umask details. Refer to services(5) for details
of how to translate TCP port names.

You must also
specify the password that must be entered by the client
(using the ’’passwd’’ variable
above) when connecting to this socket. If the password is
specified as an empty string, no password is required for
connecting clients.

When specifying
a local domain socket, the first
’’%d’’ sequence found in the socket
name will be replaced with the current interface unit
number. This is useful when you wish to use the same profile
for more than one connection.

In a similar
manner TCP sockets may be prefixed with the
’’+’’ character, in which case the
current interface unit number is added to the port
number.

When using
ppp with a server socket, the pppctl(8) command is
the preferred mechanism of communications. Currently,
telnet(1) can also be used, but link encryption may be
implemented in the future, so telnet(1) should be
avoided.

Note; SIGUSR1
and SIGUSR2 interact with the diagnostic socket.

set speed value

This sets the speed of the
serial device. If speed is specified as
’’sync’’, ppp treats the
device as a synchronous device.

Certain device
types will know whether they should be specified as
synchronous or asynchronous. These devices will override
incorrect settings and log a warning to this effect.

set stopped [LCPseconds
[CCPseconds]]

If this option is set,
ppp will time out after the given FSM (Finite State
Machine) has been in the stopped state for the given number
of ’’seconds’’. This option may be
useful if the peer sends a terminate request, but never
actually closes the connection despite our sending a
terminate acknowledgement. This is also useful if you wish
to ’’set openmode passive’’ and time
out if the peer doesn’t send a Configure Request
within the given time. Use ’’set log +lcp
+ccp’’ to make ppp log the appropriate
state transitions.

The default
value is zero, where ppp doesn’t time out in
the stopped state.

This value
should not be set to less than the openmode delay (see
’’set openmode’’ above).

set timeout idleseconds
[mintimeout]

This command allows the setting
of the idle timer. Refer to the section titled SETTING
THE IDLE TIMER for further details.

If
mintimeout is specified, ppp will never idle
out before the link has been up for at least that number of
seconds.

set urgent 
[tcp|udp|none] [ 
[+|-]port] ...

This command controls the ports
that ppp prioritizes when transmitting data. The
default priority TCP ports are ports 21 (ftp control), 22
(ssh), 23 (telnet), 513 (login), 514 (shell), 543 (klogin)
and 544 (kshell). There are no priority UDP ports by
default. See services(5) for details.

If neither
’’tcp’’ or
’’udp’’ are specified,
’’tcp’’ is assumed.

If no
ports are given, the priority port lists are cleared
(although if ’’tcp’’ or
’’udp’’ is specified, only that list
is cleared). If the first port argument is prefixed
with a plus (’’+’’) or a minus
(’’-’’), the current list is
adjusted, otherwise the list is reassigned. ports
prefixed with a plus or not prefixed at all are added to the
list and ports prefixed with a minus are removed from
the list.

If
’’none’’ is specified, all priority
port lists are disabled and even IPTOS_LOWDELAY packets are
not prioritised.

set vj slotcomp on|off

This command tells ppp
whether it should attempt to negotiate VJ slot compression.
By default, slot compression is turned on.

set vj slots nslots

This command sets the initial
number of slots that ppp will try to negotiate with
the peer when VJ compression is enabled (see the
’enable’ command above). It defaults to a value
of 16. Nslots must be between 4 and 16
inclusive.

shell|! [command]

If command is not
specified a shell is invoked according to the SHELL
environment variable. Otherwise, the given command is
executed. Word replacement is done in the same way as for
the ’’!bg’’ command as described
above.

Use of the !
character requires a following space as with any of the
other commands. You should note that this command is
executed in the foreground; ppp will not continue
running until this process has exited. Use the bg command if
you wish processing to happen in the background.

FILES

ppp refers to four files:
ppp.conf, ppp.linkup, ppp.linkdown and
ppp.secret. These files are placed in the
/etc/ppp directory.

/etc/ppp/ppp.conf

System default configuration
file.

/etc/ppp/ppp.secret

An authorisation file for each
system.

/etc/ppp/ppp.linkup

A file to check when ppp
establishes a network level connection.

/etc/ppp/ppp.linkdown

A file to check when ppp
closes a network level connection.

/var/log/ppp.log

Logging and debugging
information file. Note, this name is specified in
/etc/syslog.conf. See syslog.conf(5) for further
details.

/var/spool/lock/LCK..*

tty port locking file. Refer to
uucplock(3) for further details.

/var/run/tunN.pid

The process id (pid) of the
ppp program connected to the tunN device, where
’N’ is the number of the device.

/var/run/ttyXX.if

The tun interface used by this
port. Again, this file is only created in
−background, −auto and
−ddial modes.

/etc/services

Get port number if port number
is using service name.

/var/run/ppp-authname-class-value

In multi-link mode, local
domain sockets are created using the peer authentication
name (’authname’), the peer endpoint
discriminator class (’class’) and the peer
endpoint discriminator value (’value’). As the
endpoint discriminator value may be a binary value, it is
turned to HEX to determine the actual file name.

This socket is
used to pass links between different instances of
ppp.

HISTORY

This program was originally
written by Toshiharu OHNO tony-o [AT] iij.jp>, and was
submitted to FreeBSD 2.0.5 by Atsushi Murai
amurai [AT] spec.jp>.

It was
substantially modified during 1997 by Brian Somers
brian [AT] Awfulhak.org>, and was ported to OpenBSD in
November that year (just after the 2.2 release).

Most of the code
was rewritten by Brian Somers in early 1998 when multi-link
ppp support was added.
