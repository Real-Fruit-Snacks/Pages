NAME

keycap — keyboard
mapping data base

SYNOPSIS

keycap

DESCRIPTION

The keycap file is a data
base describing keyboard mappings, used by kcon(1).

Entries in
keycap consist of a number of
’:’-separated fields. The first entry for each
mapping gives the names that are known for the mapping,
separated by ’|’ characters. All names but the
first and last should be in lower case and contain no
blanks; the last name may well contain upper case and blanks
for readability.
