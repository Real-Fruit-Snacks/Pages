NAME

chroot âˆ’
change root directory for a command

SYNOPSIS

/usr/sbin/chroot
newroot command

DESCRIPTION

The
chroot utility causes command to be executed
relative to newroot. The meaning of any initial
slashes (|) in the path names is changed to
newroot for command and any of its child
processes. Upon execution, the initial working directory is
newroot.

Notice that
redirecting the output of command to a file,

chroot
newroot command >x

will create the
file x relative to the original root of
command, not the new one.

The new root
path name is always relative to the current root. Even if a
chroot is currently in effect, the newroot
argument is relative to the current root of the running
process.

This command
can be run only by the super-user.

RETURN VALUES

The exit status
of chroot is the return value of command.

EXAMPLES

Example 1:
Using the chroot utility.

The
chroot utility provides an easy way to extract
tar files (see tar(1)) written with absolute
filenames to a different location:

example#
cp /usr/sbin/static/tar /tmp 
example# dd if=/dev/nrst0 | chroot /tmp tar xvf
-

Note that
tar is statically linked, so it is not necessary to
copy any shared libraries to the newroot
filesystem.

NOTES

Exercise
extreme caution when referencing device files in the new
root file system.

References by
routines such as ttyname(3C) to stdin, stdout, and
stderr will find that the device associated with the file
descriptor is unknown after chroot is run.
