RELEASE NOTES FOR VIRT-P2V 1.42.0

These release
notes only cover the differences from the previous version.
For detailed changelogs, please see the git repository.

&bull;

The "rhv-upload" output mode of virt-v2v is
not listed as output driver, as virt-p2v does not provide
all the GUI elements to properly use it (Pino
Toscano). 

&bull;

Virt-v2v is checked as requirement for the functional
tests, in addition to guestfish, and virt-customize (Pino
Toscano). 

&bull;

Virt-p2v-make-disk now sets "p2v.local" as
hostname in the generated disk image (Pino Toscano).

&bull;

Document "p2v" as initial password for the
root user on the disk image generated by virt-p2v-make-disk,
virt-p2v-make-kickstart, and virt-p2v-make-kiwi (Pino
Toscano). 

RELEASE NOTES FOR VIRT-P2V 1.41.0

This is the
first standalone release of virt-p2v, split from the
libguestfs sources.

There are no
functionality changes compared to virt-p2v shipped as part
of libguestfs 1.40.
