NAME

select −
For each component of a vector type, result[i] = if MSB of
c[i] is set ? b[i] : a[i]. For scalar type, result = c ? b :
a.

 gentype select(gentype a, gentype b, igentype c);gentype select(gentype a, gentype b, ugentype c);DESCRIPTION

For each component of a vector
type, result[i] = if MSB of c[i] is set
? b[i] : a[i].

For scalar
type, result = c ? b : a.

igentype
and ugentype must have the same number of elements
and bits as gentype.

NOTES

The argment
type gentype can be char,
charn,uchar, ucharn,
short, shortn, ushort,
ushortn, int, intn,
uint, uintn, long,
longn, ulong, ulongn,
float, floatn, double, and
doublen.

The argument
type igentype refers to signed integer types, i.e.
char, charn, short,
shortn, int, intn,
long, and longn.

The argument
type ugentype refers to unsigned integer types, i.e.
uchar, ucharn, ushort,
ushortn, uint, uintn,
ulong, and ulongn. n is 2, 3, 4,
8, or 16.

If an
implementation extends this specification to support
IEEE−754 flags or exceptions, then all built−in
relational functions shall proceed without raising the
invalid floating−point exception when one or
more of the operands are NaNs.

The
built−in relational functions are extended with
cl_khr_fp16(3clc) to include appropriate versions of
functions that take half, and half{2|3|4|8|16}
as arguments and return values.
