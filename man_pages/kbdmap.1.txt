kbdmap, vidfont
&mdash; front end for syscons

SYNOPSIS

kbdmap [&minus;K]
[&minus;V]
[&minus;d | &minus;default]
[&minus;h | &minus;help]

[&minus;p | &minus;print]

DESCRIPTION

The kbdmap utility allows
easy setting of available keymaps. The vidfont
command allows the setting of fonts. Both examine a database
for the keymaps and fonts. Descriptions are in English by
default, but may also be in other languages. These programs
are interactive and expect to run in a terminal to get
required input (e.g., a keymap selection) from the user.

It is strongly
recommended to not choose MSDOS codepage keymaps or fonts.
Use the ISO standard version if available! X11 does not
support MSDOS codepage.

The following
options are available:

&minus;K

Run as command
kbdmap.

&minus;V

Run as command
vidfont.

&minus;d,
&minus;default

Use default language. Ignore
LANG environment variable.

&minus;h,
&minus;help

Print options and exit.

&minus;l,
&minus;lang language

Use language for
description and menu

&minus;p,
&minus;print

Print description of available
keymaps or fonts to stdout and exit.

&minus;r,
&minus;restore

Load default font from
/etc/rc.conf.

&minus;s,
&minus;show

Show currently supported
languages and exit.
