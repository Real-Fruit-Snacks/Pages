NAME
       pamhue - change a Netpbm image's hues

SYNOPSIS
       pamhue [-huechange=[degrees]] filename

       Minimum  unique abbreviation of option is acceptable.  You may use dou-
       ble hyphens instead of single hyphen to denote options.   You  may  use
       white space in place of the equals sign to separate an option name from
       its value.

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       pamhue shifts the hue of every pixel in an image by the same amount.

       If the image is in a black and white or grayscale format, the image  is
       fully  desaturated, so the hue is meaningless and pamhue leaves the im-
       age unchanged.

       Hue-Saturation-Value, or HSV, is one way to represent a color, like the
       more  well-known RGB.  Hue is an indication of the secondary color with
       the same brightness that most closely approximates the color.   A  sec-
       ondary  color  is  made  of a combination of at most two of the primary
       colors.

       In the HSV model, hue is an angular position on the color wheel.

       With pamhue, you indicate an angle by which to change all the  hues  in
       the  image; for example you can say move it 60 degrees clockwise.  That
       would change all red pixels to yellow and all yellow pixels  to  green,
       etc.

       To  modify  the saturation and value components of the colors, use pam-
       brighten.

EXAMPLES
       To shift the color of each pixel 120 degrees clockwise:
       pamhue -huechange=120

       To shift the color of each pixel 120 degrees counterclockwise:
       pamhue -huechange=-120

OPTIONS
       In addition to the options common to all programs  based  on  libnetpbm
       (most notably -quiet, see
        Common  Options  <index.html#commonoptions>  ),  pamhue recognizes the
       following command line option:

       -huechange=degrees
              This option specifies the amount to shift each color.  It is  in
              degrees,  with  positive  meaning clockwise and negative meaning
              counterclockwise.  It may be fractional and may be more  than  a
              full revolution.

              This option is mandatory.

HISTORY
       pamhue was new in Netpbm 10.86 (March 2019).
