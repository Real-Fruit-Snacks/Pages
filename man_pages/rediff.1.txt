NAME

rediff,
editdiff - fix offsets and counts of a hand-edited diff

SYNOPSIS

rediff ORIGINAL
EDITED 

rediff EDITED

rediff {[--help] |
[--version]} 

editdiff FILE

editdiff {[--help] |
[--version]} 

DESCRIPTION

You can use
rediff to correct a hand-edited unified diff. Take a copy of
the diff you want to edit, and edit it without changing any
offsets or counts (the lines that begin &ldquo;@@&rdquo;).
Then run rediff, telling it the name of the original diff
file and the name of the one you have edited, and it will
output the edited diff file but with corrected offsets and
counts.

A small script,
editdiff, is provided for editing a diff file in-place.

The types of
changes that are currently handled are:

&bull;
Modifying the text of any file content line (of course).

&bull; Adding
new line insertions or deletions.

&bull; Adding,
changing or removing context lines. Lines at the context
horizon are dealt with by adjusting the offset and/or
count.

&bull; Adding a
single hunk (@@-prefixed section).

&bull; Removing
multiple hunk (@@-prefixed sections).

Alternatively,
if only one argument is provided, it is taken to be the
edited file and the counts and offsets are adjusted as
appropriate. Some assumptions are made when used in this
mode. See recountdiff(1) for more information.
