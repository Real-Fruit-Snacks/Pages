UMODEM(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual UMODEM(4)

NAME

umodem — USB
Communication Device Class serial (CDC ACM) driver

SYNOPSIS

To compile this driver into the
kernel, place the following lines in your kernel
configuration file:

device usb

device ucom 
device umodem

Alternatively,
to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following line in loader.conf(5):

umodem_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION

The umodem driver
provides support for USB modems and serial devices that
implement the Communication Device Class Abstract Control
Model (CDC ACM). It also provides device-side CDC ACM
support. Supported modems are basically standard serial line
modems, but they are accessed via USB instead. They support
a regular AT command set. The commands can either be
multiplexed with the data stream or handled through separate
pipes. In the latter case the AT commands have to be given
on a device separate from the data device.

The device is
accessed through the ucom(4) driver which makes it behave
like a tty(4).
