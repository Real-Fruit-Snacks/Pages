DESCRIPTION

THIS IS OUT OF
DATE AND NEEDS REWORKING.

nmh can
use a wide range of message transport systems to deliver
mail. Although the nmh administrator usually
doesn&rsquo;t get to choose which MTS to use (since
it&rsquo;s already in place), this document briefly
describes the interfaces.

When
communicating with SendMail, nmh always uses
the SMTP to post mail. Depending on the nmh
configuration, SendMail may be invoked directly (via
a fork and an exec), or nmh may open a
TCP/IP connection to the SMTP server on the localhost.

When
communicating with zmailer, the SendMail
compatibility program is required to be installed in
/usr/lib. nmh communicates with zmailer by
using the SMTP. It does this by invoking the
/usr/lib/sendmail compatibility program directly,
with the &rsquo;&minus;bs&rsquo; option.

When
communicating with MMDF, normally nmh uses the
&ldquo;mm_&rdquo; routines to post mail. However, depending
on the nmh configuration, nmh instead may open
a TCP/IP connection to the SMTP server on the localhost.

If you are
running a UNIX system with TCP/IP networking, then it is
felt that the best interface is achieved by using either
SendMail or MMDF with the SMTP option. This
gives greater flexibility. To enable this option you append
the /smtp suffix to the mts option in the nmh
configuration. This yields two primary advantages: First,
you don&rsquo;t have to know where submit or
SendMail live. This means that nmh binaries
(e.g., post ) don&rsquo;t have to have this
information hard&minus;coded, or can run different programs
altogether; and, second, you can post mail with the server
on different systems, so you don&rsquo;t need either
MMDF or SendMail on your local host. Big win
in conserving cycles and disk space. Since nmh
supports the notion of a server search&minus;list in this
respect, this approach can be tolerant of faults. Be sure to
set &ldquo;servers:&rdquo; as described in
mh&minus;tailor(8) if you use this option.

There are four
disadvantages to using the SMTP option: First, only UNIX
systems with TCP/IP are supported. Second, you need to have
an SMTP server running somewhere on any network your local
host can reach. Third, this bypasses any authentication
mechanisms in MMDF or SendMail. Fourth, the
file /etc/hosts is used for hostname lookups
(although there is an exception file). In response to these
disadvantages though: First, there&rsquo;s got to be an SMTP
server somewhere around if you&rsquo;re in the Internet or
have a local network. Since the server search&minus;list is
very general, a wide&minus;range of options are possible.
Second, SMTP should be fixed to have authentication
mechanisms in it, like POP. Third, nmh won&rsquo;t
choke on mail to hosts whose official names it can&rsquo;t
verify, it&rsquo;ll just plug along (and besides if you
enable the DUMB configuration options, nmh ignores
the hosts file altogether). ^/etc/nmh/mts.conf~^nmh mts
