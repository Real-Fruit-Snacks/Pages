UATH(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual UATH(4)

NAME

uath &mdash; Atheros USB
IEEE 802.11a/b/g wireless network device

SYNOPSIS

To compile this driver into the
kernel, place the following lines in your kernel
configuration file:

device ehci

device uhci 
device ohci 
device usb 
device uath 
device wlan

Alternatively,
to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following line in loader.conf(5):

if_uath_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION

The uath driver supports
USB 2.0 wireless network devices based on Atheros
Communications fifth generation AR5005UG and AR5005UX
chipsets.

The AR5005UG
chipset is made of an AR5523 multiprotocol MAC/baseband
processor and an AR2112 Radio-on-a-Chip that can operate
between 2300 and 2500 MHz (802.11b/g).

The AR5005UX
chipset is made of an AR5523 multiprotocol MAC/baseband
processor and an AR5112 dual band Radio-on-a-Chip that can
operate between 2300 and 2500 MHz (802.11b/g) or 4900 and
5850 MHz (802.11a).

The AR5005UG and
AR5005UX chipsets both have an integrated 32-bit MIPS
R4000-class processor that runs a firmware and manages,
among other things, the automatic control of the transmit
rate and the calibration of the radio.

uath
supports station, and monitor mode operation.
Only one virtual interface may be configured at any time.
For more information on configuring this device, see
ifconfig(8).

FIRMWARE

uath requires firmware
that is downloaded to the device. This is normally done by
the uathload(8) utility that is launched by devd(8) when the
device is inserted. uathload includes the firmware in the
binary program. This firmware is licensed for general use
and is included in the base system.

HARDWARE

The uath driver should
work with the following adapters:

EXAMPLES

Join an existing BSS network
(i.e., connect to an access point):

ifconfig wlan
create wlandev uath0 inet 192.168.0.20 \ 
netmask 0xffffff00

Join a specific
BSS network with network name
&rsquo;&rsquo;my_net&rsquo;&rsquo;:

ifconfig wlan
create wlandev uath0 ssid my_net up

Join a specific
BSS network with 64-bit WEP encryption:

ifconfig wlan
create wlandev uath0 ssid my_net \

wepmode on wepkey 0x1234567890 weptxkey 1 up

Join a specific
BSS network with 128-bit WEP encryption:

ifconfig wlan
create wlandev uath0 wlanmode adhoc ssid my_net \ 
wepmode on wepkey 0x01020304050607080910111213 weptxkey
1

DIAGNOSTICS

uath%d: could not send
command (error=%s)  An attempt to send a command to
the firmware failed.

uath%d:
timeout waiting for command reply  A read command
was sent to the firmware but the firmware failed to reply in
time.

uath%d:
device timeout  A frame dispatched to the hardware
for transmission did not complete in time. The driver will
reset the hardware. This should not happen.

HISTORY

The uath driver first
appeared in OpenBSD 4.0.

AUTHORS

The uath driver was
written by Weongyo Jeong weongyo [AT] FreeBSD.org>
and Sam Leffler sam [AT] FreeBSD.org>. It is
distantly related to a driver written by Damien Bergamini
damien [AT] openbsd.org>.

CAVEATS

Atheros proprietary 108 Mbps
mode (aka Super AG mode) is not supported.

Dual-band
adapters are presently not working; to workaround,
restriction operation to 2.4GHz channels.
