Differences to lsof/fuser

&bull;

&rsquo;lsof /home/user&rsquo;
and &rsquo;fuser /home/user&rsquo; would not list processes
that have a descriptor open on /home/user/subdir.

&bull;

&rsquo;fuser -m /home/subdir&rsquo; would automatically
go down to the root of a vfsmount (e.g. /home) and list all
processes, instead of limiting to /home/subdir.
