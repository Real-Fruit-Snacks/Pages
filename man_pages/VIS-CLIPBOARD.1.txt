VIS-CLIPBOARD(1)

NAME

vis-clipboard â€”
Read from or write to the system clipboard

SYNOPSIS

vis-clipboard
--usable

vis-clipboard
--copy [--selection selection]

vis-clipboard
--paste [--selection selection]

DESCRIPTION

vis-clipboard wraps
various system-specific tools for interacting with a system
clipboard, like xsel(1) for X11, pbcopy(1) for Mac OS X, and
/dev/clipboard on Cygwin.

vis-clipboard
can run in three different ways, depending on the flag given
on the command-line.

--usable

In this mode,
vis-clipboard looks for a way to interface with the
system clipboard. If it finds one, it terminates with exit
code 0. If no interface to the system clipboard is
available, it terminates with exit code 1.

--copy

In this mode,
vis-clipboard reads the content of standard input,
and stores it in the system clipboard.

--paste

In this mode,
vis-clipboard reads the content of the system
clipboard, and writes it to standard output.

--selection
selection

specify which selection to use,
options are "primary" or "clipboard".
Silently ignored on platforms with a single clipboard.

ENVIRONMENT

The following environment
variables affect the operation of vis-clipboard:

DISPLAY

If non-empty,
vis-clipboard will prefer to access the X11 clipboard
even if other options are available.

EXIT STATUS

The vis-clipboard utility
exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
When run with the --usable flag, an exit status of 0
means that it found a supported system-specific tool, while
1 means that clipboard access is not available.

EXAMPLES

Test whether clipboard access is
available:

if
vis-clipboard --usable; then

echo "Clipboard access available"

else

echo "No clipboard"

fi

Copy a friendly
greeting to the clipboard:

echo
"Hello, World" | vis-clipboard --copy

Send the current
contents of the system clipboard to be recorded and
analyzed:

vis-clipboard
--paste | curl -d - https://www.nsa.gov/
