NAME
       Net::DBus::Binding::PendingCall - A handler for pending method replies

SYNOPSIS
         my $call = Net::DBus::Binding::PendingCall->new(method_call => $call,
                                                         pending_call => $reply);

         # Wait for completion
         $call->block;

         # And get the reply message
         my $msg = $call->get_reply;

DESCRIPTION
       This object is used when it is necessary to make asynchronous method
       calls. It provides the means to be notified when the reply is finally
       received.

METHODS
       my $call = Net::DBus::Binding::PendingCall->new(method_call =>
       $method_call, pending_call => $pending_call);
           Creates a new pending call object, with the "method_call" parameter
           being a reference to the "Net::DBus::Binding::Message::MethodCall"
           object whose reply is being waiting for. The "pending_call"
           parameter is a reference to the raw C pending call object.

       $call->cancel
           Cancel the pending call, causing any reply that is later received
           to be discarded.

       my $boolean = $call->get_completed
           Returns a true value if the pending call has received its reply, or
           a timeout has occurred.

       $call->block
           Block the caller until the reply is received or a timeout occurrs.

       my $msg = $call->get_reply;
           Retrieves the "Net::DBus::Binding::Message" object associated with
           the complete call.

       $call->set_notify($coderef);
           Sets a notification function to be invoked when the pending call
           completes. The callback will be passed a single argument which is
           this pending call object.
