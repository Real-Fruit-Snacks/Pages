NAME

LOAD −
load or reload a shared library file

SYNOPSIS

LOAD
’filename’

DESCRIPTION

This command
loads a shared library file into the PostgreSQL
server’s address space. If the file had been loaded
previously, it is first unloaded. This command is primarily
useful to unload and reload a shared library file that has
been changed since the server first loaded it. To make use
of the shared library, function(s) in it need to be declared
using the CREATE FUNCTION [create_function(7)]
command.

The file name
is specified in the same way as for shared library names in
CREATE FUNCTION [create_function(7)]; in particular,
one may rely on a search path and automatic addition of the
system’s standard shared library file name extension.
See the section called ’’User-Defined
Functions’’ in the documentation for more
information on this topic.

COMPATIBILITY

a PostgreSQL extension.
