DESCRIPTION

"nbdkit-example3-plugin"
is an example nbdkit(1) plugin.

On each
connection, it generates a temporary writable block device
of size "SIZE". The disk is thrown away when the
client disconnects.

The
"size=SIZE" parameter can use a number of common
formats to specify the size, eg. "100M",
"2G". If the parameter is omitted, it defaults to
100M.

Mainly this is
useful for testing nbdkit and as an example for writing
nbdkit plugins (nbdkit-plugin(3)).
