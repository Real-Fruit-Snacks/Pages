LIBBASH(7) libbash Manual LIBBASH(7)

NAME

libbash — A bash
shared libraries package.

DESCRIPTION

libbash is a package that
enables bash dynamic-like shared libraries. Actually its a
tool for managing bash scripts whose functions you may want
to load and use in scripts of your own.

It contains a
’dynamic loader’ for the shared libraries (
ldbash(1)), a configuration tool (ldbashconfig(8)), and some
libraries.

Using ldbash(1)
you are able to load loadable bash libraries, such as
getopts(1) and hashstash(1). A bash shared library that can
be loaded using 
ldbash(1) must answer 4 requirments:

1.

It must be installed in
$LIBBASH_PREFIX/lib/bash (default is
/usr/lib/bash).

2.

It must contain a line that
begins with ’#EXPORT=’. That line will contain
(after the ’=’) a list of functions that the
library exports. I.e. all the function that will be usable
after loading that library will be listed in that line.

3.

It must contain a line that
begins with ’#REQUIRE=’. That line will contain
(after the ’=’) a list of bash libraries that
are required for our library. I.e. every bash library that
is in use in our bash library must be listed there.

4.

The library must be listed (For
more information, see ldbashconfig(8)).

Basic
guidelines for writing library of your own:

1.

Be aware, that your library
will be actually sourced. So, basically, it should contain
(i.e define) only functions.

2.

Try to declare all variables
intended for internal use as local.

3.

Global variables and functions
that are intended for internal use (i.e are not defined in
’#EXPORT=’) should begin with:

___

For example, internal function
myfoosort of hashstash library should be named
as

__hashstash_myfoosort

This helps to avoid conflicts
in global name space when using libraries that come from
different vendors.

4.
