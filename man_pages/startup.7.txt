NAME

startup âˆ’
event signalling system startup

SYNOPSIS

startup
[ENV]...

DESCRIPTION

The
startup event is generated by the Upstart
init(8) daemon after it has completed its own
initialisation and is the signal that the rest of the system
may be started.

Typically this
will involve checking and mounting the partitions and drives
that form the filesystem, loading drivers for connected
devices and starting the X windowing system or other login
environment.

In the default
Upstart configuration, the primary task run on the
startup event is the /etc/init/rc-sysinit.conf
job responsible for generating the System V compatible
runlevel(7) event. See that page for a more detailed
explanation of this process.

Paradoxically
there is currently no corresponding Upstart-native event
signifying that the system is to be shutdown, only the
System V compatible runlevel 0 and runlevel 6
events provide this functionality.

EXAMPLE

A service with
no other dependencies run on startup might use:

start on
startup
