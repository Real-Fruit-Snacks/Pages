NAME

devfs &mdash; device file
system

SYNOPSIS

devfs

devfs rw 0 0

DESCRIPTION

The device file system, or
devfs, provides access to kernel&rsquo;s device
namespace in the global file system namespace. The
conventional mount point is /dev.

The file system
includes several directories, links, symbolic links and
devices, some of which can also be written. In a
chroot&rsquo;ed environment, devfs can be used to
create a new /dev mount point.

The mknod(8)
tool can be used to recover deleted device entries under
devfs.
