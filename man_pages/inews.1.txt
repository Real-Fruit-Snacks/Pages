NAME

inews - send a
Usenet article to the local news server for distribution

SYNOPSIS

inews [
-h ] [ -D ] [ -O ] [ -R ] [
-S ] [ header_flags ] [ input ]

DESCRIPTION

Inews
reads a Usenet news article (perhaps with headers) from the
named file or standard input if no file is given. It adds
some headers and performs some consistency checks. If the
article does not meet these checks (for example, too much
quoting of old articles, or posting to non-existent
newsgroups) then the article is rejected. If it passes the
checks, inews sends the article to the local news
server as specified in the inn.conf(5) file for
distribution.

OPTIONS

-h

In the standard mode of
operation, the input consists of the article headers, a
blank line, and the message body. For compatibility with
older software, the &rsquo;&rsquo;-h&rsquo;&rsquo;
flag must be used. If there are no headers in the message,
then this flag may be omitted.

-O

The default Organization header will be provided if none
is present in the article or if the
&rsquo;&rsquo;-o&rsquo;&rsquo; flag is not used. To
prevent adding the default, use the
&rsquo;&rsquo;-O&rsquo;&rsquo; flag.

-D

As a debugging aide, if the
&rsquo;&rsquo;-D&rsquo;&rsquo; flag is used, the
consistency checks will be performed, and the article will
be sent to the standard output, rather then sent to the
server. 

-A -V -W

For compatibility with C News,
inews accepts, but ignores, the
&rsquo;&rsquo;-A&rsquo;&rsquo;,
&rsquo;&rsquo;-V&rsquo;&rsquo; and
&rsquo;&rsquo;-W&rsquo;&rsquo; flags.

-N

The C News &rsquo;&rsquo;-N&rsquo;&rsquo; flag is
treated as the &rsquo;&rsquo;-D&rsquo;&rsquo;
flag. 

-S

If a file named .signature exists in the
user&rsquo;s home directory, inews will try to append
it to the end of the article. If the file cannot be read, or
if it is too long (for example, more than four lines or one
standard I/O buffer), or if some other problem occurs, then
the article will not be posted. To suppress this action use
the &rsquo;&rsquo;-S&rsquo;&rsquo; flag.

-R

If the &rsquo;&rsquo;-R&rsquo;&rsquo; flag is
used then inews will reject any attempts to post
control messages.

header_flags

Several headers may be
specified on the command line, shown in the synopsis above
as header_flags. Each of these flags takes a single
parameter; if the value is more than one word (for example,
almost all Subject lines) then quotes must be used to
prevent the shell from splitting it into multiple words. The
options, and their equivalent header, are as follows:

a Approved 
c Control 
d Distribution 
e Expires 
f From 
w Followup-To 
n Newsgroups 
r Reply-To 
t Subject 
F References 
o Organization 
x Path prefix

If the
&rsquo;&rsquo;-x&rsquo;&rsquo; flag is used, then its
value will be the start of the header. Any other host will
see the site in the header, and therefore not offer the
article to that site. The Path will always end
not-for-mail.

NOTES

If an
unapproved posting is made to a moderated newsgroup,
inews will try to mail the article to the moderator
for posting. It will query the remote news server for a
moderators listing. If that doesn&rsquo;t succeed, it will
fallback to using the local moderators(5) file to
determine the mailing address. If no address is found, it
will use the inn.conf file to determine a
&rsquo;&rsquo;last-chance&rsquo;&rsquo; host to try.

If the NNTP
server needs to authenticate the client, inews will
use the NNTPsendpassword(3) routine to authenticate
itself. In order to do this, the program will need read
access to the passwd.nntp(5) file. This is typically
done by having the file group-readable and making
inews run setgid to that group.

Inews
exits with a zero status if the article was succesfully
posted or mailed, or with a non-zero status if the article
could not be delivered.

Since
inews will spool its input if the server is
unavailable, it is usually necessary to run rnews(1)
with the &rsquo;&rsquo;-U&rsquo;&rsquo; flag on a regular
basis, usually out of cron(8).
