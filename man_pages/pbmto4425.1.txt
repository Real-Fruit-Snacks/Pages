NAME
       pbmto4425 - Display PBM images on an AT&T 4425 terminal

SYNOPSIS
       pbmto4425 [pbmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       pbmto4425 displays PBM format images on an AT&T 4425 ASCII terminal us‐
       ing that terminal's mosaic graphics character set.  The program  should
       also  work with other VT100-like terminals with mosaic graphics charac‐
       ter sets such as the C. Itoh CIT-101, but it has not yet been tested on
       terminals other than the 4425.

       Pbmto4425 puts the terminal into 132 column mode to achieve the maximum
       resolution of the terminal.  In this mode the terminal has a resolution
       of  264  columns by 69 rows.  The pixels have an aspect ratio of 1:2.6,
       therefore an image should be processed before being displayed in a man‐
       ner such as this:

       % pamscale -xscale 2.6 pamfile \
           | pamscale -xysize 264 69 \
           | ppmtopgm \
           | pamditherbw \
           | pbmto4425

       There  are  no command line options defined specifically for pbmto4425,
