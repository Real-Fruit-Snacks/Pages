NAME

ali - list nmh
mail aliases

SYNOPSIS

ali

[-help] [-version]
[-alias aliasfile] [-list |
-nolist] [-user | -nouser]
[aliases ...]

DESCRIPTION

ali
searches the named mail alias files for each of the given
aliases. It creates a list of addresses for those
aliases, and writes that list on standard output. If
no arguments are given, ali outputs all alias
entries.

By default,
when an alias expands to multiple addresses, the addresses
are separated by commas and printed on as few lines as
possible. If the -list switch is specified, and an
address expands to multiple addresses, each address will
appear on a separate line.

The
-user switch directs ali to perform its
processing in an inverted fashion: instead of listing the
addresses that each given alias expands to, ali will
list the aliases that expand to each given address.

The files
specified by the profile entry
&ldquo;Aliasfile&rdquo; and any additional alias
files given by the -alias aliasfile switch
will be read. Each alias is processed as described in
mh-alias(5).

FILES

Alias files are
looked up in multiple locations: if the pathname is absolute
or starts with &ldquo;.&rdquo; or
&ldquo;..&rdquo; it is accessed directly; otherwise
tilde expansion is done on usernames, then files are
searched for in the user&rsquo;s Mail directory as
specified in their profile. If not found there, the
directory &ldquo;/etc/nmh&rdquo; is checked.

$HOME/.mh_profile

The user&rsquo;s profile.
