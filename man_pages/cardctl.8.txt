NAME

cardctl −
PCMCIA card control utility

SYNOPSIS

cardctl
[-V] command [socket] 
cardctl [−c config] [−f
scheme] [−s stab] scheme
[name]

DESCRIPTION

Cardctl
is used to monitor and control the state of PCMCIA sockets.
If a socket number is specified, the command will be applied
to just one socket; otherwise, all sockets will be
affected.

Cardctl
is also used to select between multiple PCMCIA configuration
schemes. The current scheme name is passed to the device
option scripts as part of the ’’device
address’’, so the scripts can use it to choose
between different setups.

If
cardctl is executed by root, all commands are
available. If it is executed by an unpriviledged user, only
the informational commands are accessible.

Some commands
may not work or give misleading results if cardmgr is
not running.

COMMANDS

status

Display the current socket
status flags.

config

Display the socket
configuration, including power settings, interrupt and I/O
window settings, and configuration registers.

ident

Display card identification
information, including product identification strings,
manufacturer ID codes, and function ID codes.

info

Much like the ident
command, but its output is formatted as a series of
Bourne-stype shell variable definitions for use in
scripts.

suspend

Shut down and then disable
power for a socket.

resume

Restore power to a socket, and
re-configure for use.

reset

Send a reset signal to a
socket, subject to approval by any drivers already bound to
the socket.

eject

Notify all client drivers that
this card will be ejected, then cut power to the socket.

insert

Notify all client drivers that
this card has just been inserted.

scheme

If no scheme name is given,
cardctl will display the current PCMCIA configuration
scheme. If a scheme name is given, cardctl will
unconfigure all PCMCIA devices, and reconfigure for the new
scheme.

OPTIONS

−V

Show version information and
exit. 

−c
config

Look for the card configuration
database and card configuration scripts in the specified
directory, instead of /etc/pcmcia.

−f
scheme

Use the specified file to keep
track of the current configuration scheme, instead of
/var/lib/misc/scheme. (If a /var/lib/pcmcia
directory exists, /var/lib/pcmcia/scheme is used
instead.)

−s stab

Read current socket information
from the specified file, instead of
/var/run/stab.
