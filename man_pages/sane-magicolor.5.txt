NAME

sane-magicolor
- SANE backend for KONICA MINOLTA magicolor scanners

DESCRIPTION

The
sane-magicolor backend supports KONICA MINOLTA
magicolor scanners connected via USB or LAN. Currently, only
the magicolor 1690MF device is supported, no other devices
with the same scanning protocol are known.

SUPPORTED DEVICES

The following
scanner should work with this backend:

Device Details

----------------------------- 
Vendor: KONICA MINOLTA 
Model: magicolor 1690MF

CONFIGURATION

This section
describes the backend&rsquo;s configuration file entries.
The file is located at:

/etc/sane.d/magicolor.conf

For a proper
setup, at least one of the following entries are needed:

net
autodiscovery 
net [IP ADDRESS] [DEVICE-ID] 
usb 
usb [VENDOR-ID] [DEVICE-ID]

FILES

/etc/sane.d/magicolor.conf

The backend configuration
file

/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-magicolor.a

The static library implementing
this backend.

/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-magicolor.so

The shared library implementing
this backend (present on systems that support dynamic
loading).

ENVIRONMENT

SANE_CONFIG_DIR

This environment variable
specifies the list of directories that may contain the
configuration file. Under UNIX, the directories are
separated by a colon (&rsquo;:&rsquo;), under OS/2, they are
separated by a semi-colon (&rsquo;;&rsquo;). If this
variable is not set, the configuration file is searched in
two default directories: first, the current working
directory (".") and then in /etc/sane.d. If the
value of the environment variable ends with the directory
separator character, then the default directories are
searched after the explicitly specified directories. For
example, setting SANE_CONFIG_DIR to
"/tmp/config:" would result in directories
"/tmp/config", ".", and
"/etc/sane.d" being searched (in this order).

SANE_DEBUG_MAGICOLOR

If the library was compiled
with debug support enabled, this environment variable
controls the debug level for this backend. Higher debug
levels increase the verbosity of the output.

Example: export
SANE_DEBUG_MAGICOLOR=127

To obtain debug
messages from the backend, set this environment variable
before calling your favorite frontend (e.g. xscanimage).

Example:
SANE_DEBUG_MAGICOLOR=65 xscanimage

KNOWN BUGS AND RESTRICTIONS

Large color
scans may sometimes timeout due to unknown reasons (the
scanner simply stops returning data)

Cancelling
large scans may lock up the scanner.
