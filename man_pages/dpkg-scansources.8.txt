NAME

dpkg-scansources
&minus; prog

SYNOPSIS

dpkg-scansources
[switch]... binary-dir [override-file
[path-prefix]] > Sources

DESCRIPTION

dpkg-scansources
scans the given binary-dir for .dsc files.
These are used to create a Debian source index, which is
output to stdout.

The
override-file, if given, is used to set priorities in
the resulting index records and to override the maintainer
field given in the .dsc files. See the
dpkg-scanpackages manpage for the format of this
file. NB: Since the override file is indexed by binary, not
source, packages, there&rsquo;s a bit of a problem here. The
current implementation uses the highest priority of all the
binary packages produced by a .dsc file for the
priority of the source package, and the override entry for
the first binary package listed in the .dsc file to
modify maintainer information. This might change.

The
path-prefix, if given, is prepended to the directory
field in the generated source index. You generally use this
to make the directory fields contain the path from the top
of the Debian archive hierarchy.

OPTIONS

--debug

Turn debugging on.

--help

Show the usage message and
die.

&minus;n,
--no-sort

Don&rsquo;t sort the index
records. Normally they are sorted by source package
name.

&minus;s,
--source-override file

Use file as the source
override file. The default is the name of the override file
you specified with .src appended.

The source
override file is in a different format from the binary
override file. It contains only two whitespace separated
fields, the first is the source package name and the second
is the section. Blank lines and comment lines are ignored in
the normal manner. If a package appears in both files the
source override takes precedence for setting the
section.

--version

Print the version number and
exit.
