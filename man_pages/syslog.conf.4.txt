NAME

syslog.conf
− configuration file for syslogd system log daemon

SYNOPSIS

/etc/syslog.conf

DESCRIPTION

The file
/etc/syslog.conf contains information used by the
system log daemon, syslogd(1M), to forward a system
message to appropriate log files and/or users.
syslogd preprocesses this file through m4(1)
to obtain the correct information for certain log files,
defining LOGHOST if the address of
"loghost" is the same as one of the addresses of
the host that is running syslogd.

A configuration
entry is composed of two TAB-separated fields:

selector
action

The
selector field contains a semicolon-separated list of
priority specifications of the form:

facility.level
[ ; facility.level ]

where
facility is a system facility, or comma-separated
list of facilities, and level is an indication of the
severity of the condition being logged. Recognized values
for facility include:

user

Messages generated by user processes. This is the
default priority for messages from programs or facilities
not listed in this file.

kern

Messages generated by the kernel.

mail

The mail system.

daemon

System daemons, such as
in.ftpd(1M)

auth

The authorization system: login(1),
su(1M), getty(1M), among others.

lpr

The line printer spooling system: lpr(1B),
lpc(1B), among others.

news

Reserved for the USENET network news system.

uucp

Reserved for the UUCP system; it does not currently use
the syslog mechanism.

cron

The cron/at facility; crontab(1),
at(1), cron(1M), among others.

local0-7

Reserved for local use.

mark

For timestamp messages produced internally by
syslogd. 

*

An asterisk indicates all facilities except for the
mark facility.

Recognized
values for level are (in descending order of
severity):

emerg

For panic conditions that would
normally be broadcast to all users.

alert

For conditions that should be corrected immediately,
such as a corrupted system database.

crit

For warnings about critical conditions, such as hard
device errors.

err

For other errors.

warning

For warning messages.

notice

For conditions that are not
error conditions, but may require special handling. A
configuration entry with a level value of
notice must appear on a separate line.

info

Informational messages.

debug

For messages that are normally used only when debugging
a program.

none

Do not send messages from the indicated facility
to the selected file. For example, a selector of

*.debug;mail.none

will send all
messages except mail messages to the selected
file.

The
action field indicates where to forward the message.
Values for this field can have one of four forms:

•

A filename, beginning with a
leading slash, which indicates that messages specified by
the selector are to be written to the specified file.
The file will be opened in append mode if it exists. If the
file does not exist, logging will silently fail for this
action. 

•

The name of a remote host, prefixed with an @, as
with: @server, which indicates that messages
specified by the selector are to be forwarded to the
syslogd on the named host. The hostname
"loghost" is the hostname given to the machine
that will log syslogd messages. Every machine is
"loghost" by default. See hosts(4). It is
also possible to specify one machine on a network to be
"loghost" by making the appropriate host table
entries. If the local machine is designated to be
"loghost", then syslogd messages are
written to the appropriate files. Otherwise, they are sent
to the machine "loghost" on the network.

•

A comma-separated list of usernames, which indicates
that messages specified by the selector are to be
written to the named users if they are logged in.

•

An asterisk, which indicates that messages specified by
the selector are to be written to all logged-in
users. 

Blank lines are
ignored. Lines for which the first nonwhite character is a
’#’ are treated as comments.

EXAMPLES

Example 1: A
Sample Configuration File

With the
following configuration file:

syslogd(1M)
will log all mail system messages except debug
messages and all notice (or higher) messages into a
file named /var/log/notice. It logs all critical
messages into /var/log/critical, and all kernel
messages and 20-minute marks onto the system console.

Kernel messages
of err (error) severity or higher are forwarded to
the machine named server. Emergency messages are
forwarded to all users. The users root and
operator are informed of any alert messages.
All messages from the authorization system of warning
level or higher are logged in the file
/var/log/auth.

FILES

/var/log/notice

log of all mail system messages
(except debug messages) and all messages of
notice level or higher

/var/log/critical

log of all critical
messages

/var/log/auth

log of all messages from the
authorization system of warning level or higher
