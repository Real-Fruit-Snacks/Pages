NAME
       yuvsplittoppm - convert separate Y, U, and V files into a PPM image

SYNOPSIS
       yuvsplittoppm

       basename width height [-ccir601]

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       yuvsplittoppm  reads three files, containing the YUV components, as in‐
       put.  These files are basename.Y, basename.U, and basename.V.  Produces
       a PPM image on Standard Output.

       Since the YUV files are raw files, the dimensions width and height must
       be specified on the command line.

OPTIONS
       In addition to the options common to all programs  based  on  libnetpbm
       (most notably -quiet, see
        Common  Options ⟨index.html#commonoptions⟩ ), yuvsplittoppm recognizes
       the following command line option:

       -ccir601
              Assumes that the YUV triplets are scaled into the smaller  range
              of  the CCIR 601 (MPEG) standard. Else, the JFIF (JPEG) standard
              is assumed.
