NAME

stab &minus;
current PCMCIA socket status

DESCRIPTION

The stab
file is created by cardmgr and contains
identification and device driver information for PCMCIA
cards. Each socket is described by one header line, followed
by one or more device descriptions. The header gives the
card name as given in /etc/pcmcia/config. Device
lines consist of a series of tab-separated fields. For each
device, the fields correspond to socket number, device
class, driver name, instance, device name, and major and
minor numbers. The device class identifies which script in
/etc/pcmcia is used to configure or shut down this
device. The instance is used to number devices when a single
card has several devices associated with the same driver.
The device name may either a filename in /dev or be a
network interface name. The major and minor numbers are only
present if appropriate for this device type.

The file is
updated by cardmgr whenever a card is inserted or
ejected, and when cardmgr receives a SIGHUP
signal.

The stab
file will normally be created in /var/lib/pcmcia, but
if that directory is unavailable, it will be found in
/var/run.
