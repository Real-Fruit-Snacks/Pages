NAME

nbdkit-nocache-filter
- nbdkit nocache filter

SYNOPSIS

nbdkit
--filter=nocache plugin [cachemode=MODE]
[plugin-args...]

DESCRIPTION

"nbdkit-nocache-filter"
is a filter that intentionally disables efficient handling
of advisory client cache requests across the NBD protocol.
It is mainly useful for evaluating timing differences to
determine the impact of caching requests.

Note that the
effects of this filter (in crippling handling of client
cache requests) is somewhat orthogonal from that of the
nbdkit-cache-filter(1) (adding local caching of
client read/write requests); the two filters can be run
together to experiment with timings.

PARAMETERS

cachemode=none

cachemode=emulate 
cachemode=nop

Optional, controls which mode
the filter will use. Mode none (default) means that
cache support is not advertised to the client. Mode
emulate means that cache support is emulated by the
filter using the plugin&rsquo;s "pread" callback,
regardless of whether the plugin itself implemented the
"cache" callback. Mode nop means that cache
requests are always accepted and immediately ignored, rather
than having any actual impact.

EXAMPLES

Serve the file
disk.img, but prevent "NBD_CMD_CACHE"
requests altogether, to get a baseline timing of behavior
when the client is unable to make cache requests:

nbdkit
--filter=nocache file disk.img

Serve the file
disk.img, but with cache requests silently ignored,
rather than being forwarded on to the file plugin (which
attempts to use posix_fadvise(3)), to compare against
the timings without the filter and determine whether the
file plugin caching was worthwhile:

nbdkit
--filter=nocache file disk.img cachemode=nop

FILES

$filterdir/nbdkit-nocache-filter.so

The filter.

Use
"nbdkit --dump-config" to find the location of
$filterdir.

VERSION

"nbdkit-nocache-filter"
first appeared in nbdkit 1.14.
