NAME

pmlogconf
- create/edit a pmlogger configuration file

SYNOPSIS

pmlogconf
[-cqrvV?] [-d groupsdir] [-g
grouptag] [-h host] [-s
groupfile] configfile

DESCRIPTION

pmlogconf
may be used to create and modify a generic configuration
file for the PCP archiver, pmlogger(1).

If
configfile does not exist, pmlogconf will
create a generic configuration file with a default set of
enabled metrics and logging intervals.

Once created,
configfile may be used with the -c option to
pmlogger(1) to select performance metrics and specify
logging intervals for a PCP archive.

If
configfile does exist, pmlogconf will prompt
for input from the user to enable or disable groups of
related performance metrics and to control the logging
interval for each enabled group.

Group selection
requires a simple y (yes) or n (no) response
to the prompt Log this group?.

Other responses
at this point may be used to select additional control
functions as follows:

m

Report the names of the metrics in the current
group. 

q

Finish with group selection (quit) and make no further
changes to this group or any subsequent group.

/pattern

Make no change to this group but search for a group
containing pattern in the description of the group or
the names of the associated metrics.

A logging
interval is specified by responding to the Logging
interval? prompt with the keywords once or
default or a valid pmlogger(1) interval
specification of the form &rsquo;&rsquo;every N
timeunits&rsquo;&rsquo; or simply &rsquo;&rsquo;N
timeunits &rsquo;&rsquo; (the every is optional)
where N is an unsigned integer and timeunits
is one of the keywords msec, millisecond,
sec, second, min, minute,
hour or the plural form of one of the keywords.

When run from
automated logging setup processes, the -c option is
used to indicate that pmlogconf is in auto-create
mode and no interactive dialog takes place. The output
configfile has an additional comment message and
timestamp indicating this fact, so that it can be identified
and subsequently updated using -c again. This option
is not appropriate for interactive use of the tool.

The -q
option suppresses the logging interval dialog and preserves
the current interval from configfile.

More verbose
output may be enabled with the -v option.

SETUP GROUP FILES

When an initial
configfile is created, the default specifications
come from a set of group files below the groupsdir
specified with the -d option (the default
groupsdir is $PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmlogconf
which is most commonly correct, so the -d option is
rarely used in practice).

The directory
structure below groupsdir is arbitrary as all regular
files will be found by recursive descent and considered, so
add-on products and PMDA developers can easily extend the
available defaults to pmlogconf by adding new
directories and/or group files below groupsdir.

These group
files are processed in the following ways:

&bull;

When a new configfile is
created, all group files are processed.

&bull;

Whenever pmlogconf is run with an existing
configfile, groupsdir is traversed to see if
any new groups have been defined and should be considered
for inclusion in configfile.

&bull;

When pmlogconf processes a group in
configfile that is enabled, the list of metrics
associated with the group is taken from the group file (and
replaces any previous list of metrics associated with this
group in configfile).

&bull;

When either the -r (reprobe) or the -c
(auto-create) command line option is specified, every group
(not just newly discovered ones) is reprocessed to see if it
should be considered for inclusion in configfile.

&bull;

If a group is found in configfile but the
corresponding group does not exist below groupsdir
(as would be the case when a group is made obsolete by a PCP
upgrade) then the handling of the group depends on the mode
in which pmlogconf is being run. With -c the
corresponding group is culled from configfile,
otherwise the corresponding group is unchanged in
configfile. In either case a warning is issued.

Each group file
is structured as follows:

&bull;

The first line must contain
#pmlogconf-setup 2.0

&bull;

Other lines beginning with # are treated as
comments. 

&bull;

Blank lines are ignored.

&bull;

One or more lines starting with the keyword ident
are used to provide the human-readable description of the
group. 

&bull;

Non-blank lines beginning with white space define
metrics to be associated with this group, one per line. Each
metric specification follows the rules for a
pmlogger(1) configuration, namely either the name of
a non-leaf node in the PMNS (implying all descendent names
in the PMNS), or the name of a leaf node in the PMNS
optionally followed by one or more instance names enclosed
by &rsquo;&rsquo;[&rsquo;&rsquo; and
&rsquo;&rsquo;]&rsquo;&rsquo;. 

&bull;

A control line starting with one of the keywords
probe or force must be present.

&bull;

An optional logging interval control line begins with
the keyword delta followed by one of the
pmlogger(1) interval specification described
above. 

&bull;

probe control lines have the format:

probe metric
[condition [state_rule] ]

where metric is the name of a PCP metric (must be
a leaf node in the PMNS, no instance specification is
allowed, and it must not be a derived metric) and the
optional condition is the keyword exists (true
if metric exists, i.e. is defined in the PMNS) or the
keyword values (true if metric exists in the
PMNS and has one or more current values) or an expression of
the form

op val where op is one of
the awk(1) operators (==, !=,
>, >=, , ,
~ (regular expression match) or !~ (negated
regular expression match)) and val is a value
(arbitrary sequence of characters, excluding a space) and
the condition is true if there is some instance of
metric that makes the expression true.

If the condition is
missing, the default is exists.

When an explicit
condition is provided, there may also be an optional
state_rule of the form

? true_state :
false_state where true_state (applies if
condition is true) and false_state (applies if
condition is false) are both taken from the keywords
include (include and enable the group and the
associated metrics in configfile), available
(include and disable the group in configfile - a user
action of y as described above is needed to enable
the group and add the associated metrics into
configfile) or exclude (the group is not
considered for inclusion in configfile).

The default state_rule
is

? available : exclude

&bull;

force control lines begin
with the keyword force followed by one of the states
defined above, so one of the actions include,
exclude or available is applied
unconditionally to the group.

Probing is only
done when a new group is being added to configfile or
when the -r command line option is specified. The
evaluation of the probing conditions is done by contacting
pmcd(1) on hostname (defaults to local:).

OPTIONS

The available
command line options are:

-c

Enable non-interactive,
auto-create mode.

-d groupdir,
--groups=groupdir

Specify the path to the
groupsdir directory.

-g grouptag,
--group=grouptag

Query logging state for the
specific logging group named grouptag.

-h host,
--host=host

Performance metrics source is
pmcd(1) on host, rather than on the default
localhost.

-q, --quiet

Quiet mode, suppress logging
interval dialog.

-r, --reprobe

Reconsider every group for
inclusion in the configfile.

-s groupfile,
--setup=groupfile

Report the default logging
state for the one logging group in groupfile. This is
equivalent output to that produced by the retired
pmlogconf-setup shell script from earlier versions of
PCP.

-v, --verbose

Enable verbose mode.

-V, --version

Display version number and
exit.

-?, --help

Display usage message and
exit.

EXAMPLE

The following
group file demonstrates all of the supported syntactic
elements.

#pmlogconf-setup
2.0 
ident Example group file 
ident ... more description 
delta 1 minute 
probe sample.secret.foo.one values ? include : exclude 
sample.secret.foo.one 
sample.secret.foo.bar # non-leaf in the PMNS 
sample.colour [ red green ]

MIGRATION

The current
version of pmlogconf (2.0) supports a slightly
different format for configfile compared to earlier
versions. If an old version configfile is presented
to pmlogconf it will be converted to the new
format.

PCP ENVIRONMENT

Environment
variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On
each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains
the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).

pmlogconf
overrides any $PCP_DERIVED_CONFIG environment
variable to an empty string, for performance reasons.

pmlogconf
honours the $PMCD_WAIT_TIMEOUT environment variable
when probing and creating new pmlogger configuration
files. It uses a default timeout value of 10 seconds for
this, in the absence of an environment setting.
