EST(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual EST(4)

NAME

est â€” Enhanced
Speedstep Technology

SYNOPSIS

To compile this capability into
your kernel place the following line in your kernel
configuration file:

device
cpufreq

DESCRIPTION

The est interface
provides support for the Intel Enhanced Speedstep
Technology.

Note that
est capabilities are automatically loaded by the
cpufreq(4) driver.

LOADER TUNABLES

The est interface is
intended to allow cpufreq(4) to access and implement Intel
Enhanced SpeedStep Technology via acpi(4) and the acpi_perf
interface accessors. If the default settings are not
optimal, the following sysctls can be used to modify or
monitor est behavior.

hw.est.msr_info

Attempt to infer information
from direct probing of the msr. Should only be used in
diagnostic cases. (default 0)

hw.est.strict

Validate frequency requested is
accepted by the cpu when set. It appears that this will only
work on single core cpus. (default 0)

SYSCTL VARIABLES

The following sysctl(8) values
are available

dev.est.%d.desc

Description of support, almost
always Enhanced SpeedStep Frequency Control.

dev.est.0.%desc: Enhanced
SpeedStep Frequency Control

dev.est.%d.driver

Driver in use, always est.

dev.est.0.%driver: est

dev.est.%d.parent

dev.est.0.%parent: cpu0

The cpu that is exposing these
frequencies. For example cpu0.

dev.est.%d.freq_settings.

The valid frequencies that are
allowed by this CPU and their step values.

dev.est.0.freq_settings:
2201/45000 2200/45000 2000/39581 1900/37387

1800/34806 1700/32703
1600/30227 1500/28212 1400/25828 1300/23900 1200/21613
1100/19775 1000/17582 900/15437 800/13723

DIAGNOSTICS

est%d:  on cpu%d 

Indicates normal
startup of this interface.

est: CPU
supports Enhanced Speedstep, but is not recognized. 

est: cpu_vendor GenuineIntel, msr 471c471c0600471c 

device_attach: est%d attach returned 6 

Indicates all
attempts to attach to this interface have failed. This
usually indicates an improper BIOS setting restricting O/S
control of the CPU speeds. Consult your BIOS documentation
for more details.

COMPATIBILITY

est is only found on
supported Intel CPUs.
