NAME

dpt-import-orig
- "gbp import-orig" wrapper with upstream tracking
support

SYNOPSIS

dpt
import-orig [../package_version.orig.tar.gz]

DESCRIPTION

dpt
import-orig is a wrapper around gbp import-orig
using its --uscan and --upstream-vcs-tag
options to fetch and import tarballs and link to upstream
Git tags.

If necessary,
the git remote is added using
dpt-upstream-repo(1).

If a parameter
is passed, it&rsquo;s taken as orig tar-ball to import
instead of using uscan to download the tar ball. Needed if a
newer upstream release has a (from dpkg&rsquo;s point of
view) lower version number and gbp bails out over uscan not
having downloaded a tar ball.

CONFIGURATION

dpt
import-orig reads the "DPT_RM_TARGZ"
environment variable to determine if the downloaded
.orig.tar.gz should be removed after the import.

See
dpt-config(5) for details.
