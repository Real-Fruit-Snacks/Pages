VPO(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual VPO(4)

NAME

vpo &mdash; parallel to
SCSI interface driver

SYNOPSIS

device vpo

For one or more
SCSI busses:

device scbus

DESCRIPTION

The vpo driver provide
access to parallel port Iomega Zip and Jaz drives.

HARDWARE

The vpo driver supports
the following parallel to SCSI interfaces:

&bull;

Adaptec AIC-7110 Parallel to
SCSI interface (built-in to Iomega ZIP drives)

&bull;

Iomega Jaz Traveller
interface

&bull;

Iomega MatchMaker SCSI
interface (built-in to Iomega ZIP+ drives)

USAGE

The driver should let you use a
printer connected to the drive while transferring data.

DOS and FreeBSD
file systems are supported. When mounting a DOS file system
or formatting a FreeBSD file system, check the slice of the
disk with the gpart(8) utility.

In order to
unixify a ZIP disk, put the following in /etc/disktab:

zip|zip 100:\

:ty=removable:se#512:nc#96:nt#64:ns#32:\ 
:pa#196608:oa#0:ba#4096:fa#512:\ 
:pb#196608:ob#0:bb#4096:fb#512:\ 
:pc#196608:oc#0:bc#4096:fc#512:

and use
bsdlabel(8).

If you have
trouble with your driver, your parallel chipset may not run
properly at the detected mode (NIBBLE, PS2 or EPP). Tune the
ppc(4) bootflags to force other modes.

BUGS

During boot, the driver first
tries to detect a classic ZIP, then a ZIP+. The ZIP+
detection is intrusive and may send erroneous characters to
your printer if the drive is not connected to your parallel
port.
