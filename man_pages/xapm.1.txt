NAME

xapm &minus;
display Advanced Power Management (APM) BIOS information

SYNOPSIS

xapm [ ...
]

DESCRIPTION

xapm
puts up an X window that displays the remaining battery
life. The left side of the window contains a printed time or
percentage; the right side of the window contains a bar
indicating the percentage. Clicking on the left side of the
window will toggle the display between time and
percentage.

OPTIONS AND RESOURCES

In addition to
standard Xt options, the following options are
available:

&minus;V

Print the program version number and exit.

&minus;highcolor
color

The color of the bar when the
battery percentage is above highvalue. Defaults to
"green". (*highColor)

&minus;lowcolor
color

The color of the bar when the
battery percentage is between lowvalue and
highvalue. Defaults to "yellow".
(*lowColor)

&minus;criticalcolor
color

The color of the bar when the
battery percentage is below lowvalue. Defaults to
"red". This color is also used to flash the
alphanumeric part of the display when the power status is
critical. (*criticalCOlor)

&minus;highvalue
highvalue

Set highvalue. The
default is 50. (*highValue)

&minus;lowvalue
lowvalue

Set lowvalue. The
default is 10. (*lowValue)

&minus;chargingcolor
color

The color of the printed
display when charging. The default is "blue". Use
&minus;foreground to change the color used when on
battery power. (*chargingColor)

&minus;delay
delay

Sets the number of seconds
delay between each update. The default is 1. (*delay)

&minus;percent

Display percentage on startup,
instead of time remaining. (*percent, boolean)

&minus;percentauto

Swap automatically between
displaying percentage and displaying the time remaining.
When on ac power, display percentage, when on battery power,
display the time remaining.

BUGS

There is no way
to inhibit the alphanumeric display or the bar display. When
the battery percentage is low, using a bright color to warn
you of impending doom may be futile because the bar is too
short. Because of the form widget&rsquo;s desire to maintain
proportions, dynamic resizing of the window may not do what
you want it to do.
