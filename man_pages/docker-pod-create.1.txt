NAME
       podman-pod-create - Create a new pod

SYNOPSIS
       podman pod create [options] [name]

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an  empty pod, or unit of multiple containers, and prepares it
       to have containers added to it. The pod can be created with a  specific
       name.  If a name is not given a random name is generated. The pod id is
       printed  to  STDOUT.   You   can   then   use   podman   create   --pod
       <pod_id|pod_name>  ...  to  add  containers  to the pod, and podman pod
       start <pod_id|pod_name> to start the pod.

       The operator can identify a pod in three  ways:  UUID  long  identifier
       (“f78375b1c487e03c9438c729345e54db9d20cfa2ac1fc3494b6eb60872e74778”)
       UUID short identifier (“f78375b1c487”) Name (“jonah”)

       podman generates a UUID for each pod, and if a name is not assigned  to
       the  container  with --name then a random string name will be generated
       for it. The name is useful any place you need to identify a pod.

       Note: resource limit related flags work by setting the  limits  explic‐
       itly in the pod's cgroup which by default, is the cgroup parent for all
       containers joining the pod. Containers are still delegated the  ability
       to set their own resource limits when joining a pod meaning that if you
       run podman pod create --cpus=5 you can also run podman container create
       --pod=<pod_id|pod_name>  --cpus=4  and  the container will only see the
       smaller limit. containers do NOT get the pod level cgroup resources  if
       they   specify   their   own   cgroup   when  joining  a  pod  such  as
       --cgroupns=host

OPTIONS
   --add-host=host:ip
       Add a custom host-to-IP mapping (host:ip)

       Add a line to /etc/hosts. The format is hostname:ip. The --add-host op‐
       tion can be set multiple times. Conflicts with the --no-hosts option.

       The /etc/hosts file is shared between all containers in the pod.

   --blkio-weight=weight
       Block IO relative weight. The weight is a value between 10 and 1000.

       This option is not supported on cgroups V1 rootless systems.

   --blkio-weight-device=device:weight
       Block IO relative device weight.

   --cgroup-parent=path
       Path  to cgroups under which the cgroup for the pod will be created. If
       the path is not absolute, the path is considered to be relative to  the
       cgroups  path  of  the init process. Cgroups will be created if they do
       not already exist.

   --cpu-shares, -c=shares
       CPU shares (relative weight).

       By default, all containers get the same proportion of CPU cycles.  This
       proportion  can  be  modified  by  changing  the  container's CPU share
       weighting relative to the combined weight of all the  running  contain‐
       ers.  Default weight is 1024.

       The  proportion  will  only apply when CPU-intensive processes are run‐
       ning.  When tasks in one container are idle, other containers  can  use
       the left-over CPU time. The actual amount of CPU time will vary depend‐
       ing on the number of containers running on the system.

       For example, consider three containers, one has a cpu-share of 1024 and
       two others have a cpu-share setting of 512. When processes in all three
       containers attempt to use 100% of CPU, the first  container  would  re‐
       ceive  50% of the total CPU time. If a fourth container is added with a
       cpu-share of 1024, the first container only gets 33% of  the  CPU.  The
       remaining containers receive 16.5%, 16.5% and 33% of the CPU.

       On a multi-core system, the shares of CPU time are distributed over all
       CPU cores. Even if a container is limited to  less  than  100%  of  CPU
       time, it can use 100% of each individual CPU core.

       For example, consider a system with more than three cores.  If the con‐
       tainer C0 is started with --cpu-shares=512 running one process, and an‐
       other  container  C1 with --cpu-shares=1024 running two processes, this
       can result in the following division of CPU shares:

       ┌────┬───────────┬─────┬──────────────┐
       │PID │ container │ CPU │ CPU share    │
       ├────┼───────────┼─────┼──────────────┤
       │100 │ C0        │ 0   │ 100% of CPU0 │
       ├────┼───────────┼─────┼──────────────┤
       │101 │ C1        │ 1   │ 100% of CPU1 │
       ├────┼───────────┼─────┼──────────────┤
       │102 │ C1        │ 2   │ 100% of CPU2 │
       └────┴───────────┴─────┴──────────────┘

       On some systems, changing the resource limits may not  be  allowed  for
       non-root  users.  For  more  details,  see  https://github.com/contain‐
       ers/podman/blob/main/troubleshooting.md#26-running-containers-with-re‐
       source-limits-fails-with-a-permissions-error

       This option is not supported on cgroups V1 rootless systems.

   --cpus=amount
       Set  the  total  number  of CPUs delegated to the pod. Default is 0.000
       which indicates that there is no limit on computation power.

   --cpuset-cpus=number
       CPUs in which to allow execution. Can be specified as a comma-separated
       list  (e.g.  0,1),  as  a  range (e.g. 0-3), or any combination thereof
       (e.g. 0-3,7,11-15).

       On some systems, changing the resource limits may not  be  allowed  for
       non-root  users.  For  more  details,  see  https://github.com/contain‐
       ers/podman/blob/main/troubleshooting.md#26-running-containers-with-re‐
       source-limits-fails-with-a-permissions-error

       This option is not supported on cgroups V1 rootless systems.

   --cpuset-mems=nodes
       Memory nodes (MEMs) in which to allow execution (0-3, 0,1). Only effec‐
       tive on NUMA systems.

       If there are four memory nodes  on  the  system  (0-3),  use  --cpuset-
       mems=0,1  then processes in the container will only use memory from the
       first two memory nodes.

       On some systems, changing the resource limits may not  be  allowed  for
       non-root  users.  For  more  details,  see  https://github.com/contain‐
       ers/podman/blob/main/troubleshooting.md#26-running-containers-with-re‐
       source-limits-fails-with-a-permissions-error

       This option is not supported on cgroups V1 rootless systems.

   --device=host-device[:container-device][:permissions]
       Add  a  host  device  to the pod. Optional permissions parameter can be
       used to specify device permissions by  combining  r  for  read,  w  for
       write, and m for mknod(2).

       Example: --device=/dev/sdc:/dev/xvdc:rwm.

       Note: if host-device is a symbolic link then it will be resolved first.
       The pod will only store the major and minor numbers of the host device.

       Podman may load kernel modules required for using the specified device.
       The  devices  that  Podman  will  load  modules for when necessary are:
       /dev/fuse.

       In rootless mode, the new device is bind mounted in the container  from
       the host rather than Podman creating it within the container space. Be‐
       cause the bind mount retains its SELinux label on SELinux systems,  the
       container  can get permission denied when accessing the mounted device.
       Modify SELinux settings to allow containers to use  all  device  labels
       via the following command:

       $ sudo setsebool -P  container_use_devices=true

       Note:  the  pod implements devices by storing the initial configuration
       passed by the user and recreating the device on each container added to
       the pod.

   --device-read-bps=path:rate
       Limit  read  rate  (in  bytes per second) from a device (e.g. --device-
       read-bps=/dev/sda:1mb).

       On some systems, changing the resource limits may not  be  allowed  for
       non-root  users.  For  more  details,  see  https://github.com/contain‐
       ers/podman/blob/main/troubleshooting.md#26-running-containers-with-re‐
       source-limits-fails-with-a-permissions-error

       This option is not supported on cgroups V1 rootless systems.

   --device-write-bps=path:rate
       Limit  write  rate  (in  bytes  per second) to a device (e.g. --device-
       write-bps=/dev/sda:1mb).

       On some systems, changing the resource limits may not  be  allowed  for
       non-root  users.  For  more  details,  see  https://github.com/contain‐
       ers/podman/blob/main/troubleshooting.md#26-running-containers-with-re‐
       source-limits-fails-with-a-permissions-error

       This option is not supported on cgroups V1 rootless systems.

   --dns=ipaddr
       Set custom DNS servers in the /etc/resolv.conf file that will be shared
       between all containers in the pod. A special option, "none" is  allowed
       which disables creation of /etc/resolv.conf for the pod.

   --dns-option=option
       Set custom DNS options in the /etc/resolv.conf file that will be shared
       between all containers in the pod.

   --dns-search=domain
       Set custom DNS search domains in the /etc/resolv.conf file that will be
       shared between all containers in the pod.

   --exit-policy=continue | stop
       Set  the  exit  policy  of the pod when the last container exits.  Sup‐
       ported policies are:

       ┌────────────┬────────────────────────────┐
       │Exit Policy │ Description                │
       ├────────────┼────────────────────────────┤
       │continue    │ The pod continues running, │
       │            │ by  keeping its infra con‐ │
       │            │ tainer  alive,  when   the │
       │            │ last container exits. Used │
       │            │ by default.                │
       ├────────────┼────────────────────────────┤
       │stop        │ The pod (including its in‐ │
       │            │ fra  container) is stopped │
       │            │ when  the  last  container │
       │            │ exits. Used in kube play.  │
       └────────────┴────────────────────────────┘

   --gidmap=pod_gid:host_gid:amount
       GID map for the user namespace. Using this flag will run all containers
       in the pod with user namespace enabled.  It conflicts with the --userns
       and --subgidname flags.

   --help, -h
       Print usage statement.

   --hostname=name
       Set a hostname to the pod.

   --infra
       Create  an infra container and associate it with the pod. An infra con‐
       tainer is a lightweight container used to coordinate the shared  kernel
       namespace of a pod. Default: true.

   --infra-command=command
       The  command  that  will  be run to start the infra container. Default:
       "/pause".

   --infra-conmon-pidfile=file
       Write the pid of the infra container's conmon process  to  a  file.  As
       conmon  runs  in a separate process than Podman, this is necessary when
       using systemd to manage Podman containers and pods.

   --infra-image=image
       The custom image that will be used for  the  infra  container.   Unless
       specified,  Podman  builds  a custom local image which does not require
       pulling down an image.

   --infra-name=name
       The name that will be used for the pod's infra container.

   --ip=ipv4
       Specify a static IPv4 address for the pod,  for  example  10.88.64.128.
       This option can only be used if the pod is joined to only a single net‐
       work - i.e., --network=network-name is used at most once - and  if  the
       pod  is  not  joining  another container's network namespace via --net‐
       work=container:id.  The address must be within the network's IP address
       pool (default 10.88.0.0/16).

       To  specify multiple static IP addresses per pod, set multiple networks
       using the --network option with a static IP address specified for  each
       using the ip mode for that option.

   --ip6=ipv6
       Specify   a   static   IPv6   address   for   the   pod,   for  example
       fd46:db93:aa76:ac37::10.  This option can only be used if  the  pod  is
       joined  to only a single network - i.e., --network=network-name is used
       at most once - and if the pod is not joining another  container's  net‐
       work  namespace via --network=container:id.  The address must be within
       the network's IPv6 address pool.

       To specify multiple static IPv6 addresses per pod,  set  multiple  net‐
       works  using  the --network option with a static IPv6 address specified
       for each using the ip6 mode for that option.

   --label, -l=key=value
       Add metadata to a pod.

   --label-file=file
       Read in a line-delimited file of labels.

   --mac-address=address
       Pod network interface MAC address (e.g. 92:d0:c6:0a:29:33) This  option
       can  only be used if the pod is joined to only a single network - i.e.,
       --network=network-name is used at most once - and if  the  pod  is  not
       joining   another  container's  network  namespace  via  --network=con‐
       tainer:id.

       Remember that the MAC address in an Ethernet network  must  be  unique.
       The  IPv6  link-local address will be based on the device's MAC address
       according to RFC4862.

       To specify multiple static MAC addresses per pod, set multiple networks
       using the --network option with a static MAC address specified for each
       using the mac mode for that option.

   --memory, -m=number[unit]
       Memory limit. A unit can be b (bytes), k (kibibytes), m (mebibytes), or
       g (gibibytes).

       Allows  the  memory  available to a container to be constrained. If the
       host supports swap memory, then the -m memory  setting  can  be  larger
       than  physical  RAM.  If  a limit of 0 is specified (not using -m), the
       container's memory is not limited. The actual limit may be  rounded  up
       to  a  multiple of the operating system's page size (the value would be
       very large, that's millions of trillions).

       This option is not supported on cgroups V1 rootless systems.

   --memory-swap=number[unit]
       A limit value equal to memory plus swap.  A unit can be  b  (bytes),  k
       (kibibytes), m (mebibytes), or g (gibibytes).

       Must  be  used  with the -m (--memory) flag.  The argument value should
       always be larger than that of
        -m (--memory) By default, it is set to double the value of --memory.

       Set number to -1 to enable unlimited swap.

       This option is not supported on cgroups V1 rootless systems.

   --name, -n=name
       Assign a name to the pod.

   --network=mode, --net
       Set the network mode for the pod.

       Valid mode values are:

              • bridge[:OPTIONS,...]: Create a network stack  on  the  default
                bridge. This is the default for rootful containers. It is pos‐
                sible to specify these additional options:

                • alias=name: Add network-scoped alias for the container.

                • ip=IPv4: Specify a static ipv4 address for this container.

                • ip=IPv6: Specify a static ipv6 address for this container.

                • mac=MAC: Specify a static mac address for this container.

                • interface_name: Specify a name for the created  network  in‐
                  terface inside the container.

       For  example to set a static ipv4 address and a static mac address, use
       --network bridge:ip=10.88.0.10,mac=44:33:22:11:00:99.  - <network  name
       or  ID>[:OPTIONS,...]:  Connect  to a user-defined network; this is the
       network name or ID from a network created by podman network create. Us‐
       ing the network name implies the bridge network mode. It is possible to
       specify the same options described under the bridge mode above. You can
       use the --network option multiple times to specify additional networks.
       - none: Create a network namespace for the container but do not config‐
       ure  network  interfaces for it, thus the container has no network con‐
       nectivity.  - container:id: Reuse another container's network stack.  -
       host:  Do  not  create  a network namespace, the container will use the
       host's network. Note: The host mode gives the container full access  to
       local  system  services such as D-bus and is therefore considered inse‐
       cure.  - ns:path: Path to a network namespace to join.  - private: Cre‐
       ate  a  new  namespace for the container. This will use the bridge mode
       for  rootful  containers  and  slirp4netns  for   rootless   ones.    -
       slirp4netns[:OPTIONS,...]:  use slirp4netns(1) to create a user network
       stack. This is the default for rootless containers. It is  possible  to
       specify  these  additional  options,  they  can  also  be set with net‐
       work_cmd_options in containers.conf:
         - allow_host_loopback=true|false: Allow slirp4netns to reach the host
       loopback IP (default is 10.0.2.2 or the second IP from slirp4netns cidr
       subnet when changed, see the cidr option below). The default is false.
         - mtu=MTU: Specify the MTU to  use  for  this  network.  (Default  is
       65520).
         -  cidr=CIDR:  Specify  ip range to use for this network. (Default is
       10.0.2.0/24).
         - enable_ipv6=true|false: Enable IPv6. Default is true. (Required for
       outbound_addr6).
         -  outbound_addr=INTERFACE:  Specify  the  outbound  interface  slirp
       should bind to (ipv4 traffic only).
         - outbound_addr=IPv4: Specify the outbound ipv4 address slirp  should
       bind to.
         -  outbound_addr6=INTERFACE:  Specify  the  outbound  interface slirp
       should bind to (ipv6 traffic only).
         - outbound_addr6=IPv6: Specify the outbound ipv6 address slirp should
       bind to.
         -  port_handler=rootlesskit: Use rootlesskit for port forwarding. De‐
       fault.
         Note: Rootlesskit changes the source IP address of  incoming  packets
       to   an   IP  address  in  the  container  network  namespace,  usually
       10.0.2.100. If your application requires the real  source  IP  address,
       e.g. web server logs, use the slirp4netns port handler. The rootlesskit
       port handler is also used for rootless  containers  when  connected  to
       user-defined networks.
         -  port_handler=slirp4netns:  Use the slirp4netns port forwarding, it
       is slower than rootlesskit but preserves the correct source IP address.
       This port handler cannot be used for user-defined networks.

       Invalid  if  using  --dns, --dns-option, or --dns-search with --network
       set to none or container:id.

   --network-alias=alias
       Add a network-scoped alias for the pod, setting the alias for all  net‐
       works  that the container joins. To set a name only for a specific net‐
       work, use the alias option as described under the --network option.  If
       the  network has DNS enabled (podman network inspect -f {{.DNSEnabled}}
       <name>), these aliases can be used for name  resolution  on  the  given
       network. This option can be specified multiple times.  NOTE: When using
       CNI a pod will only have access to aliases on the first network that it
       joins. This limitation does not exist with netavark/aardvark-dns.

   --no-hosts
       Do  not  create /etc/hosts for the pod.  By default, Podman will manage
       /etc/hosts, adding the container's own IP address and  any  hosts  from
       --add-host.   --no-hosts disables this, and the image's /etc/hosts will
       be preserved unmodified.

       This option conflicts with --add-host.

   --pid=pid
       Set the PID mode for the pod. The default is to create  a  private  PID
       namespace  for  the  pod.  Requires  the PID namespace to be shared via
       --share.

              host: use the host’s PID namespace for the pod
              ns: join the specified PID namespace
              private: create a new namespace for the pod (default)

   --pod-id-file=path
       Write the pod ID to the file.

   --publish, -p=[[ip:][hostPort]:]containerPort[/protocol]
       Publish a container's port, or range of ports, within this pod  to  the
       host.

       Both  hostPort  and containerPort can be specified as a range of ports.
       When specifying ranges for both, the number of container ports  in  the
       range must match the number of host ports in the range.

       If  host IP is set to 0.0.0.0 or not set at all, the port will be bound
       on all IPs on the host.

       By default, Podman will publish TCP ports. To publish a  UDP  port  in‐
       stead,  give  udp  as  protocol. To publish both TCP and UDP ports, set
       --publish twice, with tcp, and udp as protocols  respectively.  Rootful
       containers can also publish ports using the sctp protocol.

       Host   port  does  not  have  to  be  specified  (e.g.  podman  run  -p
       127.0.0.1::80).  If it is not, the container port will be randomly  as‐
       signed a port on the host.

       Use podman port to see the actual mapping: podman port $CONTAINER $CON‐
       TAINERPORT.

       Note: You must not publish ports of containers in the pod individually,
       but only by the pod itself.

       Note: This cannot be modified once the pod is created.

   --replace
       If  another  pod  with the same name already exists, replace and remove
       it. The default is false.

   --security-opt=option
       Security Options

              • apparmor=unconfined : Turn off apparmor  confinement  for  the
                pod

              • label=disable       : Turn off label separation for the pod

       Note:  Labeling  can be disabled for all pods/containers by setting la‐
       bel=false in the  containers.conf  (/etc/containers/containers.conf  or
       $HOME/.config/containers/containers.conf) file.

              • mask=/path/1:/path/2 : The paths to mask separated by a colon.
                A masked path cannot be accessed inside the containers  within
                the pod.

              • no-new-privileges  :  Disable container processes from gaining
                additional privileges

              • seccomp=unconfined : Turn off seccomp confinement for the pod

              • seccomp=profile.json :  Whitelisted syscalls seccomp Json file
                to be used as a seccomp filter

              • proc-opts=OPTIONS : Comma-separated list of options to use for
                the /proc mount. More details for the possible  mount  options
                are specified in the proc(5) man page.

              • unmask=ALL   or   /path/1:/path/2,  or  shell  expanded  paths
                (/proc/*): Paths to unmask separated by a  colon.  If  set  to
                ALL,  it  will  unmask  all  the paths that are masked or made
                read-only  by  default.   The   default   masked   paths   are
                /proc/acpi,   /proc/kcore,   /proc/keys,  /proc/latency_stats,
                /proc/sched_debug,        /proc/scsi,        /proc/timer_list,
                /proc/timer_stats,  /sys/firmware,  and  /sys/fs/selinux.  The
                default paths that are read-only are /proc/asound,  /proc/bus,
                /proc/fs,     /proc/irq,    /proc/sys,    /proc/sysrq-trigger,
                /sys/fs/cgroup.

       Note: Labeling can be  disabled  for  all  containers  by  setting  la‐
       bel=false  in  the  containers.conf (/etc/containers/containers.conf or
       $HOME/.config/containers/containers.conf) file.

   --share=namespace
       A comma-separated list of kernel namespaces to share. If none or ""  is
       specified,  no  namespaces  will be shared and the infra container will
       not be created unless expiclity specified via --infra=true.  The  name‐
       spaces  to choose from are cgroup, ipc, net, pid, uts. If the option is
       prefixed with a "+" then the namespace is appended to the default list,
       otherwise it replaces the default list. Defaults matches Kubernetes de‐
       fault (ipc, net, uts)

   --share-parent
       This boolean determines whether or not all containers entering the  pod
       will use the pod as their cgroup parent. The default value of this flag
       is true. If you are looking to share the cgroup namespace rather than a
       cgroup parent in a pod, use --share

       Note:  This  options  conflict with --share=cgroup since that would set
       the pod as the cgroup parent but enter  the  container  into  the  same
       cgroupNS as the infra container.

   --shm-size=number[unit]
       Size   of  /dev/shm.  A  unit  can  be  b  (bytes),  k  (kibibytes),  m
       (mebibytes), or g (gibibytes).  If the unit is omitted, the system uses
       bytes.  If  the  size  is omitted, the default is 64m.  When size is 0,
       there is no limit on the amount of memory used  for  IPC  by  the  pod.
       This option conflicts with --ipc=host.

   --subgidname=name
       Run  the  container  in a new user namespace using the map with name in
       the /etc/subgid file.  If running rootless, the user needs to have  the
       right  to  use  the  mapping.  See subgid(5).  This flag conflicts with
       --userns and --gidmap.

   --subuidname=name
       Run the container in a new user namespace using the map  with  name  in
       the  /etc/subuid file.  If running rootless, the user needs to have the
       right to use the mapping. See  subuid(5).   This  flag  conflicts  with
       --userns and --uidmap.

   --sysctl=name=value
       Configure namespaced kernel parameters for all containers in the pod.

       For the IPC namespace, the following sysctls are allowed:

              • kernel.msgmax

              • kernel.msgmnb

              • kernel.msgmni

              • kernel.sem

              • kernel.shmall

              • kernel.shmmax

              • kernel.shmmni

              • kernel.shm_rmid_forced

              • Sysctls beginning with fs.mqueue.*

       Note:  if  the  ipc  namespace  is not shared within the pod, the above
       sysctls are not allowed.

       For the network namespace, only sysctls beginning with  net.*  are  al‐
       lowed.

       Note:  if the network namespace is not shared within the pod, the above
       sysctls are not allowed.

   --uidmap=container_uid:from_uid:amount
       Run all containers in the pod in a new user namespace  using  the  sup‐
       plied mapping. This option conflicts with the --userns and --subuidname
       options. This option provides a way to map host UIDs to container UIDs.
       It can be passed several times to map different ranges.

   --userns=mode
       Set  the  user  namespace  mode for all the containers in a pod. It de‐
       faults to the PODMAN_USERNS environment variable. An empty  value  ("")
       means user namespaces are disabled.

       Rootless user --userns=Key mappings:

       ┌────────┬───────────┬─────────────────────┐

       └────────┴───────────┴─────────────────────┘

       Valid mode values are:

              • auto[:OPTIONS,...]: automatically create a  namespace.  It  is
                possible to specify these options to auto:

              • gidmapping=_CONTAINER_GID:HOSTGID:SIZE  to force a GID mapping
                to be present in the user namespace.

              • size=SIZE: to specify an explicit size for the automatic  user
                namespace. e.g. --userns=auto:size=8192. If size is not speci‐
                fied, auto will estimate a size for the user namespace.

              • uidmapping=_CONTAINER_UID:HOSTUID:SIZE to force a UID  mapping
                to be present in the user namespace.

              • host:  run  in the user namespace of the caller. The processes
                running in the container will have the same privileges on  the
                host  as  any  other process launched by the calling user (de‐
                fault).

              • keep-id: creates a user namespace where the  current  rootless
                user's UID:GID are mapped to the same values in the container.
                This option is not allowed for containers created by the  root
                user.

              • nomap:  creates  a  user  namespace where the current rootless
                user's UID:GID are not mapped into the container. This  option
                is not allowed for containers created by the root user.

   --uts=mode
       Set  the  UTS namespace mode for the pod. The following values are sup‐
       ported:

              • host: use the host's UTS namespace inside the pod.

              • private: create a new namespace for the pod (default).

              • ns:[path]: run the pod in the given existing UTS namespace.

   --volume, -v=[[SOURCE-VOLUME|HOST-DIR:]CONTAINER-DIR[:OPTIONS]]
       Create a bind mount. If -v /HOST-DIR:/CONTAINER-DIR is specified,  Pod‐
       man bind mounts /HOST-DIR from the host into /CONTAINER-DIR in the Pod‐
       man container. Similarly, -v  SOURCE-VOLUME:/CONTAINER-DIR  will  mount
       the  named  volume  from  the host into the container. If no such named
       volume exists, Podman will create one. If no source is given, the  vol‐
       ume will be created as an anonymously named volume with a randomly gen‐
       erated name, and will be removed when the pod is removed via  the  --rm
       flag or the podman rm --volumes command.

       (Note  when using the remote client, including Mac and Windows (exclud‐
       ing WSL2) machines, the volumes will be mounted from the remote server,
       not necessarily the client machine.)

       The OPTIONS is a comma-separated list and can be: [1] ⟨#Footnote1⟩

              • rw|ro

              • z|Z

              • [O]

              • [U]

              • [no]copy

              • [no]dev

              • [no]exec

              • [no]suid

              • [r]bind

              • [r]shared|[r]slave|[r]private[r]unbindable

       The  CONTAINER-DIR must be an absolute path such as /src/docs. The vol‐
       ume will be mounted into the container at this directory.

       If a volume source is specified, it must be a path on the host  or  the
       name  of a named volume. Host paths are allowed to be absolute or rela‐
       tive; relative paths are resolved relative to the directory  Podman  is
       run  in.  If  the  source  does not exist, Podman will return an error.
       Users must pre-create the source files or directories.

       Any source that does not begin with a . or / will  be  treated  as  the
       name  of  a named volume. If a volume with that name does not exist, it
       will be created.  Volumes created with names  are  not  anonymous,  and
       they  are  not  removed  by the --rm option and the podman rm --volumes
       command.

       Specify multiple -v options to mount one or more volumes into a pod.

       Write Protected Volume Mounts

       Add :ro or :rw option to mount a  volume  in  read-only  or  read-write
       mode,  respectively.  By  default,  the volumes are mounted read-write.
       See examples.

       Chowning Volume Mounts

       By default, Podman does not change the owner and group of source volume
       directories  mounted into containers. If a pod is created in a new user
       namespace, the UID and GID in the container may correspond  to  another
       UID and GID on the host.

       The :U suffix tells Podman to use the correct host UID and GID based on
       the UID and GID within the pod, to change  recursively  the  owner  and
       group of the source volume.

       Warning use with caution since this will modify the host filesystem.

       Labeling Volume Mounts

       Labeling  systems like SELinux require that proper labels are placed on
       volume content mounted into a pod. Without a label, the security system
       might  prevent the processes running inside the pod from using the con‐
       tent. By default, Podman does not change the labels set by the OS.

       To change a label in the pod context, add either of two suffixes :z  or
       :Z  to the volume mount. These suffixes tell Podman to relabel file ob‐
       jects on the shared volumes. The z option tells Podman  that  two  pods
       share the volume content. As a result, Podman labels the content with a
       shared content label. Shared volume  labels  allow  all  containers  to
       read/write  content.   The  Z  option tells Podman to label the content
       with a private unshared label.  Only the current pod can use a  private
       volume.

       Note:  Do  not  relabel system files and directories. Relabeling system
       content might cause other confined services on your  machine  to  fail.
       For  these  types  of containers we recommend disabling SELinux separa‐
       tion.  The option --security-opt label=disable disables SELinux separa‐
       tion  for  the pod.  For example if a user wanted to volume mount their
       entire home directory into a pod, they need to disable SELinux  separa‐
       tion.

                 $ podman pod create --security-opt label=disable -v $HOME:/home/user fedora touch /home/user/file

       Overlay Volume Mounts

       The :O flag tells Podman to mount the directory from the host as a tem‐
       porary storage using the overlay file system.  The  pod  processes  can
       modify  content  within the mountpoint which is stored in the container
       storage in a separate directory. In overlay terms, the source directory
       will  be the lower, and the container storage directory will be the up‐
       per. Modifications to the mount point are destroyed when the  pod  fin‐
       ishes executing, similar to a tmpfs mount point being unmounted.

       For  advanced  users,  the  overlay  option  also  supports custom non-
       volatile upperdir and workdir for the overlay  mount.  Custom  upperdir
       and  workdir  can  be fully managed by the users themselves, and Podman
       will  not  remove  it  on   lifecycle   completion.    Example   :O,up‐
       perdir=/some/upper,workdir=/some/work

       Subsequent executions of the container will see the original source di‐
       rectory content, any changes from previous pod executions no longer ex‐
       ist.

       One use case of the overlay mount is sharing the package cache from the
       host into the container to allow speeding up builds.

       Note:

               - The `O` flag conflicts with other options listed above.

       Content mounted into the container is labeled with the private label.
              On SELinux systems, labels in the source directory must be read‐
       able by the pod infra container label. Usually containers can read/exe‐
       cute container_share_t and can read/write container_file_t.  If  unable
       to  change  the labels on a source volume, SELinux container separation
       must be disabled for the pod or infra container to work.
            - The source directory mounted into the pod with an overlay  mount
       should  not be modified, it can cause unexpected failures. It is recom‐
       mended to not modify the directory until the  container  finishes  run‐
       ning.

       Mounts propagation

       By default bind mounted volumes are private. That means any mounts done
       inside the pod will not be visible on host  and  vice  versa.  One  can
       change this behavior by specifying a volume mount propagation property.
       Making a volume shared mounts done under that  volume  inside  the  pod
       will  be  visible on host and vice versa. Making a volume slave enables
       only one way mount propagation and that is mounts done  on  host  under
       that  volume  will  be  visible  inside container but not the other way
       around. [1] ⟨#Footnote1⟩

       To control mount propagation property of  a  volume  one  can  use  the
       [r]shared,  [r]slave, [r]private or the [r]unbindable propagation flag.
       Propagation property can be specified only for bind mounted volumes and
       not  for  internal  volumes  or named volumes. For mount propagation to
       work the source mount point  (the  mount  point  where  source  dir  is
       mounted  on)  has  to have the right propagation properties. For shared
       volumes, the source mount point has to be shared. And  for  slave  vol‐
       umes,  the  source  mount  point has to be either shared or slave.  [1]
       ⟨#Footnote1⟩

       To recursively mount a volume and all of its submounts into a pod,  use
       the  rbind option. By default the bind option is used, and submounts of
       the source directory will not be mounted into the pod.

       Mounting the volume with the nosuid options means  that  SUID  applica‐
       tions  on the volume will not be able to change their privilege. By de‐
       fault volumes are mounted with nosuid.

       Mounting the volume with the noexec option means that no executables on
       the volume will be able to be executed within the pod.

       Mounting  the volume with the nodev option means that no devices on the
       volume will be able to be used by processes within the pod. By  default
       volumes are mounted with nodev.

       If  the HOST-DIR is a mount point, then dev, suid, and exec options are
       ignored by the kernel.

       Use df HOST-DIR to figure out the source mount,  then  use  findmnt  -o
       TARGET,PROPAGATION  source-mount-dir  to figure out propagation proper‐
       ties of source mount. If findmnt(1) utility is not available, then  one
       can   look   at   the  mount  entry  for  the  source  mount  point  in
       /proc/self/mountinfo. Look at the "optional  fields"  and  see  if  any
       propagation  properties  are  specified.   In there, shared:N means the
       mount is shared, master:N means mount  is  slave,  and  if  nothing  is
       there, the mount is private. [1] ⟨#Footnote1⟩

       To  change  propagation  properties of a mount point, use mount(8) com‐
       mand. For example, if one wants to bind mount  source  directory  /foo,
       one  can  do  mount  --bind  /foo /foo and mount --make-private --make-
       shared /foo. This will convert /foo into a shared mount point. Alterna‐
       tively, one can directly change propagation properties of source mount.
       Say / is source mount for /foo, then use mount --make-shared / to  con‐
       vert / into a shared mount.

       Note:  if  the  user  only has access rights via a group, accessing the
       volume from inside a rootless pod will fail.

   --volumes-from=CONTAINER[:OPTIONS]
       Mount volumes from the specified container(s). Used  to  share  volumes
       between containers and pods. The options is a comma-separated list with
       the following available elements:

              • rw|ro

              • z

       Mounts already mounted volumes from a  source  container  onto  another
       pod.  CONTAINER may be a name or ID.  To share a volume, use the --vol‐
       umes-from option when running the  target  container.  Volumes  can  be
       shared even if the source container is not running.

       By  default,  Podman mounts the volumes in the same mode (read-write or
       read-only) as it is mounted in  the  source  container.   This  can  be
       changed by adding a ro or rw option.

       Labeling  systems like SELinux require that proper labels are placed on
       volume content mounted into a pod. Without a label, the security system
       might prevent the processes running inside the container from using the
       content. By default, Podman does not change the labels set by the OS.

       To change a label in the pod context, add z to the volume mount.   This
       suffix  tells Podman to relabel file objects on the shared volumes. The
       z option tells Podman that two entities share the volume content. As  a
       result,  Podman  labels the content with a shared content label. Shared
       volume labels allow all containers to read/write content.

       If the location of the volume from the source container  overlaps  with
       data  residing  on a target pod, then the volume hides that data on the
       target.

EXAMPLES
              $ podman pod create --name test

              $ podman pod create mypod

              $ podman pod create --infra=false

              $ podman pod create --infra-command /top toppod

              $ podman pod create --publish 8443:443

              $ podman pod create --network slirp4netns:outbound_addr=127.0.0.1,allow_host_loopback=true

              $ podman pod create --network slirp4netns:cidr=192.168.0.0/24

FOOTNOTES
       1: The Podman project is committed to inclusivity, a core value of open
       source. The master and slave mount propagation terminology used here is
       problematic and divisive, and should be changed. However,  these  terms
       are  currently  used  within the Linux kernel and must be used as-is at
       this time. When the kernel maintainers rectify this usage, Podman  will
       follow suit immediately.
