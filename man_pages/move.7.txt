NAME

MOVE âˆ’
position a cursor

SYNOPSIS

MOVE [
direction { FROM | IN } ] cursorname

DESCRIPTION

MOVE
repositions a cursor without retrieving any data.
MOVE works exactly like the FETCH command,
except it only positions the cursor and does not return
rows.

Refer to FETCH
[fetch(7)] for details on syntax and usage.

OUTPUTS

On successful
completion, a MOVE command returns a command tag of
the form

MOVE
count

The
count is the number of rows moved over (possibly
zero).

EXAMPLES

BEGIN WORK;

DECLARE liahona CURSOR FOR SELECT * FROM films;

-- Skip the
first 5 rows: 
MOVE FORWARD 5 IN liahona; 
MOVE 5

-- Fetch the
6th row from the cursor liahona: 
FETCH 1 FROM liahona; 
code | title | did | date_prod | kind | len 
-------+--------+-----+------------+--------+------- 
P_303 | 48 Hrs | 103 | 1982-10-22 | Action | 01:37 
(1 row)

-- Close the
cursor liahona and end the transaction: 
CLOSE liahona; 
COMMIT WORK;

MOVE statement in the SQL standard.
