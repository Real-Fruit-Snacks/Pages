NAME

cdbs-edit-patch
- create or edit a CDBS simple-patchsys.mk patch

SYNOPSIS

cdbs-edit-patch
patchname

DESCRIPTION

cdbs-edit-patch
creates or edits patches for use by the CDBS
simple-patchsys.mk patch system. For more information about
CDBS please see the documentation under
/usr/share/doc/cdbs/.

When
patchname exists, cdbs-edit-patch will set up
a temporary working source tree, apply all patches up to and
including patchname in lexicographic order, and spawn
an interactive shell for the developer. The developer can
then edit files in this working tree. When the developer is
done and exits the shell, cdbs-edit-patch updates
patchname to reflect the changes made. To abort the
process from the interactive shell, exit with a nonzero exit
value.

When
patchname does not exist, cdbs-edit-patch will
assume that a new patch should be created. As with the above
scenario, cdbs-edit-patch will first create a
temporary working source tree and apply all patches up to
the new patch in lexicographic order. When the shell is
quit, cdbs-edit-patch will create
patchname.
