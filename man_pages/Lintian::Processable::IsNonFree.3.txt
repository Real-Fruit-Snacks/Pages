Lintian::Processable::IsNonFDebian Package CLintian::Processable::IsNonFree(3)

NAME
       Lintian::Processable::IsNonFree - Lintian interface to source package
       data collection

SYNOPSIS
           my ($name, $type, $dir) = ('foobar', 'source', '/path/to/lab-entry');
           my $collect = Lintian::Processable::IsNonFree->new($name);
           if ($collect->native) {
               print encode_utf8("Package is native\n");
           }

DESCRIPTION
       Lintian::Processable::IsNonFree provides an interface to package data
       for source packages.  It implements data collection methods specific to
       source packages.

       This module is in its infancy.  Most of Lintian still reads all data
       from files in the laboratory whenever that data is needed and generates
       that data via collect scripts.  The goal is to eventually access all
       data about source packages via this module so that the module can cache
       data where appropriate and possibly retire collect scripts in favor of
       caching that data in memory.

INSTANCE METHODS
       is_non_free
           Returns a truth value if the package appears to be non-free (based
           on the section field; "non-free/*" and "restricted/*")
