FETESTEXCEPT(3POSIX)       POSIX Programmer's Manual      FETESTEXCEPT(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       fetestexcept — test floating-point exception flags

SYNOPSIS
       #include <fenv.h>

       int fetestexcept(int excepts);

DESCRIPTION
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with  the
       ISO C  standard.  Any  conflict between the requirements described here
       and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017
       defers to the ISO C standard.

       The fetestexcept() function shall determine which of a specified subset
       of the floating-point exception flags are currently  set.  The  excepts
       argument specifies the floating-point status flags to be queried.

RETURN VALUE
       The  fetestexcept()  function shall return the value of the bitwise-in‐
       clusive OR of the floating-point exception macros corresponding to  the
       currently set floating-point exceptions included in excepts.

ERRORS
       No errors are defined.

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       The  following  example  calls  function f() if an invalid exception is
       set, and then function g() if an overflow exception is set:

           #include <fenv.h>
           /* ... */
           {
               #pragma STDC FENV_ACCESS ON
               int set_excepts;
               feclearexcept(FE_INVALID | FE_OVERFLOW);
               // maybe raise exceptions
               set_excepts = fetestexcept(FE_INVALID | FE_OVERFLOW);
               if (set_excepts & FE_INVALID) f();
               if (set_excepts & FE_OVERFLOW) g();
               /* ... */
           }

APPLICATION USAGE
       None.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
