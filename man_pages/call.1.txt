NAME

axcall - make
an AX.25, NET/ROM or Rose connection.

SYNOPSIS

For AX.25

axcall [-b l|e] [-d] [-h] [-m s|e] [-p paclen] [-s mycall]
[-r] [-t] [-T timeout] [-v] [-w window] [-W] port callsign
[[via] digipeaters.....]

For NET/ROM

axcall [-d] [-h] [-p paclen] [-r] [-t] [-T timeout] [-v]
port callsign

For Rose

axcall [-d] [-h] [-r] [-t] [-T timeout] [-v] port callsign
address [[via] digipeater]

DESCRIPTION

Axcall
is the general purpose AX.25, NET/ROM and Rose connection
program. As is normal in AX.25 it runs entirely in line
mode. All CR/LF translation is done transparently. The
program provides ASCII, YAPP, YAPP-C and 7+ file transfer
facilities. Some of the options are only valid in AX.25
mode, the program will quietly ignore them if given in
NET/ROM mode or in Rose mode.

This version of
axcall incorporates many changes that include a much
improved user interface. The port name is mandatory and is
the name of the port which the connection will be made on.
The port name may be either an AX.25, a NET/ROM port or a
Rose port, axcall will determine which
automatically.

When using
NET/ROM the use of digipeaters is meaningless and is not
supported. However when using Rose up to one digipeater may
be specified, as well as the Rose address of the distant
node and the callsign of the remote station. The Rose
address must be ten digits long and it must exist in the
Rose node tables. For Rose connects to work axparms
must have been used to set a callsign/uid mapping for the
userid in use.

OPTIONS

-8

UTF-8 encoding (default)

-b l|e

Sets the method of backoff to use with AX.25
connections. The default is taken from the port
specification, but can be overridden by this option. Valid
values are l for linear backoff, and e for
exponential backoff.

-d

Turn on socket level debugging.

-h

Selects Slave mode.

-i

Use IBM850 encoding

-m s|e

Sets the AX.25 mode to use. The default is taken from
the port specification, but can be overridden by this
option. Valid values are s for normal (modulus 8)
AX.25 operation, or e for extended (modulus 128)
AX.25 operation.

-p paclen

Specify a specific maximum amount of data to be sent in
each AX.25 packet.

-r

Selects Raw mode.

-s mycall

Connect using the specified source axcall (you may need
to be root).

-t

Selects Talk mode.

-v

Display the version.

-w window

Specify a specific AX.25 window for this connection.
Only valid in AX.25 mode.

-S

Be silent. Useful for using axcall in shellscripts
(together with option -r) in order to be really
transparent. 

-R

Disable all remote commands like autobin (#BIN#), 7plus
downloads, //echo, etc. This is useful for scripting where
you just don&rsquo;t like the remote site to trigger
uncaught conditions here.

-T timeout

Set idle timeout seconds after
a connection will be closed automatically when there&rsquo;s
no data being transferred (in- and outbound). If timeout is
set to 3600, the connection will close after 1h inactivity.
A value of 0.5 is 500ms.

-W

Wait for remote disconnect even if stdin is closed.
Normally, "echo q | axcall ax0 db0fhn" closes
immediately after "echo q" terminates; thus we
never see the greeting from db0fhn. With the -W option,
axcall waits until the ax25-connection is disconnected (i.e.
db0fhn disconnects after "q" command). Very useful
for scripting. You might like to combine it with the -T
option. 

The axcall
program interprets lines beginning with a &rsquo;~&rsquo;
specially. The following &rsquo;~&rsquo; escapes are
available.

~?

List escapes

~~

A ~ symbol

~.

Close connection

~! [command]

Run a command

~0

Change to Raw mode

~1

Change to Slave mode

~2

Change to Talk mode

~8

UTF-8 encoding

~a

Start a file transfer (Autobin)

~b

Start a file transfer (Binary)

~c

Close the logfile

~h

List escapes

~i

IBM850 encoding

~o [filename]

Open a logfile (default &rsquo;logfile.txt&rsquo;)

~r

Reconnect to remote station

~s

Stop an upload

~u [filename]

Upload a file (ASCII upload)

~yu [filename]

Upload a file (YAPP upload)

~yd [filename]

Download a file (YAPP download)

~z

Suspend program

The program
provides no terminal emulation features. These are left up
to the console facilities of the terminal in use. The
program is however &rsquo;8 bit clean&rsquo;.
