MOS(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual MOS(4)

NAME

mos &mdash; Moschip
MCS7730/MCS7830/MCS7832 USB Ethernet driver

SYNOPSIS

To compile this driver into the
kernel, place the following lines in your kernel
configuration file:

device uhci

device ohci 
device ehci 
device usb 
device miibus 
device uether 
device mos

Alternatively,
to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following line in loader.conf(5):

if_mos_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION

The mos driver provides
support for USB Ethernet adapters based on the Moschip
MCS7730/MCS7830/MCS7832 chipset.

The adapters
that contain the Moschip MCS7730/MCS7830/MCS7832 chipset
will operate at 100Base-TX and full-duplex.

The Moschip
contains a 10/100 Ethernet MAC with MII interface and is
designed to work with both Ethernet and HomePNA
transceivers. Although designed to interface with 100Mbps
peripherals, this only works with USB 2.0. The existing USB
1.0 standard specifies a maximum transfer speed of 12Mbps.
USB 1.0 Users should therefore not expect to actually
achieve 100Mbps speeds with these devices.

The Moschip
supports a 64-bit multicast hash table, single perfect
filter entry for the station address and promiscuous mode.
Packets are received and transmitted over separate USB bulk
transfer endpoints.

For more
information on configuring this device, see ifconfig(8).

mos driver include:
