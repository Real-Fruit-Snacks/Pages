NAME

DROP TRIGGER
âˆ’ remove a trigger

SYNOPSIS

DROP TRIGGER
name ON table [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]

DESCRIPTION

DROP
TRIGGER will remove an existing trigger definition. To
execute this command, the current user must be the owner of
the table for which the trigger is defined.

PARAMETERS

name

The name of the trigger to
remove. 

table

The name (optionally schema-qualified) of a table for
which the trigger is defined.

CASCADE

Automatically drop objects that
depend on the trigger.

RESTRICT

Refuse to drop the trigger if
any objects depend on it. This is the default.

EXAMPLES

Destroy the
trigger if_dist_exists on the table films:

DROP TRIGGER
if_dist_exists ON films;

COMPATIBILITY

The DROP
TRIGGER statement in PostgreSQL is incompatible with the
SQL standard. In the SQL standard, trigger names are not
local to tables, so the command is simply DROP TRIGGER
name.
