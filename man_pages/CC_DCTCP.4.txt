NAME

cc_dctcp &mdash; DCTCP
Congestion Control Algorithm

DESCRIPTION

The DCTCP (data center TCP)
congestion control algorithm aims to maximise throughput and
minimise latency in data center networks by utilising the
proportion of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) marks
received from capable hardware as a congestion signal.

DCTCP uses
fraction of ECN marked packets to update congestion window.
The window reduction ratio is always 

In order to keep
the accuracy of the ECN marked fraction, a DCTCP receiver
mirrors back incoming (or missing) CE marks by setting (or
clearing) ECE marks. This feedback methodology is also
adopted when the receiver uses delayed ACK.

The FreeBSD
DCTCP implementation includes two minor modifications for
the one-sided deployment. Considering the situation that
DCTCP is used as sender and classic ECN is used as receiver,
DCTCP sets the CWR flag as the reaction to the ECE flag. In
addition, when classic ECN is used as sender and DCTCP is
used as receiver, DCTCP avoids to mirror back ACKs only when
the CWR flag is set in the incoming packet.

The other
specifications are based on the paper and Internet Draft
referenced in the SEE ALSO section below.

MIB Variables

The algorithm exposes the
following tunable variables in the
net.inet.tcp.cc.dctcp branch of the sysctl(3)
MIB:

alpha

An initial
estimator of the congestion on the link. Default is 0.

dctcp_shift_g

An estimation gain in the alpha
calculation. Default is 16.

slowstart

A trigger to halve congestion
window after slow start. Default does nothing to halve
window.
