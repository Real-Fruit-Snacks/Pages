NAME

t1dotlessj -
create a dotless-j PostScript Type 1 font

SYNOPSIS

t1dotlessj
[OPTIONS...] font [outputfile]

DESCRIPTION

T1dotlessj
creates a PostScript Type 1 font whose only character
is a dotless ’j’ matching the input font’s
design. It works simply by removing the dot from the input
font’s ’j’. The output font has three
characters: ’.notdef’, ’space’, and
’uni0237’, where ’uni0237’ is the
dotless ’j’. The command fails if the input font
already has a dotless ’j’ character, or if there
seems to be no dot to remove. T1dotlessj writes the created
PFA or PFB font to the standard output (but see the
--output option); if no input file is supplied, it
reads a PFA or PFB font from the standard input.
