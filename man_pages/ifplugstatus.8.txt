NAME

ifplugstatus -
A link beat detection tool

SYNOPSIS

ifplugstatus
[options] [INTERFACE]

DESCRIPTION

ifplugstatus is
an utility which may be used to detect the link status of a
local Linux ethernet device, much in the same way mii-diag,
mii-tool and ethtool work. In fact it supports all three
different APIs these three tools use. In addition it
supports link checking with the IFF_RUNNING interface flag,
which most modern drivers (not only ethernet) support, and
association status checking with the wireless extension API
for WLAN devices.

The APIs are
tried in the following order:

First the
newest API: SIOCETHTOOL (aka ethtool API)

Second the next
older API: SIOCGMIIREG (aka mii-diag API)

Than the WLAN
API: wireless extension (aka iwconfig API)

Followed by the
cleanest API: IFF_RUNNING (aka ifconfig API)

The oldest API
(SIOCPRIV aka mii-tool API) is not tested since it is
obsolete.

ifplugstatus
may be used in shell script since it returns the current
status as return value. It is especially useful to detect
the available APIs on the used network driver. (Option
-v)

OPTIONS

You may specify
an ethernet device on the command line. Otherwise
ifplugstatus will check all available network interfaces.

-a | --auto

Enable interface automatically
before querying (default: off)

-h | --help

Show help

-q | --quiet

Decrease verbosity by one. If
the verbosity is  0, detailed
information about the used API is returned. (By default the
verbosity is 0)

-v | --verbose

Increase verbosity by one. See
option -q.

-V | --version

Show version

RETURN VALUES
