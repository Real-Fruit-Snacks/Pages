FDWRITE(1) BSD General Commands Manual FDWRITE(1)

NAME

fdwrite &mdash; format
and write floppy disks

SYNOPSIS

fdwrite
[&minus;v] [&minus;y]
[&minus;f inputfile]
[&minus;d device]

DESCRIPTION

The fdwrite utility
formats and writes one and more floppy disks. Any floppy
disk device capable of formatting can be used.

The
fdwrite utility will ask the user (on
/dev/tty) to insert a new floppy and press return.
The device will then be opened, and queried for its
parameters, then each track will be formatted, written with
data from the inputfile, read back and compared. When
the floppy disk is filled, the process is repeated, with the
next disk. This continues until the program is interrupted
or EOF is encountered on the inputfile.

The options are
as follows:

&minus;v

Toggle
verbosity on stdout. Default is
&rsquo;&rsquo;on&rsquo;&rsquo;. After device is
opened first time the format will be printed. During
operation progress will be reported with the number of
tracks remaining on the current floppy disk, and the letters
I, Z, F, W, R and C, which indicates completion of Input,
Zero-fill, Format Write, Read and Compare of current track
respectively.

&minus;y

Don&rsquo;t ask
for presence of a floppy disk in the drive. This
non-interactive flag is useful for shell scripts.

&minus;f
inputfile

Input file to read. If none is
given, stdin is assumed.

&minus;d
device

The name of the
floppy device to write to. Default is /dev/fd0.

The
fdwrite utility actually closes the device
while it waits for the user to press return, it is thus
quite possible to use the drive for other purposes at this
time and later resume writing with the next floppy.

The parameters
returned from device are used for formatting. If
custom formatting is needed, please use fdformat(1)
instead.

EXAMPLES

The fdwrite utility was
planned as a tool to make life easier when writing a set of
floppies, one such use could be to write a tar-archive:

tar cf - . |
gzip -9 | fdwrite -d /dev/fd0.1720 -v

The main
difference from using tar(1)&rsquo;s multivolume facility is
of course the formatting of the floppies, which here is done
on the fly, thus reducing the amount of work for the
floppy-jockey.

HISTORY

The fdwrite utility was
written while waiting for &rsquo;&rsquo;make
world&rsquo;&rsquo; to complete. Some of the code was taken
from fdformat(1).

BUGS

Diagnostics are less than
complete at present.

If a floppy is
sick, and the inputfile is seekable, it should ask
the user to frisbee the disk, insert another, and rewind to
the right spot and continue.

This concept
could be extended to cover non-seekable input also by
employing a temporary file.

An option
(defaulting to zero) should allow the user to ask for
retries in case of failure.

At present a
suitable tool for reading back a multivolume set of floppies
is missing. Programs like tar(1) for instance, will do the
job, if the data has not been compressed. One can always
trust dd(1) to help out in this situation of course.
