DESCRIPTION

Secure Locate
provides a secure way to index and quickly search for files
on your system. It uses incremental encoding just like GNU
locate to compress its database to make searching faster,
but it will also store file permissions and ownership so
that users will not see files they do not have access
to.

This manual
page documents the GNU version of slocate.
slocate Enables system users to search entire
filesystems without displaying unauthorized files.
