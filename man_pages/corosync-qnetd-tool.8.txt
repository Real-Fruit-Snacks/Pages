NAME

corosync-qnetd-tool
- corosync-qnetd control interface.

SYNOPSIS

corosync-qnetd-tool
[-Hhlsv] [-c cluster_name] [-p
qnetd_ipc_socket_path]

DESCRIPTION

corosync-qnetd-tool
is a frontend to the internal corosync-qnetd IPC. Its main
purpose is to show important information about the current
internal state of corosync-qnetd.

OPTIONS

-H

Properly shutdown the
corosync-qnetd process

-h

Display a short usage text

-l

List all clients connected to the corosync-qnetd
process. The output is described in its own section
below. 

-s

Display status of the corosync-qnetd process.

-v

Display more verbose output for options -l and
-s 

-c

Used only with the -l option. By default,
information about all clients from all clusters is
displayed, with this option itâ€™s possible to filter
information from a single cluster given the
cluster_name. 

-p

Path to the corosync-qnetd communication
socket. 

LIST COMMAND OUTPUT

Cluster
"Cluster": 
Algorithm: Fifty-Fifty split (KAP Tie-breaker) 
Tie-breaker: Node with lowest node ID 
Node ID 1: 
Client address: ::ffff:127.0.0.1:52000 
HB interval: 8000ms 
Configured node list: 1, 2 
Ring ID: 1.a00000000021b40 
Membership node list: 1, 2 
TLS active: Yes (client certificate verified) 
Vote: No change (ACK) 
...

The output
contains a list of clusters. Each cluster has the cluster
common options Algorithm (optionally with Keep Active
Partition Tie Breaker information) and Tie-breaker as
configured in the corosync.conf file. Information about
nodes follows. Client address is the IP address and
port of the client. HB interval is the heartbeat
interval between corosync-qnetd and
corosync-qdevice client. This option can be
configured in corosync.conf. Configured node list is
the list of nodes configured in corosync.conf. Ring
ID and Membership node list are self-explanatory.
TLS active describes if an encrypted transport is
used between server and client. Vote is last vote
sent to corosync-qdevice client. The last ACK/NACK
vote (if it exists) is in parentheses.
