NAME

ls, lc - list
contents of directory

SYNOPSIS

ls [
-dlmnpqrstuFQ ] name ...

lc [
-dlmnpqrstuFQ ] name ...

DESCRIPTION

For each
directory argument, ls lists the contents of the
directory; for each file argument, ls repeats its
name and any other information requested. When no argument
is given, the current directory is listed. By default, the
output is sorted alphabetically by name.

Lc is
the same as ls, but sets the -p option and
pipes the output through mc(1).

There are a
number of options:

-d

If argument is a directory, list it, not its
contents. 

-l

List in long format, giving mode (see below), file
system type (e.g., for devices, the # code letter
that names it; see intro(3)), the instance or
subdevice number, owner, group, size in bytes, and time of
last modification for each file.

-m

List the name of the user who most recently modified the
file. 

-n

Don’t sort the listing.

-p

Print only the final path element of each file name.

-q

List the qid (see stat(3)) of each file;
the printed fields are in the order path, version, and
type. 

-r

Reverse the order of sort.

-s

Give size in Kbytes for each entry.

-t

Sort by time modified (latest first) instead of by
name. 

-u

Under -t sort by time of last access; under
-l print time of last access.

-F

Add the character / after all directory names and
the character * after all executable files.

-L

Print the character t before each file if it has
the temporary flag set, and - otherwise.

-Q

By default, printed file names are quoted if they
contain characters special to rc(1). The -Q
flag disables this behavior.

The mode
printed under the -l option contains 11 characters,
interpreted as follows: the first character is

d

if the entry is a directory;

a

if the entry is an append-only file;

D

if the entry is a Unix device;

L

if the entry is a symbolic link;

P

if the entry is a named pipe;

S

if the entry is a socket;

-

if the entry is a plain file.

The next letter
is l if the file is exclusive access (one writer or
reader at a time).

The last 9
characters are interpreted as three sets of three bits each.
The first set refers to owner permissions; the next to
permissions to others in the same user-group; and the last
to all others. Within each set the three characters indicate
permission respectively to read, to write, or to execute the
file as a program. For a directory, ’execute’
permission is interpreted to mean permission to search the
directory for a specified file. The permissions are
indicated as follows:

r

if the file is readable;

w

if the file is writable;

x

if the file is executable;

-

if none of the above permissions is granted.
