NAME
       pambayer - interpret Bayer patterns

SYNOPSIS
       pambayer -type={1|2|3|4} [-nointerpolate] [pamfile]

       Minimum  unique abbreviation of option is acceptable.  You may use dou‐
       ble hyphens instead of single hyphen to denote options.   You  may  use
       white space in place of the equals sign to separate an option name from
       its value.

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       pambayer reads a Bayer pattern in a 1-deep Netpbm image and produces  a
       color image in PAM RGB format as output.

       A Bayer pattern is what you get from the optical sensor in some digital
       cameras.  Such a camera doesn't have a red, green, and blue  sensor  in
       the  exact  same  place  for an individual pixel.  Instead, it has red,
       green, and blue sensors laid out in a two dimensional array.  The  pat‐
       tern  in  which  they  are laid out is the Bayer pattern.  The input to
       pambayer is one sample value for each of those sensors, so some samples
       are red, some are green, and some are blue.

       pambayer turns that into a regular visual image with one pixel per sen‐
       sor.  For the two components of each pixel that are missing in the cor‐
       responding  Bayer  input,  pambayer averages the sample values from the
       adjacent pixels that do have that component.

       But you can have pambayer fill in black instead (see  the  -noninterpo‐
       late option), which gives you a simpler representation of what the cam‐
       era saw, on which you might do further processing.  Such an image still
       looks  right,  though considerably dimmer, if you stand far enough away
       and let your eyes do the interpolation.

       The input image is a pseudo-PNM image (pseudo- because while the struc‐
       ture is the same, the sample values have different meanings) or PAM im‐
       age of arbitrary tuple type.  pambayer looks at only the first plane of
       the input.

       The  output  image is a PAM image of tuple type "RGB", i.e.  a standard
       color image.  You can convert this to PPM with pamtopnm(1).

       If you're interested in just one of the primary colors, use  pamchannel
       on the output of pambayer to extract it.

OPTIONS
       In  addition  to  the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm
       (most notably -quiet, see
        Common Options ⟨index.html#commonoptions⟩ ), pambayer  recognizes  the
       following command line options:

       -type=n
              This tells which Bayer pattern the input is:

       1      GBG/RGR/GBG matrix

       2      RGR/GBG/RGR matrix

       3      BGB/GRG/BGB matrix

       4      GRG/BGB/GRG matrix

              This option is mandatory.

       -nointerpolate
              Each  output  pixel  position corresponds to one position in the
              input Bayer pattern, which means only one  of  the  three  color
              components  is  supplied  by the input.  For the other two, this
              option says to user zero.  Without it, pambayer instead interpo‐
              lates  from  the  adjacent pixels that do have that color compo‐
              nent.

              This option was new in Netpbm 10.49 (December 2009).
