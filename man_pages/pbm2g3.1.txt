NAME

pbm2g3 -
convert portable bitmaps (PBM) into G3 fax files

SYNOPSIS

pbm2g3
[-r] [-wwidth>]
[-hlines>] [-d] [-a]
[pbmfile]

DESCRIPTION

Reads a
portable bitmap as input, converting it into a G3 fax file
on stdout. That file is suitable for faxing it with
sendfax(8) or queueing it for faxing with faxspool(1)
(provided that it gets a &rsquo;&rsquo;.g3&rsquo;&rsquo;
suffix).

faxspool(1)
uses pbm2g3(1) internally to convert various bitmap formats
into fax g3 format.

OPTIONS

-a

byte-aligns the end-of-line
codes, inserting padding bits as necessary.

-w 

sets the width of the resulting
G3 page. Default is 1728. If you want to be able to fax it
with sendfax, don&rsquo;t use anything else. For other fax
programs, 2048, 2432, 864 and 1216 may be useful. For other
purposes, use what you like.

If you set it
to 0, the width of the pbm file will be used.

-h 

specifies the number of blank
lines pbm2g3 should prepend to each page. Default is
0.

To produce
identical output as pbmplus&rsquo; pbm2g3 program (with my
patch!) does, use &rsquo;&rsquo;-h 4&rsquo;&rsquo;.

-r

reverse the bit order in the bytes.

-d

will one day make pbm2g3 prepend a digifax header to the
page. 

REFERENCES

The standard
for Group 3 fax is defined in CCITT Recommendation T.4.

BUGS

The -d option
isn&rsquo;t implemented yet.

If a raw pbm
file is converted, and the width of the g3 file is smaller
than the width of the pbm file, the former is rounded up to
the next multiple of 8.
