NAME
       ppmrelief - compute a relief of a PPM image

SYNOPSIS
       ppmrelief

       [ppmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       ppmrelief reads a PPM image as input, and writes a relief of that image
       as a PPM image as output.

       The relief process is described in "Beyond  Photography"  by  Holzmann,
       equation 3.19.  It's a sort of edge-detection and is essentially a con‐
       volution with this matrix:

           |  1  0  0 |
           |  0  0  0 |
           |  0  0 -1 |

OPTIONS
       There are no command line options defined specifically  for  ppmrelief,
       but it recognizes the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm
       (See
        Common Options ⟨index.html#commonoptions⟩ .)
