UKBD(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual UKBD(4)

NAME

ukbd &mdash; USB keyboard
driver

SYNOPSIS

To compile this driver into the
kernel, place the following line in your kernel
configuration file:

device
ukbd

Alternatively,
to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following line in loader.conf(5):

ukbd_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION

The ukbd driver provides
support for keyboards that attach to the USB port. usb(4)
and one of uhci(4) or ohci(4) must be configured in the
kernel as well.

CONFIGURATION

By default, the keyboard
subsystem does not create the appropriate devices yet. Make
sure you reconfigure your kernel with the following option
in the kernel config file:

options
KBD_INSTALL_CDEV

If both an AT
keyboard USB keyboards are used at the same time, the AT
keyboard will appear as kbd0 in /dev. The USB
keyboards will be kbd1, kbd2, etc. You can see
some information about the keyboard with the following
command:

kbdcontrol -i

or load a keymap
with

kbdcontrol -l
keymaps/pt.iso 

See
kbdcontrol(1) for more possible options.

You can swap
console keyboards by using the command

kbdcontrol -k
/dev/kbd1

From this point
on, the first USB keyboard will be the keyboard to be used
by the console.

If you want to
use a USB keyboard as your default and not use an AT
keyboard at all, you will have to remove the device
atkbd line from the kernel configuration file. Because
of the device initialization order, the USB keyboard will be
detected after the console driver initializes itself
and you have to explicitly tell the console driver to use
the existence of the USB keyboard. This can be done in one
of the following two ways.

Run the
following command as a part of system initialization:

kbdcontrol -k
/dev/kbd0  /dev/null

(Note that as
the USB keyboard is the only keyboard, it is accessed as
/dev/kbd0) or otherwise tell the console driver to
periodically look for a keyboard by setting a flag in the
kernel configuration file:

device sc0 at
isa? flags 0x100

With the above
flag, the console driver will try to detect any keyboard in
the system if it did not detect one while it was initialized
at boot time.

DRIVER CONFIGURATION

options
KBD_INSTALL_CDEV

Make the
keyboards available through a character device in
/dev.

options
UKBD_DFLT_KEYMAP 
makeoptions UKBD_DFLT_KEYMAP=fr.iso

The above lines
will put the French ISO keymap in the ukbd driver. You can
specify any keymap in /usr/share/syscons/keymaps or
/usr/share/vt/keymaps (depending on the console
driver being used) with this option.

options
KBD_DISABLE_KEYMAP_LOADING

Do not allow the
user to change the keymap. Note that these options also
affect the AT keyboard driver, atkbd(4).

SYSCTL VARIABLES

The following variables are
available as both sysctl(8) variables and loader(8)
tunables:

hw.usb.ukbd.debug

Debug output level, where 0 is
debugging disabled and larger values increase debug message
verbosity. Default is 0.

FILES 
/dev/kbd*

blocking device
nodes

EXAMPLES

device ukbd

Add the
ukbd driver to the kernel.
