dict - DICT
Protocol Client

SYNOPSIS

dict
word 
dict [options] [word] 
dict [options] dict://host:port/d:word:database

dict [options]
dict://host:port/m:word:database:strategy

DESCRIPTION

dict
is a client for the Dictionary Server Protocol (DICT), a TCP
transaction based query/response protocol that provides
access to dictionary definitions from a set of natural
language dictionary databases. Exit status is 0 if operation
succeeded, or non-zero otherwise. 
See EXIT STATUS section.

OPTIONS

-h
server or --host server

Specifies the hostname for the
DICT server. Server/port combinations can be specified in
the configuration file. If no servers are specified in the
configuration file or on the command line, dict will
fail. If IP lookup for a server expands to a list of IP
addresses (as dict.org does currently), then each IP will be
tried in the order listed.

-p service or
--port service

Specifies the port (e.g., 2628)
or service (e.g., dict) for connections. The default is
2628, as specified in the DICT Protocol RFC. Server/port
combinations can be specified in the configuration file.

-d dbname or
--database dbname

Specifies a specific database
to search. The default is to search all databases (a
"*" from the DICT protocol). Note that a
"!" in the DICT protocol means to search all of
the databases until a match is found, and then stop
searching.

-m or --match

Instead of printing a
definition, perform a match using the specified
strategy.

-s strategy or
--strategy strategy

Specify a matching strategy. By
default, the server default match strategy is used. This is
usually "exact" for definitions, and some form of
spelling-correction strategy for matches ("." from
the DICT protocol). The available strategies are dependent
on the server implementation. For a list of available
strategies, see the -S or --strats option.

-C or
--nocorrect

Usually, if a definition is
requested and the word cannot be found, spelling correction
is requested from the server, and a list of possible words
are provided. This option disables the generation of this
list.

-c file or
--config file

Specify the configuration file.
The default is to try ~/.dictrc and
/etc/dictd/dict.conf, using the first file that
exists. If a specific configuration file is specified, then
the defaults will not be tried.

-D or --dbs

Query the server and display a
list of available databases.

-S or
--strats

Query the server and display a
list of available search strategies.

-H or
--serverhelp

Query the server and display
the help information that it provides.

-i dbname or
--info dbname

Request information on the
specified database (usually the server will provide
origination, descriptive, or other information about the
database or its contents).

-I or
--serverinfo

Query the server and display
information about the server.

-M or --mime

Send OPTION MIME command
to the server. 
NOTE: Server&rsquo;s capabilities are not checked.

-f or
--formatted

Enables formatted output, i.e.
output convenient for postprocessing by standard UNIX
utilities. No, it is not XML ;-) Also error and warning
messages like 
" No matches...", " Invalid strategy..."
etc. are sent to stderr, not to stdout. 
Format: 
-I, -i, -H and similar: 
hostport 
line1 
line2 
... 
-S: 
hostportstrategy1short
description1 
hostportstrategy2short
description2 
... 
-D: 
hostportdatabase1database
description1 
hostportdatabase2database
description2 
... 
-m: 
hostportdatabase1match1

hostportdatabase2match2

...

-a or
--noauth

Disable authentication (i.e.,
don&rsquo;t send an AUTH command).

-u user or
--user user

Specifies the username for
authentication.

-k key or
--key key

Specifies the shared secret for
authentication.

-V or
--version

Display version
information.

-L or
--license

Display copyright and license
information.

-4

Forces dict to use IPv4 addresses only.

-6

Forces dict to use IPv6 addresses only.

--help

Display help information.

-v or
--verbose

Be verbose.

-r or --raw

Be very verbose: show the raw
client/server interaction.

--pipesize

Specify the buffer size for
pipelineing commands. The default is 256, which should be
sufficient for general tasks and be below the MTU for most
transport media. Larger values may provide faster or slower
throughput, depending on MTU. If the buffer is too small,
requests will be serialized. Values less than 0 and greater
than one million are silently changed to something more
reasonable.

--client text

Specifies additional text to be
sent using the CLIENT command.

--debug flag

Set a debugging flag. Valid
flags are: 
verbose

The same as -v or
--verbose.

raw

The same as -r or --raw.

scan

Debug the scanner for the configuration file.

parse

Debug the parser for the configuration file.

pipe

Debug TCP pipelining support (see the DICT RFC and
RFC1854). 

serial

Disable pipelining support.

time

Perform transaction timing.

CONFIGURATION

The
configuration file currently has a very simple format. Lines
are used to specify servers, for example:

server dict.org

or, with options:

server dict.org { port 8080 }

server dict.org { user username secret } 
server dict.org { port dict user username secret }

the port and user
options may be specified in any order. The port
option is used to specify an optional port (e.g., 2628) or
service (e.g., dict) for the TCP/IP connection. The
user option is used to specify a username and shared
secret to be used for authentication to this particular
server.

Servers are
tried in the order listed until a connection is made.

BUGS

If a
dict: URL is given on the command line, only the
first one is used. The rest are ignored.

If a
dict: URL contains a specifier for the nth definition
or match of a word, it will be ignored and all the
definitions or matches will be provided. This violates the
RFC, and will be corrected in a future release.

If a
dict: URL contains a shared secret, it will not be
parsed correctly.

When OPTION
MIME command is sent to the server (-M option) ,
server&rsquo;s capabilities are not checked.
