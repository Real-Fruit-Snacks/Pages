NAME

posix_spawnattr_getschedparam,
posix_spawnattr_setschedparam &mdash; get and set the
spawn-schedparam attribute of a spawn attributes object
(ADVANCED REALTIME)

SYNOPSIS

#include

#include 

int
posix_spawnattr_getschedparam(const posix_spawnattr_t 
*restrict attr, struct sched_param *restrict
schedparam); 
int posix_spawnattr_setschedparam(posix_spawnattr_t
*restrict attr, 
const struct sched_param *restrict schedparam);

DESCRIPTION

The
posix_spawnattr_getschedparam() function shall obtain
the value of the spawn-schedparam attribute from the
attributes object referenced by attr.

The
posix_spawnattr_setschedparam() function shall set
the spawn-schedparam attribute in an initialized
attributes object referenced by attr.

The
spawn-schedparam attribute represents the scheduling
parameters to be assigned to the new process image in a
spawn operation (if POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDULER or
POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDPARAM is set in the spawn-flags
attribute). The default value of this attribute is
unspecified.

RETURN VALUE

Upon successful
completion, posix_spawnattr_getschedparam() shall
return zero and store the value of the
spawn-schedparam attribute of attr into the
object referenced by the schedparam parameter;
otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the
error.

Upon successful
completion, posix_spawnattr_setschedparam() shall
return zero; otherwise, an error number shall be returned to
indicate the error.

ERRORS

These functions
may fail if:

EINVAL

The value specified by attr is invalid.

The
posix_spawnattr_setschedparam() function may fail
if:

EINVAL

The value of the attribute being
set is not valid.

The
following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES

None.

APPLICATION USAGE

These functions
are part of the Spawn and Process Scheduling options and
need not be provided on all implementations.

RATIONALE

None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS

None.
