PPPOED(8)

NAME

pppoed — handle
incoming PPP over Ethernet connections

SYNOPSIS

pppoed
[−Fd] [−P pidfile]
[−a name]
[−e exec | −l label]
[−n ngdebug]
[−p provider] interface

DESCRIPTION

The pppoed utility
listens to the given interface for PPP over Ethernet
(PPPoE) service request packets, and actions them by
negotiating a session then invoking a ppp(8) program. The
negotiation is implemented by the
’’pppoe’’ netgraph node. See
ng_pppoe(4) for details.

The
pppoed utility will only offer services to clients
requesting services from the given provider, which is
taken as an empty name if not provided. If a provider name
of ’’*’’ is given, any PPPoE
requests will be offered service.

The supplied
name will be given as the access concentrator name
when establishing the connection. If no name is
given, the current base hostname is used.

After receiving
a request (PADI) from the PPPoE netgraph node, pppoed
fork(2)s a child process and returns to service further
requests. The child process offers service (using
name) and waits for a SUCCESS indication from the
PPPoE node. On receipt of the SUCCESS indication,
pppoed will execute

exec
/usr/sbin/ppp −direct label

as a shell
sub-process. If label has not been specified, it
defaults to provider. It is possible to specify
another command using the exec argument. This is
mandatory if provider and label are not given.
The child process will have standard input and standard
output attached to the same netgraph(4) data socket (see
ng_socket(4)) when started.

The environment
variables HISMACADDR and ACNAME are made available to the
child process and are set to the MAC address of the peer and
the name of the AC respectively.

Upon invocation,
pppoed will attach a
’’pppoe’’ netgraph node to the
relevant ’’ether’’ node using
’’interface:’’ as the node
name, and then connect that
’’pppoe’’ node to a local
’’socket’’ node. If the
−F option has not been given, pppoed
will then go into the background and disassociate itself
from the controlling terminal. When the −F
option is given, pppoed stays in the foreground.

If the
−d option is given, additional diagnostics are
provided (see the DIAGNOSTICS section below). If the
−n option is given, NgSetDebug() is
called with an argument of ngdebug.

If
pidfile is given, pppoed will write its
process ID to this file on startup.

DIAGNOSTICS

After creating the necessary
netgraph(4) nodes as described above, pppoed uses
syslogd(8) to report all incoming connections. If the
−d option is given, pppoed will report
on the child processes creation of a new netgraph socket,
it’s service offer and the invocation of the ppp(8)
program. If the −n option is given, netgraph
diagnostic messages are also redirected to syslogd(8).

It is sometimes
useful to add the following to /etc/syslog.conf:

!pppoed

*.*

/var/log/pppoed.log

and the
following to /etc/newsyslog.conf:

/var/log/pppoed.log

640 3

100

* Z

BUGS

If another netgraph node is
using the given interface, pppoed will fail to start.
This is because netgraph(4) does not currently allow node
chaining. This may change in the future.

HISTORY

The pppoed utility was
written by Brian Somers brian [AT] Awfulhak.org> and first
appeared in FreeBSD 3.4.
