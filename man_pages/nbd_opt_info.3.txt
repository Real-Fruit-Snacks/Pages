NAME

nbd_opt_info -
request the server for information about an export

SYNOPSIS

#include

int nbd_opt_info ( 
struct nbd_handle *h 
);

DESCRIPTION

Request that
the server supply information about the export name
previously specified by the most recent
nbd_set_export_name(3) or nbd_connect_uri(3).
This can only be used if nbd_set_opt_mode(3) enabled
option mode.

If successful,
functions like nbd_is_read_only(3) and
nbd_get_size(3) will report details about that
export. If nbd_set_request_meta_context(3) is set
(the default) and structured replies or extended headers
were negotiated, it is also valid to use
nbd_can_meta_context(3) after this call. However, it
may be more efficient to clear that setting and manually
utilize nbd_opt_list_meta_context(3) with its
callback approach, for learning which contexts an export
supports. In general, if nbd_opt_go(3) is called
next, that call will likely succeed with the details
remaining the same, although this is not guaranteed by all
servers.

Not all servers
understand this request, and even when it is understood, the
server might fail the request even when a corresponding
nbd_opt_go(3) would succeed.

RETURN VALUE

If the call is
successful the function returns 0.

ERRORS

On error -1 is
returned.

Refer to
"ERROR HANDLING" in libnbd(3) for how to
get further details of the error.

The following
parameters must not be NULL: "h". For more
information see "Non-NULL parameters" in
