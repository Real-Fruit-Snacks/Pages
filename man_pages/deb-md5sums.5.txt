deb-md5sums(5)                    dpkg suite                    deb-md5sums(5)

NAME
       deb-md5sums - package MD5 file digests

SYNOPSIS
       DEBIAN/md5sums

DESCRIPTION
       A package declares the MD5 digests for the package file contents by
       including an md5sums file in its control archive (i.e. DEBIAN/md5sums
       during package creation). This file is used for integrity verification
       and deduplication purposes, and not for any kind of security purpose.

       This file contains a list of MD5 digests (as 32 case-insensitive
       hexadecimal characters) followed by two spaces (U+0020 SPACE) and the
       absolute pathname of a plain file, one per line.

       Trailing slashes (U+002F /) in the pathname will be trimmed.  Neither
       trailing whitespace nor empty or whitespace-only lines are accepted.

       If the control file does not exist in the binary package, dpkg(1) will
       generate the matching information at unpack time (since dpkg 1.16.3).
