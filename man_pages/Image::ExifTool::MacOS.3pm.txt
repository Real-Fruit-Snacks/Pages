NAME
       Image::ExifTool::MacOS - Read/write MacOS system tags

SYNOPSIS
       This module is used by Image::ExifTool

DESCRIPTION
       This module contains definitions required by Image::ExifTool to extract
       MDItem* and XAttr* tags on MacOS systems using the "mdls" and "xattr"
       utilities respectively.  It also reads metadata directly from the MacOS
       "_."  sidecar files that are used on some filesystems to store file
       attributes.  Writable tags use "xattr", "setfile" or "osascript" for
       writing.
