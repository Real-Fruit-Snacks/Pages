NAME

mkcat âˆ’
create a new GNATS category

SYNOPSIS

mkcat

[
-d databasename |
--database=databasename ]

[ -h | --help
]

DESCRIPTION

Scans the
database for any new categories, creating new subdirectories
in the database directory if any are found.

This program is
mostly obsolete since directories for categories are
automatically created as necessary, but is left for
histerical reasons.

mkcat should be
run by the GNATS user (by default gnats).

OPTIONS

-d,
--database

Specifies the database to be
scanned for new categories; if no database is specified, the
database named default is assumed. This option
overrides the database specified in the GNATSDB
environment variable.

-h, --help

Displays a short usage
message.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

The
GNATSDB environment variable is used to determine
which database to use. For a local database, it contains the
name of the database to access. If GNATSDB is not
set, the database named default is used.
