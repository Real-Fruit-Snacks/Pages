mmv_inc_value, mmv_inc_atomvalue - update a
value in a Memory Mapped Value file

*av, double inc);

*av, pmAtomValue *inc);

DESCRIPTION

mmv_inc_value
and mmv_inc_atomvalue provide convenient ways of
updating a metric av previously returned by the
mmv_lookup_value_desc(3) interface. addr is
the address returned from mmv_stats_init(3).

These
interfaces are most commonly used with counter type metrics.
Refer to mmv_set_value(3) for a mechanism suited to
instantaneous and discrete metrics.

With
mmv_inc_atomvalue the value provided via the
inc pointer must match the type of the metric, and
will be added to the previous value of the metric.

In the case of
mmv_inc_value the value of inc is internally
cast to match the type of the metric and then added to the
previous value of the metric.
