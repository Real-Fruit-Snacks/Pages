NAME

vx &mdash; 3Com EtherLink
III / Fast EtherLink III (3c59x) Ethernet driver

SYNOPSIS

To compile this driver into the
kernel, place the following line in your kernel
configuration file:

device
vx

Alternatively,
to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following line in loader.conf(5):

if_vx_load="YES"

DEPRECATION NOTICE

The vx driver is not
present in FreeBSD 13.0 and later. See
https://github.com/freebsd/fcp/blob/master/fcp-0101.md for
more information.

DESCRIPTION

The vx driver provides
support for the 3Com &rsquo;&rsquo;Vortex&rsquo;&rsquo;
chipset.

The medium
selection can be influenced by the following link flags to
the ifconfig(8) command:

link0

Use the AUI
port.

link1

Use the BNC
port.

link2

Use the UTP
port.

HARDWARE

The vx driver supports
the following cards:

&bull;

3Com 3c590 EtherLink III
PCI

&bull;

3Com 3c595 Fast EtherLink III
PCI in 10 Mbps mode

DIAGNOSTICS

All other diagnostics indicate
either a hardware problem or a bug in the driver.

HISTORY

The vx device driver
first appeared in FreeBSD 2.1. It was derived from the
ep driver, from which it inherits most of its
limitations.

AUTHORS

The vx device driver and
this manual page were written by Fred Gray
fgray [AT] rice.edu>, based on the work of Herb
Peyerl and with the assistance of numerous others.

CAVEATS

Some early-revision 3c590 cards
are defective and suffer from many receive overruns, which
cause lost packets. The author has attempted to implement a
test for it based on the information supplied by 3Com, but
the test resulted mostly in spurious warnings.

The performance
of this driver is somewhat limited by the fact that it uses
only polled-mode I/O and does not make use of the
bus-mastering capability of the cards.

BUGS

The vx driver is known
not to reset the adapter correctly following a warm boot on
some systems.

The vx
driver has not been exhaustively tested with all the models
of cards that it claims to support.
