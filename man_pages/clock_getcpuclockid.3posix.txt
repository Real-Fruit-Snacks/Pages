CLOCK_GETCPUCLOCKID(3POSIX)POSIX Programmer's ManuaCLOCK_GETCPUCLOCKID(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       clock_getcpuclockid — access a process CPU-time clock  (ADVANCED  REAL‐
       TIME)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <time.h>

       int clock_getcpuclockid(pid_t pid, clockid_t *clock_id);

DESCRIPTION
       The  clock_getcpuclockid()  function  shall  return the clock ID of the
       CPU-time clock of the process specified by pid.   If  the  process  de‐
       scribed by pid exists and the calling process has permission, the clock
       ID of this clock shall be returned in clock_id.

       If pid is zero, the clock_getcpuclockid()  function  shall  return  the
       clock  ID  of  the  CPU-time  clock  of the process making the call, in
       clock_id.

       The conditions under which one process has  permission  to  obtain  the
       CPU-time clock ID of other processes are implementation-defined.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon  successful  completion,  clock_getcpuclockid() shall return zero;
       otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The clock_getcpuclockid() function shall fail if:

       EPERM  The requesting process does not have permission  to  access  the
              CPU-time clock for the process.

       The clock_getcpuclockid() function may fail if:

       ESRCH  No  process  can be found corresponding to the process specified
              by pid.

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       The clock_getcpuclockid() function is  part  of  the  Process  CPU-Time
       Clocks option and need not be provided on all implementations.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
