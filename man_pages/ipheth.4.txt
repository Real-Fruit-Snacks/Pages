DESCRIPTION

The ipheth driver
provides support for network access through Apple iPhone and
iPad devices, often referred to as USB tethering.

ipheth
should work with any Apple iPhone or iPad device. In most
cases this must be explicitly enabled on the device
first.

For more
information on configuring this device, see ifconfig(8). The
device does not support different media types or
options.

supported by the ipheth driver:

&bull;

Apple iPhone tethering (all

Apple iPad tethering (all

HISTORY

The ipheth device driver
first appeared in FreeBSD 8.2.

AUTHORS

written by Hans Petter Selasky

BUGS

Some devices may need to be
manually configured to use an alternative configuration with
the usbconfig(8) utility. A command similar to

usbconfig -u 1 -a 2 set_config
3

may be required if the device is
not recognised automatically by ipheth after it is
connected.
