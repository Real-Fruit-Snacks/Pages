NAME
       pnmflip - replaced by pamflip

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       pnmflip was replaced in Netpbm 10.13 (December 2002) by pamflip(1).

       pamflip  is  mostly  backward compatible with pnmflip, but works on PAM
       images too.

       One way pamflip is not backward compatible with pnmflip is that pnmflip
       lets  you specify any number of basic flip options, whereas pamflip re‐
       quires exactly one.  (pamflip provides the -xform option for requesting
       multiple  transformations,  though).   Because of this incompatibility,
       pnmflip still exists as a separate program, and all it does  is  trans‐
       late its options to pamflip style and run pamflip.

       You  should not make any new use of pnmflip and if you modify an exist‐
       ing use, you should upgrade to pamflip.  But note that if you  write  a
       program that might have to be used with very old Netpbm, pnmflip is the
       only way to do that.
