NAME

moderators -
mail addresses for moderated Usenet newsgroups

DESCRIPTION

The
GetModeratorAddress(3) routine reads the file
/etc/news/moderators to determine how to reach the
moderator of a newsgroup. This is used by inews(1)
when an unapproved local posting is made to a moderated
newsgroup.

The file is
read until a match is found. Blank lines and lines starting
with a number sign (’’#’’) are
ignored. All other lines should consist of two fields
separated by a colon.

The first field
is a wildmat(3)-style pattern. If it matches the name
of the newsgroup, then the second field is taken to be a
format string for sprintf(3). This string should have
at most one %s parameter, which will be given the
name of the newsgroup with periods transliterated to
dashes.

Here is a
sample file:

foo.important:announce-request [AT] foo.com

foo.*:%s [AT] mailer.com 
gnu.*:%s [AT] prep.edu 
*:%s [AT] uunet.net

Using the above file, postings
to the moderated newsgroup in the left column will be sent
to the address shown in the right column:

foo.important
announce-request [AT] foo.com

foo.x.announce

foo-x-announce [AT] mailer.com

gnu.emacs.sources

gnu-emacs-sources [AT] prep.edu

comp.sources.unix

comp-sources-unix [AT] uunet.net
