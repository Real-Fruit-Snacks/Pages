NAME

secolor.conf -
The SELinux color configuration file

DESCRIPTION

This optional
file controls the color to be associated to the context
components associated to the raw context passed by
selinux_raw_context_to_color(3), when context related
information is to be displayed in color by an SELinux-aware
application.

selinux_raw_context_to_color(3)
obtains this color information from the active policy
secolor.conf file as returned by
selinux_colors_path(3).

FILE FORMAT

The file format
is as follows:

color color_name
= #color_mask 
[...]

context_component
string = fg_color_name bg_color_name 
[...]

Where: 
color

The color keyword. Each color
entry is on a new line.

color_name

A single word name for the
color (e.g. red).

color_mask

A color mask starting with a
hash (#) that describes the hexadecimal RGB colors with
black being #000000 and white being #ffffff.

context_component

The context component name that
must be one of the following:

user, role, type or range

Each context_component
string ... entry is on a new line.

string

This is the
context_component string that will be matched with
the raw context component passed by
selinux_raw_context_to_color(3). 
A wildcard ’*’ may be used to match any
undefined string for the user, role and type
context_component entries only.

fg_color_name

EXAMPLES

Example 1

color black = #000000 
color green = #008000 
color yellow = #ffff00 
color blue = #0000ff 
color white = #ffffff 
color red = #ff0000 
color orange = #ffa500 
color tan = #D2B48C

user * = black
white 
role * = white black 
type * = tan orange 
range s0-s0:c0.c1023 = black green 
range s1-s1:c0.c1023 = white green 
range s3-s3:c0.c1023 = black tan 
range s5-s5:c0.c1023 = white blue 
range s7-s7:c0.c1023 = black red 
range s9-s9:c0.c1023 = black orange 
range s15-s15:c0.c1023 = black yellow

Example 2
entries are:

color black = #000000

color white = #ffffff 
color red = #ff0000 
color orange = #ffa500 
color tan = #d2b48c

user
unconfined_u = #ff0000 green 
role unconfined_r = red #ffffff 
type unconfined_t = red orange 
user user_u = black green 
role user_r = white black 
type user_t = tan red 
user xguest_u = black yellow 
role xguest_r = black red 
type xguest_t = black green 
user sysadm_u = white black 
range s0-s0:c0.c1023 = black white 
user * = black white 
role * = black white 
type * = black white
