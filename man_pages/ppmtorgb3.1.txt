NAME
       ppmtorgb3 - separate a PPM image into three PGMs

SYNOPSIS
       ppmtorgb3

       [ppmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       ppmtorgb3  reads  a  PPM  image as input and writes three PGM images as
       output, one each for red, green, and blue.

       ppmtorgb3 constructs the output filenames by taking the input filename,
       stripping off any extension, and appending .red, .grn, .blu.  For exam‐
       ple, separating lenna.ppm would result  in  lenna.red,  lenna.grn,  and
       lenna.blu.   If  the  input comes from stdin, the names are noname.red,
       noname.grn, and noname.blu.

OPTIONS
       There are no command line options defined specifically  for  ppmtorgb3,
       but it recognizes the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm
       (See
        Common Options ⟨index.html#commonoptions⟩ .)
