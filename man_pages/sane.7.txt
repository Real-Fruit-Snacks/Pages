NAME
       sane - Scanner Access Now Easy: API for accessing scanners

DESCRIPTION
       SANE  is an application programming interface (API) that provides stan‐
       dardized access to any raster image scanner hardware. The  standardized
       interface  makes  it possible to write just one driver for each scanner
       device instead of one driver for each scanner and application.

       While SANE is primarily targeted at a UNIX  environment,  the  standard
       has been carefully designed to make it possible to implement the API on
       virtually any hardware or operating system.

       This manual page provides a summary of the information available  about
       SANE.

       If  you  have  trouble getting your scanner detected, read the PROBLEMS
       section.

TERMINOLOGY
       An application that uses the SANE interface is called a SANE  frontend.
       A  driver  that implements the SANE interface is called a SANE backend.
       A meta backend provides some means to manage one or  more  other  back‐
       ends.

SOFTWARE PACKAGES
       The  package sane-backends contains backends, documentation, networking
       support, and the command line frontend scanimage(1).  The frontends xs‐
       canimage(1),  xcam(1),  and  scanadf(1)  are  included  in  the package
       sane-frontends.  Both packages can be downloaded from the SANE homepage
       (http://www.sane-project.org/).   Information about other frontends and
       backends can also be found on the SANE homepage.

GENERAL INFORMATION
       The following sections provide short descriptions and links to more in‐
       formation  about  several  aspects  of  SANE.   A name with a number in
       parenthesis (e.g.  sane-dll(5)) points to a manual page. In  this  case
       man 5 sane-dll  will display the page. Entries like /usr/share/doc/lib‐
       sane/README are references to text files that were copied to  the  SANE
       documentation  directory (/usr/share/doc/libsane/) during installation.
       Everything else is a URL to a resource on the web.

       SANE homepage
         Information on all aspects of SANE including a tutorial and a link to
         the    SANE    FAQ    can    be   found   on   the   SANE   homepage:
         http://www.sane-project.org/.

       SANE device lists
         The SANE device lists contain information about the  status  of  SANE
         support  for  a  specific device. If your scanner is not listed there
         (either supported or unsupported), please contact us. See section HOW
         CAN  YOU HELP SANE for details. There are lists for specific releases
         of SANE, for the current development version  and  a  search  engine:
         http://www.sane-project.org/sane-supported-devices.html.   The  lists
         are also installed on your system at /usr/share/doc/libsane/.

       SANE mailing list
         There is a mailing list for the purpose of discussing the SANE  stan‐
         dard and its implementations: sane-devel.  Despite its name, the list
         is not only intended for developers, but also for  users.  There  are
         also some more lists for special topics. However, for users, sane-de‐
         vel  is  the  right  list.  How   to   subscribe   and   unsubscribe:
         http://www.sane-project.org/mailing-lists.html.

       SANE IRC channel
         The  IRC  (Internet  Relay  Chat)  channel  #sane can be found on the
         Freenode network (irc.libera.chat). It's for  discussing  SANE  prob‐
         lems,  talking  about  development and general SANE related chatting.
         Before asking for help, please read the other documentation mentioned
         in  this  manual page. The channel's topic is also used for announce‐
         ments of  problems  with  SANE  infrastructure  (mailing  lists,  web
         server, etc.).

       Compiling and installing SANE
         Look  at  /usr/share/doc/libsane/README  and  the os-dependent README
         files for information about compiling and installing SANE.

MISCELLANEOUS BACKENDS
       dll
         Implements a SANE backend that provides access to an arbitrary number
         of other SANE backends by dynamic loading. See sane-dll(5).

       net
         The  SANE network daemon saned(8) provides access to scanners located
         on different computers in connection with  the  sane-net(5)  backend.
         See saned(8).

       pnm
         PNM  image reader pseudo-backend. The purpose of this backend is pri‐
         marily to aid in debugging of SANE frontends. See sane-pnm(5).

       pint
         Supports scanners that use  the  PINT  (Pint  Is  Not  Twain)  device
         driver.   The  PINT driver is being actively developed on the OpenBSD
         platform, and has been ported to a few other *NIX-like operating sys‐
         tems. See sane-pint(5).

       test
         Tests frontends and the SANE installation.  It provides test pictures
         and various test options. See sane-test(5).

       v4l
         Provides generic access to video cameras and similar equipment  using
         the V4L (Video for Linux) API. See sane-v4l(5).

       Also,    have   a   look   at   the   backend   information   page   at
       http://www.sane-project.org/sane-supported-devices.html and the list of
       projects in /usr/share/doc/libsane/PROJECTS.

CHANGING THE TOP-LEVEL BACKEND
       By  default,  all SANE backends (drivers) are loaded dynamically by the
       sane-dll meta backend. If you have  any  questions  about  the  dynamic
       loading,  read sane-dll(5).  SANE frontends can also be linked to other
       backends directly by copying or linking  a  backend  to  libsane.so  in
       /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane.

DEVELOPER'S DOCUMENTATION
       It's  not hard to write a SANE backend. It can take some time, however.
       You should have basic knowledge  of  C  and  enough  patience  to  work
       through the documentation and find out how your scanner works. Appended
       is a list of some documents that help to write backends and frontends.

       The SANE standard defines the application programming  interface  (API)
       that  is  used to communicate between frontends and backends. It can be
       found at http://sane-project.gitlab.io/standard/ .

       There is some more information for programmers  in  /usr/share/doc/lib‐
       sane/backend-writing.txt.   Most  of the internal SANE routines (sanei)
       are documented using doxygen: http://www.sane-project.org/sanei/.   Be‐
       fore  a  new  backend  or  frontend  project is started, have a look at
       /usr/share/doc/libsane/PROJECTS for projects that are  planned  or  not
       yet included into the SANE distribution and at our bug-tracking system:
       http://www.http://www.sane-project.org/bugs.html.

       There are some links on how to find out about the protocol of  a  scan‐
       ner: http://www.meier-geinitz.de/sane/misc/develop.html.

       If  you  start writing a backend or frontend or any other part of SANE,
       please contact the sane-devel mailing list  for  coordination  so  that
       work is not duplicated.

FILES
       /etc/sane.d/*.conf

PROBLEMS
       If your device isn't found but you know that it is supported, make sure
       that  it  is  detected by your operating system. For SCSI and USB scan‐
       ners, use the sane-find-scanner(1) utility.  It  prints  one  line  for
       each scanner it has detected and some comments (#).  If sane-find-scan‐
       ner(1) finds your scanner only as root but not as normal user, the per‐
       missions  for the device files are not adjusted correctly. If the scan‐
       ner isn't found at all, the operating system hasn't detected it and may
       need some help. Depending on the type of your scanner, read sane-usb(5)
       or sane-scsi(5).  If your scanner (or other device)  is  not  connected
       over the SCSI bus or USB, read the backend's manual page for details on
       how to set it up.

       Is your scanner detected by the operating system but not by SANE?   Try
       scanimage -L.   If  the  scanner is not found, check that the backend's
       name is mentioned in /etc/sane.d/dll.conf.  Some backends are commented
       out  by default. Remove the comment sign for your backend in this case.
       Also some backends aren't compiled at all if one of their prerequisites
       are  missing. Examples include dc210, dc240, canon_pp, hpsj5s, gphoto2,
       pint, qcam, v4l, net, sm3600, snapscan, pnm. If you need one  of  these
       backends  and  it  isn't  available, read the build instructions in the
       README file and the individual manual pages of the backends.

       Another reason for not being detected by scanimage -L may be a  missing
       or  incorrect  configuration in the backend's configuration file. While
       SANE tries to automatically find most scanners,  some  can't  be  setup
       correctly  without  the intervention of the administrator. Also on some
       operating systems auto-detection may not work. Check the backend's man‐
       ual page for details.

       If your scanner is still not found, try setting the various environment
       variables that are available to assist in debugging.   The  environment
       variables are documented in the relevant manual pages.  For example, to
       get the maximum amount of debug information when testing a Mustek  SCSI
       scanner,  set  environment variables SANE_DEBUG_DLL, SANE_DEBUG_MUSTEK,
       and SANE_DEBUG_SANEI_SCSI to 128 and  then  invoke  scanimage -L.   The
       SANE_DEBUG_DLL  messages  tell  if the sane-mustek(5) backend was found
       and loaded at all. The  SANE_DEBUG_MUSTEK  messages  explain  what  the
       backend  is  doing  while  the  SANE_DEBUG_SCSI debugging shows the low
       level handling. If you can't find out what's going on by  checking  the
       messages  carefully,  contact the sane-devel mailing list for help (see
       REPORTING BUGS below).

       Now that your scanner is found by scanimage -L, try to do a scan: scan‐
       image >image.pnm.   This  command starts a scan for the default scanner
       with default settings. All the available options are listed by  running
       scanimage --help.   If  scanning  aborts with an error message, turn on
       debugging as mentioned above. Maybe the configuration file  needs  some
       tuning,  e.g.  to  setup  the path to a firmware that is needed by some
       scanners. See the backend's manual page for details. If you can't  find
       out what's wrong, contact sane-devel.

       To  check  that  the SANE libraries are installed correctly you can use
       the test backend, even if you don't have a scanner or  other  SANE  de‐
       vice:

              scanimage -d test -T

       You  should  get  a list of PASSed tests. You can do the same with your
       backend by changing "test" to your backend's name.

       So now scanning with scanimage (1) works and you want to use one of the
       graphical  frontends  like  xsane(1), xscanimage(1), or quiteinsane (1)
       but those frontends don't detect your scanner? One reason may  be  that
       you  installed  two  versions  of  SANE.  E.g. the version that was in‐
       stalled by your distribution in /usr and one you installed from  source
       in  /usr/local/.  Make sure that only one version is installed. Another
       possible reason is, that your system's dynamic loader  can't  find  the
       SANE  libraries.  For  Linux,  make  sure that /etc/ld.so.conf contains
       /usr/local/lib and does not contain /usr/local/lib/sane.  See also  the
       documentation of the frontends.
