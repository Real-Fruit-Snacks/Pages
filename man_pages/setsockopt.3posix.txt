SETSOCKOPT(3POSIX)         POSIX Programmer's Manual        SETSOCKOPT(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       setsockopt — set the socket options

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/socket.h>

       int setsockopt(int socket, int level, int option_name,
           const void *option_value, socklen_t option_len);

DESCRIPTION
       The setsockopt() function shall set the option  specified  by  the  op‐
       tion_name  argument, at the protocol level specified by the level argu‐
       ment, to the value pointed to by  the  option_value  argument  for  the
       socket  associated with the file descriptor specified by the socket ar‐
       gument.

       The level argument specifies the protocol level at which the option re‐
       sides.  To  set options at the socket level, specify the level argument
       as SOL_SOCKET. To set options at other levels, supply  the  appropriate
       level  identifier for the protocol controlling the option. For example,
       to indicate that an option is interpreted by the TCP (Transport Control
       Protocol),  set  level  to IPPROTO_TCP as defined in the <netinet/in.h>
       header.

       The option_name argument specifies a single option to set.  It  can  be
       one of the socket-level options defined in <sys_socket.h> and described
       in Section 2.10.16, Use of Options.  If option_name is equal to SO_RCV‐
       TIMEO  or  SO_SNDTIMEO  and the implementation supports setting the op‐
       tion, it is unspecified whether the struct timeval pointed  to  by  op‐
       tion_value  is  stored as provided by this function or is rounded up to
       align with the resolution of the clock being used. If  setsockopt()  is
       called  with  option_name equal to SO_ACCEPTCONN, SO_ERROR, or SO_TYPE,
       the behavior is unspecified.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, setsockopt() shall return 0. Otherwise,  -1
       shall be returned and errno set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The setsockopt() function shall fail if:

       EBADF  The socket argument is not a valid file descriptor.

       EDOM   The  send and receive timeout values are too big to fit into the
              timeout fields in the socket structure.

       EINVAL The specified option is invalid at the specified socket level or
              the socket has been shut down.

       EISCONN
              The  socket  is already connected, and a specified option cannot
              be set while the socket is connected.

       ENOPROTOOPT
              The option is not supported by the protocol.

       ENOTSOCK
              The socket argument does not refer to a socket.

       The setsockopt() function may fail if:

       ENOMEM There was insufficient memory available  for  the  operation  to
              complete.

       ENOBUFS
              Insufficient  resources  are available in the system to complete
              the call.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       The setsockopt() function provides  an  application  program  with  the
       means  to  control socket behavior. An application program can use set‐
       sockopt() to allocate buffer space, control timeouts, or permit  socket
       data broadcasts. The <sys/socket.h> header defines the socket-level op‐
       tions available to setsockopt().

       Options may exist at multiple protocol levels. The SO_ options are  al‐
       ways present at the uppermost socket level.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
