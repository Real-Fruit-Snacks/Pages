ISFINITE(3POSIX)           POSIX Programmer's Manual          ISFINITE(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       isfinite — test for finite value

SYNOPSIS
       #include <math.h>

       int isfinite(real-floating x);

DESCRIPTION
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with  the
       ISO C  standard.  Any  conflict between the requirements described here
       and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017
       defers to the ISO C standard.

       The  isfinite() macro shall determine whether its argument has a finite
       value (zero, subnormal, or normal, and not infinite or NaN). First,  an
       argument  represented  in a format wider than its semantic type is con‐
       verted to its semantic type. Then determination is based on the type of
       the argument.

RETURN VALUE
       The  isfinite()  macro shall return a non-zero value if and only if its
       argument has a finite value.

ERRORS
       No errors are defined.
