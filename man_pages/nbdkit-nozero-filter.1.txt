NAME

nbdkit-nozero-filter
- nbdkit nozero filter

SYNOPSIS

nbdkit
--filter=nozero plugin [plugin-args...] \ 
[zeromode=MODE] [fastzeromode=MODE]

DESCRIPTION

"nbdkit-nozero-filter"
is a filter that intentionally disables efficient handling
of sparse file holes (ranges of all-zero bytes) across the
NBD protocol. It is mainly useful for evaluating timing
differences between naive vs. sparse-aware connections, and
for testing client or server fallbacks.

PARAMETERS

The parameters
"zeromode" and "fastzeromode" are
optional and control which mode the filter will use. 
zeromode=none

Zero support is not advertised
to the client; clients must explicitly write any regions of
zero like any other normal write.

This is the
default if the "zeromode" parameter is not
specified.

zeromode=emulate

Zero support is advertised, but
emulated by the filter by using the plugin&rsquo;s
"pwrite" callback, regardless of whether the
plugin itself has a more efficient "zero"
callback.

zeromode=notrim

(nbdkit &ge; 1.14)

Zero requests
are forwarded on to the plugin, except that the plugin will
never see the "NBDKIT_MAY_TRIM" flag. This can
help determine if the client permitting trimming during zero
operations makes a difference. It is an error to request
this mode if the plugin lacks the "zero"
callback.

zeromode=plugin

(nbdkit &ge; 1.16)

Zero requests
are forwarded on to the plugin, unchanged by the filter;
this mode is helpful when experimenting with the
"fastzeromode" parameter. It is an error to
request this mode if the plugin lacks the "zero"
callback.

fastzeromode=none

(nbdkit &ge; 1.16)

Support for
fast zeroing is not advertised to the client.

fastzeromode=slow

(nbdkit &ge; 1.16)

Fast zero
support is advertised to the client, but all fast zero
requests result in an immediate "ENOTSUP" failure
rather than performing any fallback attempts.

fastzeromode=ignore

(nbdkit &ge; 1.16)

This mode is
unsafe: Fast zero support is advertised to the client,
but all fast zero requests behave as if the fast zero flag
had not been included. This behavior is typically contrary
to the NBD specification, but can be useful for comparison
against the actual fast zero implementation to see if fast
zeroes make a difference.

fastzeromode=default

(nbdkit &ge; 1.16)

This mode is
the default. When paired with "zeromode=emulate",
fast zeroes are advertised but fast zero requests always
fail (similar to "slow"); when paired with
"zeromode=notrim" or "zeromode=plugin",
fast zero support is left to the plugin (although in the
latter case, the nozero filter could be omitted for the same
behavior).

EXAMPLES

Serve the file
disk.img, but force the client to write zeroes
explicitly rather than with
"NBD_CMD_WRITE_ZEROES":

nbdkit
--filter=nozero file disk.img

Serve the file
disk.img, allowing the client to take advantage of
less network traffic via "NBD_CMD_WRITE_ZEROES",
but fail any fast zero requests up front and force all other
zero requests to write data explicitly rather than punching
any holes:

nbdkit
--filter=nozero file zeromode=emulate disk.img

Serve the file
disk.img, but do not advertise fast zero support to
the client even if the plugin supports it:

nbdkit
--filter=nozero file zeromode=plugin fastzeromode=none
disk.img
