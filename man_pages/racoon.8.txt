NAME

racoon &mdash; IKE
(ISAKMP/Oakley) key management daemon

SYNOPSIS

racoon
[&minus;46BdFLVv]
[&minus;f configfile]
[&minus;l logfile]
[&minus;P isakmp-natt-port]
[&minus;p isakmp-port]

DESCRIPTION

racoon speaks the IKE
(ISAKMP/Oakley) key management protocol, to establish
security associations with other hosts. The SPD (Security
Policy Database) in the kernel usually triggers
racoon. racoon usually sends all informational
messages, warnings and error messages to syslogd(8) with the
facility LOG_DAEMON and the priority LOG_INFO. Debugging
messages are sent with the priority LOG_DEBUG. You should
configure syslog.conf(5) appropriately to see these
messages.

&minus;4 
&minus;6

Specify the
default address family for the sockets.

&minus;B

Install SA(s)
from the file which is specified in racoon.conf(5).

&minus;d

Increase the
debug level. Multiple &minus;d arguments will
increase the debug level even more.

&minus;F

Run
racoon in the foreground.

&minus;f
configfile

Use configfile as the
configuration file instead of the default.

&minus;L

Include
file_name:line_number:function_name in all
messages.

&minus;l
logfile

Use logfile as the
logging file instead of syslogd(8).

&minus;P
isakmp-natt-port

Use isakmp-natt-port for
NAT-Traversal port-floating. The default is 4500.

&minus;p
isakmp-port

Listen to the ISAKMP key
exchange on port isakmp-port instead of the default
port number, 500.

&minus;V

Print racoon
version and compilation options and exit.

&minus;v

This flag
causes the packet dump be more verbose, with higher
debugging level.

racoon
assumes the presence of the kernel random number device
rnd(4) at /dev/urandom.

RETURN VALUES

The command exits with 0 on
success, and non-zero on errors.

FILES
