NAME

pmloglabel
- check and repair a performance metrics archive label

SYNOPSIS

pmloglabel
[-lLsv?] [-h hostname] [-p
pid] [-V version] [-Z
timezone] archive

DESCRIPTION

pmloglabel
verifies, reports on, and can modify all details of the
labels in each of the files of a Performance Co-Pilot (PCP)
archive. The archive has the base name archive and
must have been previously created using
pmlogger(1).

Each of the
files in a PCP archive (metadata, temporal index, and one or
more data volumes) must contain a valid label at the start,
else the PCP tools will refuse to open the archive at
all.

Thus, the
primary function of pmloglabel is to be able to
repair any inconsistent or corrupt label fields, such that
the entire archive is not lost. It will not check the
remainder of the archive, but it will give you a fighting
chance to recover otherwise lost data. Together,
pmloglabel and pmlogextract are able to
produce a valid PCP archive from many forms of
corruption.

Note that if
the temporal index is found to be corrupt, the
"*.index" file can be safely moved aside and the
archive will still be accessible, however retrievals may
take longer without the index.

OPTIONS

The available
command line options are: 
-h hostname, --host=hostname

Modify the logged
hostname in the archive label, for all files in the
archive.

-l, --label

Dump out the archive label,
showing the archive format version, the time and date for
the start and (current) end of the archive, and the host
from which the performance metrics values were
collected.

-L

Like -l, just a little more verbose, showing also
the timezone and creator process identifier from the archive
label. 

-p pid,
--pid=pid

Set the process identifier
stored in the archive label to pid, for all files in
the archive.

-s

Rewrite the sentinel values which precede and follow the
archive label, for all files in the archive.

-v, --verbose

Verbose mode. Additional
progress information is produced at each step.

-V version,
--version=version

Stamp the version number
into the magic number field at the start of the archive
label, for all files in the archive.

-Z timezone,
--timezone=timezone

Changes the timezone in the
archive labels to timezone in the format of the
environment variable TZ as described in
environ(7).

-?, --help

Display usage message and
exit.

EXAMPLES

The following
demonstrates the use of pmloglabel in finding and
then correcting a corrupt field (PID) in the label of the
temporal index of an archive named "20080125".

$ pmdumplog -l
20080125 
pmdumplog: Cannot open archive "20080125": Illegal
label record at start of a PCP archive file 
$ pmloglabel 20080125 
Mismatched PID (5264/5011) between temporal index and data
volume 0 
$ pmloglabel -p 5264 20080125 
$ pmdumplog -l 20080125 
Log Label (Log Format Version 2) 
Performance metrics from host fw1 
commencing Fri Jan 25 00:10:09.341 2008 
ending Sat Jan 26 00:09:54.344 2008

EXIT STATUS

pmloglabel
exits with status 0 if the archive labels are clean. If
invoked incorrectly, the exit status will be 1. If
corruption is detected and still exists at the end, the exit
status will be 2. If requested to write out the archive
labels, and some aspect of that write out fails, then the
exit status will be 3.

FILES

$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmlogger/

Default directory for PCP
archives containing performance metric values collected from
the host .

PCP ENVIRONMENT

Environment
variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On
each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains
the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).
