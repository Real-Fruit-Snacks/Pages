ATTIMER(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual ATTIMER(4)

NAME

attimer &mdash; i8254
Programmable Interval Timer (AT Timer) driver

SYNOPSIS

This driver is a mandatory part
of x86 kernels.

The following
tunables are settable from the loader(8):

hint.attimer.X.clock

controls support for the event
timer functionality. Setting this value to 0 disables it.
The default value is 1.

hint.attimer.X.timecounter

controls support for the time
counter functionality. Setting this value to 0 disables it.
The default value is 1.

hw.i8254.freq

allows overriding the default
counter frequency. The same value is also available at
run-time via the machdep.i8254_freq sysctl.

DESCRIPTION

This driver uses i8254
Programmable Interval Timer (AT Timer) hardware to supply
the kernel with one timecounter and one event timer, and to
generate sound tones for the system speaker. This hardware
includes three channels. Each channel includes a 16 bit
counter which decreases with a known, platform-dependent
frequency. Counters can operate in several different modes,
including periodic and one-shot. The output of each channel
has platform-defined wiring: one channel is wired to the
interrupt controller and may be used as event timer, one
channel is wired to the speaker and used to generate sound
tones, and one timer is reserved for platform purposes.

The
attimer driver uses a single hardware channel to
provide both time counter and event timer functionality. To
make this possible, the respective counter must be running
in periodic mode. As a result, the one-shot event timer mode
is supported only when time counter functionality is
disabled.

The event timer
provided by the driver is irrelevant to CPU power
states.
