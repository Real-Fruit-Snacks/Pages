NAME

ifplugd.conf -
ifplugd configuration file

SYNOPSIS

/etc/default/ifplugd

DESCRIPTION

ifplugd.conf is
the configuration file for ifplugd. It is a shell script
that is sourced by the init script starting the daemon. It
shall be used to set environment variables which are
interpreted by the init script:

OPTIONS

INTERFACES

Specifies the ethernet
interfaces to monitor. It has to contain a space seperated
list of network interfaces names. Most users will probably
use "eth0" here, however you may add additional
interfaces for monitoring more than one device. A special
value is supported as well: "auto" will enable a
more or less working auto detection of available network
devices. This won&rsquo;t make you happy when using network
module auto loading, since it cannot detect currently
unloaded network devices.

HOTPLUG_INTERFACES

Specifies the interfaces that
can be hotplugged (like interfaces on PCMCIA, USB or WLAN
adapters). "all" can be used to make the udev
script start an ifplugd process for any hotplugged
interfaces (except those already listed in INTERFACES).

ARGS

Additional command line arguments for ifplugd
invocation. See ifplugd(8) for further
information. 

ARGS_iface

If specified for an interface
this variable takes precedence over ARGS. This may be useful
if more than one network device is present.
