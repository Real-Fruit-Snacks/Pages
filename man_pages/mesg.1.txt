MESG(1)                          User Commands                         MESG(1)

NAME
       mesg - display (or do not display) messages from other users

SYNOPSIS
       mesg [option] [n|y]

DESCRIPTION
       The mesg utility is invoked by a user to control write access others
       have to the terminal device associated with standard error output. If
       write access is allowed, then programs such as talk(1) and write(1) may
       display messages on the terminal.

       Traditionally, write access is allowed by default. However, as users
       become more conscious of various security risks, there is a trend to
       remove write access by default, at least for the primary login shell.

       The initial permissions for the terminal are set by login(1) according
       to TTYPERM and TTYGROUP from /etc/login.defs. The default is mode 0620
       if a tty group is used, and 0600 without the group. The default tty
       group name is "tty".

       To ensure that your ttys are set in a portable and independent manner
       from system settings, mesg should be executed in your login scripts.

       mesg modifies the write permissions for a group on the current terminal
       device. Since version 2.41, mesg can no longer be compiled to make the
       terminal writable for others and strictly modifies only group
       permissions. The usual setup is to use a "tty" group and add relevant
       users to this group. Alternatively, a less secure solution is to set
       utilities like write(1) or wall(1) to setgid for the "tty" group.

       The mesg utility silently exits with error status 2 if not executed on
       terminal. In this case execute mesg is pointless. The command line
       option --verbose forces mesg to print a warning in this situation. This
       behaviour has been introduced in version 2.33.

       n

       If no arguments are given, mesg shows the current message status on
       standard error output.
