NAME

nbdkit-partition-filter
- nbdkit partition filter

SYNOPSIS

nbdkit
--filter=partition plugin partition=PART
[plugin-args...]

DESCRIPTION

"nbdkit-partition-filter"
is a filter that limits requests to a single partition
within a disk image that is served by another plugin.

Partition
numbers are specified by the required "partition"
parameter, and count from 1.

This works like
the "qemu-nbd -P" option.

The opposite of
this filter is nbdkit-partitioning-plugin(1) which
adds a virtual partition table to a file or files.

PARAMETERS

partition=PART

The partition number to serve,
counting from 1.

This parameter
is required.

partition-sectorsize=SECTOR_SIZE

The default for this parameter
is chosen according to the minimum block size advertised by
the underlying device. If it is 512 or 4K, then the sector
size is set to that. If the underlying device does not
advertise a minimum block size, or it is something other
than 512 or 4K, the default is 512 bytes.

The user may
specify 512 or 4096 as the sector size manually via
config.

However set,
this parameter instructs the partition table logic to treat
the underlying storage as having the indicated sector size.
This is important for MBR and GPT logic using LBA (logical
block addressing).

EXAMPLE

disk.img
is a partitioned disk image (eg. a virtual machine disk
image). To serve the first partition only use:

nbdkit
--filter=partition file disk.img partition=1

FILES

$filterdir/nbdkit-partition-filter.so

The filter.

Use
"nbdkit --dump-config" to find the location of
$filterdir.

VERSION

"nbdkit-partition-filter"
first appeared in nbdkit 1.2.
