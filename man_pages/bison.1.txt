DESCRIPTION

Bison is
a parser generator in the style of yacc(1). It should
be upwardly compatible with input files designed for
yacc.

Input files
should follow the yacc convention of ending in
.y. Unlike yacc, the generated files do not
have fixed names, but instead use the prefix of the input
file. For instance, a grammar description file named
parse.y would produce the generated parser in a file
named parse.tab.c, instead of yacc’s
y.tab.c.

This
description of the options that can be given to bison
is adapted from the node Invocation in the
bison.texinfo manual, which should be taken as
authoritative.

Bison
supports both traditional single-letter options and mnemonic
long option names. Long option names are indicated with
-- instead of -. Abbreviations for option
names are allowed as long as they are unique. When a long
option takes an argument, like --file-prefix, connect
the option name and the argument with =.

OPTIONS 
-b file-prefix 
--file-prefix=file-prefix

Specify a prefix to use for all
bison output file names. The names are chosen as if
the input file were named file-prefix.c.

-d

--defines

Write an extra output file
containing macro definitions for the token type names
defined in the grammar and the semantic value type
YYSTYPE, as well as a few extern variable
declarations.

If the parser
output file is named name.c then this file is
named name.h.

This output
file is essential if you wish to put the definition of
yylex in a separate source file, because yylex
needs to be able to refer to token type codes and the
variable yylval.

-l

--no-lines

Don’t put any
#line preprocessor commands in the parser file.
Ordinarily bison puts them in the parser file so that
the C compiler and debuggers will associate errors with your
source file, the grammar file. This option causes them to
associate errors with the parser file, treating it an
independent source file in its own right.

-o outfile

--output-file=outfile

Specify the name outfile
for the parser file.

The other
output files’ names are constructed from
outfile as described under the -v and
-d switches.

-p prefix 
--name-prefix=prefix

Rename the external symbols
used in the parser so that they start with prefix
instead of yy. The precise list of symbols renamed is
yyparse, yylex, yyerror, yylval,
yychar, and yydebug.

For example, if
you use -p c, the names become cparse,
clex, and so on.

-t

--debug

Output a definition of the
macro YYDEBUG into the parser file, so that the
debugging facilities are compiled.

-v

--verbose

Write an extra output file
containing verbose descriptions of the parser states and
what is done for each type of look-ahead token in that
state.

This file also
describes all the conflicts, both those resolved by operator
precedence and the unresolved ones.

The
file’s name is made by removing .tab.c or
.c from the parser output file name, and adding
.output instead.

Therefore, if
the input file is foo.y, then the parser file is
called foo.tab.c by default. As a consequence, the
verbose output file is called foo.output.

-V

--version

Print the version number of
bison.

-y

--yacc

--fixed-output-files

Equivalent to -o
y.tab.c; the parser output file is called
y.tab.c, and the other outputs are called
y.output and y.tab.h. The purpose of this
switch is to imitate yacc’s output file name
conventions. Thus, the following shell script can substitute
for yacc:

bison -y
$*

The long-named
options can be introduced with ’+’ as well as
’--’, for compatibility with previous releases.
Eventually support for ’+’ will be removed,
because it is incompatible with the POSIX.2 standard.
