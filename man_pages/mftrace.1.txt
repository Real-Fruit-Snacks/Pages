NAME

mftrace -
convert METAFONT format fonts into Type1 outline fonts

SYNOPSIS

mftrace
[options] fontname

DESCRIPTION

mftrace
is a program that can convert a METAFONT font into a Type1
font. It is simply called with the name of the font (without
a &rsquo;.mf&rsquo; suffix) and produces a Type1 font file
called either fontname.pfa or fontname.pfb
depending on the command line options. With the help of
fontforge(1) it can produce other font formats
too.

For tracing the
bitmap, mftrace either uses potrace(1) or
autotrace(1) (the former preferred) if available;
this can be overridden with the --autotrace and
--potrace command line options.

OPTIONS

This program
follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options
starting with two dashes (&rsquo;-&rsquo;). 
-k, --keep

Keep all output in directory
&rsquo;mftrace.dir&rsquo;.

--magnification=MAG

The magnification to use for
the PFA file. The default is 1000. The larger the
magnification, the more precise the PFA file will be.
However, if the magnification is too large METAFONT can
crash with overflow errors.

Sadly, many MF
fonts contain resolution checks

if
dots_per_inch * design_size > 1500:

This check is
susceptible to overflow errors. Such code should be reported
as a bug, and changed to

if
dots_per_inch > (1500 / design_size):

--formats=FMT1,FMT2,...

Specify which formats to
generate (default is pfa). Choices are: &rsquo;afm&rsquo;,
&rsquo;pfa&rsquo;, &rsquo;pfb&rsquo;, &rsquo;ttf&rsquo;,
&rsquo;svg&rsquo;. Note that fontforge must be
installed to generate any format except &rsquo;pfa&rsquo; or
&rsquo;pfb&rsquo;. For generating &rsquo;afm&rsquo; you need
either fontforge or ghostscript.

--simplify

This passes the created Type1
font to fontforge to simplify and autohint it.

--gffile=FILE

Use generic font file
FILE instead of running Metafont. (GF is the default
output format of Metafont.)

-I DIR,
--include=DIR

Add DIR to the current
path for searching files.

--glyphs=LIST

Process only these glyphs.
LIST is a comma separated list of decimal numbers or
ranges, for example &rsquo;1-10,50,55,90-100&rsquo;.

--tfmfile=FILE

Use FILE for the TFM
file. (The default is to use fontname.tfm).

-e ENC,
--encoding=ENC

Use encoding file ENC.
Encoding files used by mftrace are basically in the
GhostScript/dvips format, but you may use a special
.notavail glyph name in order to tell mftrace not to
process a specific glyph. If this option is not specified,
mftrace tries to determine the encoding file
automatically, from the encoding specified in the TFM file,
the default being &rsquo;tex256.enc&rsquo;.

--keep-trying

Try to continue if external
programs called by mftrace fail. If METAFONT crashes with
overflow errors, but nevertheless outputs a GF file, try to
process its output as is (useful for some buggy fonts, see
above). If potrace or autotrace fail to trace
a specific character, first try it with a less smoothed
curve, and if that fails, skip the character. By default,
mftrace leaves a file
&rsquo;trace-bug-font-char.pbm&rsquo; and
stops the process with a request to file a bugreport.

--dos-kpath

Try to use MikTeX&rsquo;s
version of kpsewhich.

--potrace

Use potrace for tracing
bitmaps. The default is to use potrace if it is
found, otherwise to use autotrace.

--autotrace

Use autotrace for
tracing bitmaps.

--no-afm

Don&rsquo;t read the AFM file
to find font information.

--noround

Do not round coordinates of
control points to integer values (use with --grid).
Disabled by default.

--grid=GRID

Set reciprocal grid size in em
units multiplied by ratio magnification/1000. For example,
&rsquo;--grid 10
--magnification 1000&rsquo; rounds coordinates of
control points to 1/10th of the em unit. Useful
simultaneously with the --noround option. Default
GRID value is 1, i.e., round to integer. This
option is only used with potrace.

-D,--define=SYMBOL=VALUE

Set the font info SYMBOL
to the given VALUE. For example,
-DFamilyName=Foo sets the font family name to
Foo. mftrace tries to fill in sensible default
values for the &rsquo;FontName&rsquo;,
&rsquo;FamilyName&rsquo;, &rsquo;FullName&rsquo; and
&rsquo;Weight&rsquo; fields.

-V, --verbose

Be verbose.

-h, --help

Show summary of options.

-v, --version

Show version of program.

-w, --warranty

Show warranty and
copyright.
