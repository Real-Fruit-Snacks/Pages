RELEASE NOTES FOR LIBGUESTFS 1.42

Please note
that virt-v2v, virt-p2v and the boot analysis tools were
moved out of the libguestfs package / repository into
separate projects. See:

&bull;

https://github.com/libguestfs/virt-v2v

&bull;

https://github.com/libguestfs/virt-p2v

&bull;

https://github.com/libguestfs/libguestfs-analysis-tools 

Those projects
are now on a separate release cycle. Release notes are
published separately.

New
features 
Add support for the Vala language (Corentin No&euml;l).

Add support for
the Rust language (Hiroyuki Katsura, sponsored by Google
Summer of Code).

Reproducible
builds (Chris Lamb).

Advanced Format
disks (which use 4K sectors) can now be processed by
libguestfs. Use the new optional "blocksize"
parameter to "guestfs_add_drive_opts", and the
--blocksize option added to several tools (Nikolay
Ivanets).

Windows
CompactOS (NTFS file compression) is now supported.

New features
in existing tools

Advanced
machine readable output in various virt tools now supports
JSON output, and writing logs to a numbered file descriptor
(Pino Toscano).

virt-filesystems
tool now more accurately reports filesystem total size, in
the case where for example the filesystem does not occupy
the whole of its containing device (Pino Toscano).

Language
bindings

Python &ge; 2.7
is required.

Python bindings
are now more extensively tested (Hiroyuki Katsura).

Python bindings
should now work with Python &ge; 3.8.

Multiple fixes
to avoid crashes in the Python bindings (Sam Eiderman).

OCaml bindings
are compiled with "-DCAML_NAME_SPACE" to ensure no
non-caml_-namespaced symbols are used (Pino Toscano).

OCaml bindings
should now work with OCaml 4.09 and 4.10.

Erlang has
deprecated the old "erl_interface" library which
we use for Erlang bindings. It will be removed in OTP 22,
which will permanently break Erlang support unless someone
steps forward to update the Erlang bindings in
libguestfs.

Fix
compatibility with newer cgo for Go bindings
(Tom&aacute;&scaron; Golembiovsk&yacute;).

Go API error
handling is now more idiomatic (Csaba Henk).

Update
documentation about how to handle boolean parameters in Ruby
bindings (Csaba Henk).

Inspection

Libguestfs can
now extract icons for Gentoo, newer SUSE and OpenMandriva
guests. Improved extraction of RHEL icons. (Pino
Toscano).

Inspection
returns the osinfo IDs of newer Windows versions, and
rolling Linux distros (Pino Toscano).

OpenMandriva is
now detected (Bernhard Rosenkr&auml;nzer).

Arch Linux
detection improvements (Pino Toscano).

Architectures
and platforms

Libguestfs can
now be compiled on OpenMandriva (Bernhard
Rosenkr&auml;nzer).

Ubuntu fix for
enabling network support (Ioanna Alifieraki).

Other

Use of
deprecated libguestfs APIs will now cause compiler
deprecation warnings by default, whereas previously you have
to enable these warnings. To turn off these warnings use
"-DGUESTFS_NO_WARN_DEPRECATED=1". A new feature is
that you can now disable deprecated APIs completely if you
want, using "-DGUESTFS_NO_DEPRECATED=1" (Pino
Toscano).

Fix hostname in
virt-builder templates (Pino Toscano).

The single
large release notes file is now split into multiple
documents organized by version.

The
"--key" option of several tools was broken,
especially if you tried to use the option to pass multiple
keys. This has been fixed and a regression test added.

Augeas
exceptions occurring in daemon (eg. during inspection) will
now produced detailed errors (Pino Toscano).

Security

No security issues were found in this release.

API

New APIs

"luks_uuid"
returns the UUID of a LUKS device (Pino Toscano).

Other API
changes

Cope with new
output from the "btrfs scrub" command. There is no
visible change at the API level.

New optional
parameter "blocksize" added to
"guestfs_add_drive_opts" to support Advanced
Format disks (Nikolay Ivanets).

Build
changes 
Minimum version of Augeas required is 1.2.0 (Pino
Toscano).

"common/"
subdirectory is now a git submodule shared with the virt-v2v
project.

Supermin &ge;
5.1.18 is required.

There were
several bugs in libvirt 5.10.0 and 6.0 which affected
libguestfs. It is highly advisable to use libvirt 6.1 where
these bugs are fixed (versions of libvirt 

Many gnulib
modules which we were not using or which we used in only a
few places have been removed (Pino Toscano).

Multiple fixes
for builddir != sourcedir builds (Pino Toscano).

A new
"bundled/" subdirectory contains one bundled
library that we currently use, "ocaml-augeas"
(Pino Toscano).

Fix
compatibility issues when being compiled with GCC 10.

Internals

When linking OCaml programs, automake silent rules and the
"V=1" flag are both now obeyed (Pino Toscano).

The
"guestfs_device_index" API was reimplemented in
library code instead of in the daemon. There should be no
observable effect of this change.

Since Linux 5.6
enumerates "/dev/sdX" devices in parallel,
libguestfs was changed to map API device names to appliance
device names, and then do the reverse mapping when returning
names from the appliance. Hopefully this should have no
observable effect, but can produce somewhat confusing
debugging messages since device names in the debug might not
match device names passed in to APIs. Furthermore the
"root=UUID=..." option is always passed to the
appliance (instead of naming the device containing the root
filesystem).

We expect to
move from the Zanata service to the Weblate service for
translated strings. For more information see
