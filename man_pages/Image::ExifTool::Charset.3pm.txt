NAME
       Image::ExifTool::Charset - ExifTool character encoding routines

SYNOPSIS
       This module is required by Image::ExifTool.

DESCRIPTION
       This module contains routines used by ExifTool to translate special
       character sets.  Currently, the following character sets are supported:

         UTF8, UTF16, UCS2, UCS4, Arabic, Baltic, Cyrillic, Greek, Hebrew, JIS,
         Latin, Latin2, DOSLatinUS, DOSLatin1, DOSCyrillic, MacArabic,
         MacChineseCN, MacChineseTW, MacCroatian, MacCyrillic, MacGreek, MacHebrew,
         MacIceland, MacJapanese, MacKorean, MacLatin2, MacRSymbol, MacRoman,
         MacRomanian, MacThai, MacTurkish, PDFDoc, RSymbol, ShiftJIS, Symbol, Thai,
         Turkish, Vietnam

       However, only some of these character sets are available to the user
       via ExifTool options -- the multi-byte character sets are used only
       internally when decoding certain types of information.
