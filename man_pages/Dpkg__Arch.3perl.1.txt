NAME
       Dpkg::Arch - handle architectures

DESCRIPTION
       The Dpkg::Arch module provides functions to handle Debian
       architectures, wildcards, and mapping from and to GNU triplets.

       No symbols are exported by default. The :all tag can be used to import
       all symbols. The :getters, :parsers, :mappers and :operators tags can
       be used to import specific symbol subsets.

FUNCTIONS
       $arch = get_raw_build_arch()
           Get the raw build Debian architecture, without taking into account
           variables from the environment.

       $arch = get_build_arch()
           Get the build Debian architecture, using DEB_BUILD_ARCH from the
           environment if available.

       $arch = get_raw_host_arch()
           Get the raw host Debian architecture, without taking into account
           variables from the environment.

       $arch = get_host_arch()
           Get the host Debian architecture, using DEB_HOST_ARCH from the
           environment if available.

       @arch_list = get_valid_arches()
           Get an array with all currently known Debian architectures.

       $multiarch = gnutriplet_to_multiarch($gnutriplet)
           Map a GNU triplet into a Debian multiarch triplet.

       $multiarch = debarch_to_multiarch($arch)
           Map a Debian architecture into a Debian multiarch triplet.

       $gnutriplet = debarch_to_gnutriplet($arch)
           Map a Debian architecture into a GNU triplet.

       $arch = gnutriplet_to_debarch($gnutriplet)
           Map a GNU triplet into a Debian architecture.

       $bool = debarch_eq($arch_a, $arch_b)
           Evaluate the equality of a Debian architecture, by comparing with
           another Debian architecture. No wildcard matching is performed.

       $bool = debarch_is($arch, $arch_wildcard)
           Evaluate the identity of a Debian architecture, by matching with an
           architecture wildcard.

       $bool = debarch_is_wildcard($arch)
           Evaluate whether a Debian architecture is an architecture wildcard.

       $bool = debarch_is_illegal($arch, %options)
           Validate an architecture name.

           If the "positive" option is set to a true value, only positive
           architectures will be accepted, otherwise negated architectures are
           allowed.

       $bool = debarch_is_concerned($arch, @arches)
           Evaluate whether a Debian architecture applies to the list of
           architecture restrictions, as usually found in dependencies inside
           square brackets.

       @array = debarch_list_parse($arch_list, %options)
           Parse an architecture list.

           If the "positive" option is set to a true value, only positive
           architectures will be accepted, otherwise negated architectures are
           allowed.

CHANGES
   Version 1.03 (dpkg 1.19.1)
       New argument: Accept a "positive" option in debarch_is_illegal() and

       New import tags: ":all", ":getters", ":parsers", ":mappers",
       ":operators".

   Version 1.01 (dpkg 1.18.5)
       New functions: debarch_is_illegal(), debarch_list_parse().
