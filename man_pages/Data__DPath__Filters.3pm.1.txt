NAME
       Data::DPath::Filters - Magic functions available inside filter
       conditions

API METHODS
   affe
       Mysterious test function. Will vanish. Soon. Or will it really? No,
       probably not. I like it. :-)

       Returns true if the value eq "affe".

   idx
       Returns the current index inside array elements.

       Please note that the current matching elements might not be in a
       defined order if resulting from anything else than arrays.

   size
       Returns the size of the current element. If it is an array ref it
       returns the number of elements, if it is a hash ref it returns number
       of keys, if it is a scalar it returns 1, everything else returns -1.

   key
       If it is a hashref returns the key under which the current element is
       associated as value. Else it returns undef.

       This gives the key() function kind of a "look back" behaviour because
       the associated point is already after that key.

   value
       Returns the value of the current element.

   isa
       Frontend to UNIVERSAL::isa. True if the current element is_a given
       class.

   reftype
       Frontend to Scalar::Util::reftype.

       Returns Scalar::Util::reftype of current element $_. With this you can
       do comparison by yourself with "eq", "=~", "~~" or whatever in filter
       expressions.

   is_reftype($EXPECTED_TYPE)
       Frontend to Scalar::Util::reftype.

       Checks whether Scalar::Util::reftype of current element $_ equals the
       provided argument $EXPECTED_TYPE and returns true/false.
