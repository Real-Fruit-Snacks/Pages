APPLY(1) BSD General Commands Manual APPLY(1)

NAME

apply &mdash; apply a
command to a set of arguments

SYNOPSIS

apply
[&minus;a c] [&minus;d]
[&minus;#] command argument ...

DESCRIPTION

The apply utility runs
the named command on each argument argument in
turn.

Character
sequences of the form &rsquo;&rsquo;%d&rsquo;&rsquo; in
command, where &rsquo;d&rsquo; is a digit from 1 to
9, are replaced by the d&acute;th following unused
argument. In this case, the largest digit number of
arguments are discarded for each execution of
command.

The options are
as follows:

&minus;#

Normally
arguments are taken singly; the optional number
&minus;# specifies the number of arguments to be
passed to command. If the number is zero,
command is run, without arguments, once for each
argument.

If any
sequences of &rsquo;&rsquo;%d&rsquo;&rsquo; occur in
command, the &minus;# option is ignored.

&minus;a c

The use of the
character &rsquo;%&rsquo; as a magic character may be
changed with the &minus;a option.

&minus;d

Display the
commands that would have been executed, but do not actually
execute them.

ENVIRONMENT

The following environment
variable affects the execution of apply:

SHELL

Pathname of
shell to use. If this variable is not defined, the Bourne
shell is used.

EXAMPLES 
apply echo a*

is similar to ls(1);

apply &minus;2 cmp a1 b1 a2 b2 a3 b3

compares the &rsquo;a&rsquo;
files to the &rsquo;b&rsquo; files;

apply &minus;0 who 1 2 3 4 5

runs who(1) 5 times; and

apply &acute;ln %1 /usr/joe&acute; *

links all files in the current
directory to the directory /usr/joe.

FILES 
/bin/sh

default
shell

BUGS

Shell metacharacters in
command may have bizarre effects; it is best to
enclose complicated commands in single quotes
(&rsquo;&rsquo;).
