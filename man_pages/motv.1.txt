NAME

motv - a Motif
program for watching TV

SYNOPSIS

motv [
options ] [ station name ]

DESCRIPTION

motv is
a Motif application for watching TV with your unix box.

It is basically
xawtv with a more userfriendly GUI. It has the same
features, uses the same config file, has the same command
line switches, you can control it using xawtv-remote. Most
keyboards shortcuts are identical too.

OPTIONS

All command
line options also have a Resource, so you can put them into
your .Xdefaults file too. 
-h, -help

Print a short description of
all command line options.

-hwscan

Print a list of available
devices.

-f,
-fullscreen

startup in fullscreen mode.

Resource: motv.fullscreen (bool).

-n, -noconf

don&rsquo;t read the config
file ($HOME/.xawtv). 
Resource: motv.readconfig (bool).

-o, -outfile
base

set basestring for the snapshot
output files. The filename will be
"base-timestamp-nr.ext". 
Resource: motv.basename (string).

-c, -device
device

set video4linux device (default
is /dev/video0). This option also disables Xvideo support.

Resource: motv.device (string).

-C, -dspdev
device

set audio device (default is
/dev/dsp). 
Resource: motv.dspdev (string).

-vbidev device

set vbi device (default is
/dev/vbi). 
Resource: motv.vbidev (string).

-c, -xvport
number

set Xvideo port (defaults to
the first usable if Xvideo is available). This option also
enables Xvideo support. 
Resource: motv.xvport (int).

-joydev device

joystick device to use for
controlling xawtv. 
Resource: xawtv.joydev (string).

-v, -debug
level

Be verbose, level may be
0 (default), 1 or 2. It exists just for debugging and
trouble-shooting. 
Resource: motv.debug (int).

-remote

X11 display is remote. This
basically disables overlay mode, you might need this if
xawtv fails to autodetect a remote X11 display. 
Resource: motv.remote (bool).

-b, -bpp n

force xawtv into n bpp
color depth. Works for switching between 15/16 and 24/32
bpp. This gets just passed through to v4l-conf(8). 
Resource: motv.bpp (int).

-shift n

Shift the video display by
n bytes. Try this if your video display is&rsquo;nt
within the xawtv window, some older matrox cards show this
problem. This gets passed through to v4l-conf(8) too. 
Resource: motv.shift (int).

-fb

Use the framebuffer device to determine the video
framebuffer address (instead of the DGA extension). Yet
another pass through argument.

Resource: motv.fbdev
(bool).

-xv/-noxv

enable/disable the usage of the
Xvideo extension altogether, i.e. -noxv has the same effect
as both -noxv-video and -noxv-image switches (see below).

Resource: xawtv.xv (bool).

-xv-video/-noxv-video

enable/disable the usage of the
Xvideo extension for video overlay (i.e. XvPutVideo).
overlay mode uses this. default is on. 
Resource: xawtv.xvVideo (bool).

-xv-image/-noxv-image

enable/disable the usage of the
Xvideo extension for image scaling (i.e. XvPutImage).
grabdisplay mode uses this. default is on. 
Resource: xawtv.xvImage (bool).

-vm/-novm

enable/disable the usage of the
VidMode extension, default is off. If there is a fullscreen
video mode configured in the config file, the vidmode
extension will be enabled automatically. 
Resource: motv.vidmode (bool).

-dga/-nodga

enable/disable the usage of the
DGA extension, default is on. 
Resource: motv.dga (bool).

-parallel n

use n compression threads
(default: one). 
Resource: xawtv.parallel (int).

The usual
toolkit options like -geometry are supported too.

SUPPORTED HARDWARE / INTERFACES

v4l

video4linux - the linux
video capture API.

v4l2

video4linux two - new, improved capture interface which
fixes a number of v4l design bugs.

bktr

FreeBSD / OpenBSD driver for bt848/878 grabber
cards. 

Xvideo

X11 Extension for video devices. Note that the Xvideo
extension does support overlay only, you can&rsquo;t capture
images/movies if the Xvideo extension is used. On the other
hand this is the only way to scaled video overlay (i.e.
fullscreen without black borders @ 1024x748) if both
hardware and xfree86 driver support it. See README.xfree4
for more details and hints on how to setup Xvideo.

GETTING STARTED

motv
starts up with the TV window. The left mouse button shows a
menu with all TV Stations (empty until you have defined
some). The right mouse button brings up the control
window.

The first time
you have configure motv, i.e. set TV norm and frequency
table to the correct values. Check if the hardware works
correctly (if tuning does not work it is very likely a
driver configuration issue). If the hardware operates fine,
you can let motv look for TV stations (Options => Channel
scan). The channel buttons have a context menu for deleting
and editing. Don&rsquo;t forget to save your configuration
when you are done.

You can also
create/edit a config file with any text editor, see
xawtvrc(5) for a description of the config file syntax.
There are a number of config options which can only be set
by editing the config file.

KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS

Some of them
work in the TV window only. The cursor keys for example are
used by the motif toolkit to allow full keyboard control of
the GUI and therefore have other functions in the control
window.

V Video
(Capture) on/off 
A Audio on/off 
F Fullscreen on/off 
G Grab picture (full size, ppm) 
J Grab picture (full size, jpeg) 
Ctrl+G Grab picture (window size, ppm) 
Ctrl+J Grab picture (window size, jpeg) 
Ctrl+C Copy to clipboard. 
C Popup Control Window 
R Popup AVI Recording Window 
S Popup Scale controls 
Z Channel Hopper (zapping, tune in every 
station a few seconds) 
Ctrl+Z Fast Channel Hopping (grab the images for the 
Channel Bottons)

up/down tune
up/down one channel 
left/right fine tuning 
pgup/pgdown station up/down (the ones you have in the config
file) 
space next station (same as pgup) 
backspace previously tuned station 
Ctrl+up scan for next station

ESC,Q
Quit

+/- Volume
up/down (keypad) 
Enter mute (keypad)

BUGS

Bug reports
with images attached go to /dev/null unseen.

motv depends on
a correct driver configuration. If you can&rsquo;t tune TV
stations even if the settings in the options window are
correct it is very likely a driver issue.

MISC

Huh? Still with
me? Looks like some people do read manuals
carefully.
