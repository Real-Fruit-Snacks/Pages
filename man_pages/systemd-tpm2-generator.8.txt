NAME

systemd-tpm2-generator
- Generator for inserting TPM2 synchronization point in the
boot process

SYNOPSIS

/usr/lib/systemd/system-generators/systemd-tpm2-generator

DESCRIPTION

systemd-tpm2-generator
is a generator that adds a Wants= dependency from
sysinit.target to tpm2.target when it detects that the
firmware discovered a TPM2 device but the OS kernel so far
did not. tpm2.target is supposed to act as synchronization
point for all services that require TPM2 device access. See
systemd.special(7) for details.

The
systemd.tpm2_wait= kernel command line option may be
used to override behaviour of the generator. It accepts a
boolean value: if true then tpm2.target will be added as
synchronization point even if the firmware has not detected
a TPM2 device. If false, the target will not be inserted
even if firmware reported a device but the OS kernel doesn't
expose a device for it yet. The latter might be useful in
environments where a suitable TPM2 driver for the available
hardware is not available.

systemd-tpm2-generator
implements systemd.generator(7).
