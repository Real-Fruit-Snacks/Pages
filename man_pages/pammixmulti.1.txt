NAME

pammixmulti -
blend together multiple PAM images

SYNOPSIS

pammixmulti

[--blend=average|random|mask] 
[--maskfile=filename] 
[--stdev=number] 
[--randomseed integer] 
filename ...

Minimum unique
abbreviation of an option is acceptable. You can use a
single hyphen instead of double hyphens to denote options.
You can use white space in place of the equals sign to
separate an option name from its value.

DESCRIPTION

This file is
part of Netpbm(1).

pammixmulti
mixes two or more images to produce a new image. The program
provides multiple ways to interpret "mix."

OPTIONS

In addition to
the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most
notably -quiet, see
 Common Options ),
pammixmulti recognizes the following command line
options: 
--blend=average|random|mask

This option
specifies how the input images should be mixed to produce
the output image. With --blend=average (the default),
each pixel in the output is produced by averaging the
corresponding pixels from all the input images. With
--blend=random, each pixel in the output is produced
by selecting the corresponding pixel from one of the input
images, chosen at random on a per-pixel basis. With
--blend=mask, each pixel in the output is produced by
a weighted average of the corresponding pixels from all the
input images based on the grayscale level of an additional
mask image.

--maskfile=filename

In conjunction
with --blend=mask, this option names a grayscale mask
file to control the blending of each pixel. (If the file is
not grayscale, the first channel is treated as gray). Where
the mask file is black, the first image is selected. Where
the mask file is white, the last image is selected.
Intermediate levels of gray select intermediate images.

--stdev=number

When used with
--blend=mask, this option controls how smoothly the
various input images are mixed to produce each output pixel.
For example, consider running pammixmulti with three
input images and a mask image that uses gray levels from 0
to 255. Given --stdev=0.0, gray levels 0-84 produce
exclusively image 1; gray levels 85-170 produce exclusively
image 2; and gray levels 171-255 produce exclusively image
3. If the argument to --stdev is positive, images are
blended according to a normal distribution. Hence, gray
levels around 85 produce an output pixel that includes
roughly equal amounts of the corresponding pixel from images
1 and 2 but less of the corresponding pixel from image 3. As
number tends towards the number of input images
(going beyond that has diminishing impact), the output tends
to look more like --blend=average. number
defaults to 0.25.

--randomseed
integer

This is the seed for the random
number generator used with --blend=random

Use this to
ensure you get the same image on separate invocations.

ARGUMENTS

You supply the
names of the files to mix as non-option arguments.

EXAMPLES

Average a bunch
of PPM images to produce a new PAM image: 
pammixmulti input*.ppm >output.ppm

Mix these same
images by taking each pixel from a randomly selected input
image:

pammixmulti
--blend=random input*.ppm >output.ppm

Use a mask
image to control the fading among input images on a
pixel-by-pixel basis:

pammixmulti
--blend=mask --maskfile=mask.pgm >output.pam \ 
one.pam two.pam three.pam four.pam

Do the same but
with more abrupt transitions:

pammixmulti
--blend=mask --maskfile=mask.pgm --stdev=0.0 >output.pam
\ 
one.pam two.pam three.pam four.pam

and now with
more gradual transitions:

pammixmulti
--blend=mask --maskfile=mask.pgm --stdev=1.0 >output.pam
\ 
one.pam two.pam three.pam four.pam
