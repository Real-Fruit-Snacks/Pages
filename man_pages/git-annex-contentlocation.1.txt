NAME

git-annex-contentlocation
- looks up content for a key

SYNOPSIS

git annex
contentlocation [key ...]

DESCRIPTION

This
plumbing-level command looks up filename used to store the
content of a key. The filename is output to stdout. If the
key&rsquo;s content is not present in the local repository,
nothing is output, and it exits nonzero.

OPTIONS

--batch

Enable batch
mode, in which a line containing the key is read from stdin,
the filename to its content is output to stdout (with a
trailing newline), and repeat.

Note that if a
key&rsquo;s content is not present, an empty line is output
to stdout instead.

Also the
git-annex-common-options(1) can be used.
