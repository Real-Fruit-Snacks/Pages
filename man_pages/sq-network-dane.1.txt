NAME

sq network dane
- Retrieve and publishes certificates via DANE

SYNOPSIS

sq network
dane generate [OPTIONS] FQDN CERT-RING

sq network dane fetch [OPTIONS]
ADDRESS

DESCRIPTION

Retrieve and
publishes certificates via DANE.

DNS-Based
Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) is a method for
publishing and retrieving certificates in DNS as specified
in RFC 7929.

SUBCOMMANDS

sq network
dane generate 
Generate DANE records for the given domain and certs.

The
certificates are minimized, and one record per email address
is emitted. If multiple user IDs map to one email address,
then all matching user IDs are included in the emitted
certificates.

By default,
OPENPGPKEY resource records are emitted. If your DNS server
doesn’t understand those, use ’--generic’
to emit generic records instead.

sq network
dane fetch 
Retrieve certificates using DANE.

By default, any
returned certificates are stored in the local certificate
store. This can be overridden by using
’--output’ option.

When a
certificate is retrieved using DANE, and imported into the
local certificate store, any User IDs with the email address
that was looked up are certificated with a local
DANE-specific key. That proxy certificate is in turn
certified as a minimally trusted CA (trust amount: 1 of 120)
by the local trust root. How much the DANE proxy CA is
trusted can be tuned using ’sq pki link add’ or
’sq pki link retract’ in the usual way.

EXAMPLES

sq network
dane generate 
Generate DANE records from certs.pgp for example.com.

sq dane
generate example.com certs.pgp
