NAME

ximtoppm -
convert an Xim file to a PPM image

SYNOPSIS

ximtoppm

[--alphaout={alpha-filename,-}]
[ximfile]

DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

ximptoppm
reads an Xim file as input and produces a PPM image as
output. The Xim toolkit is included in the contrib tree of
the X.V11R4 release.

OPTIONS

In addition to
the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most
notably -quiet, see
 Common Options ),
ximtoppm recognizes the following command line
option:

You can
abbreviate any option to its shortest unique prefix. 
--alphaout=alpha-filename

ximtoppm creates a PGM
file containing the transparency channel values in the input
image. If the input image doesn’t contain a
transparency channel, the alpha-filename file
contains all zero (transparent) transparency values. If you
don’t specify --alphaout, ximtoppm does
not generate a transparency file, and if the input image has
a transparency channel, ximtoppm simply discards
it.

If you specify
- as the filename, ximtoppm writes the
transparency output to Standard Output and discards the
image.

Actually, an
Xim image can contain an arbitrary fourth channel -- it need
not be a transparency channel. ximtoppm extracts any
fourth channel it finds as described above; it doesn’t
matter if it is a transparency channel or not.

See
pamcomp(1) for one way to use the transparency output
file.
