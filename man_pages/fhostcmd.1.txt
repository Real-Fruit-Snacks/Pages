NAME

fhostcmd, fhost
− set environment variables

SYNOPSIS

fhostcmd [-d
delay] [-p local port] [-l local directory] [-o timeout]
[-t trace] [-w password] [-f filename] [-h number | name]
[-c | -b] [host port [directory] | abbreviation]

fhost [-d
delay] [-p local port] [-l local directory] [-o timeout]
[-t trace] [-w password] [-f filename] [-h number | name]
[-c | -b] [host port [directory] | abbreviation]

DESCRIPTION

fhost
uses a resources files to set all environmant variables
needed to connect to a given host via FSP. If a -f option is
given, the given filename is also used as resources file.
fhost loads all available resource files. If server
is defined in multiple files, first match is returned. Load
order is .fsp_prof in the current working directory
and in the user’s home directory. Then a system wide
default file is used. If fhost is invoked with an
abbreviation given, the resource files are searched for the
first host to match this abbreviation. The values given for
this host will be set.

If fhost
is invoked with a given host and port number, this host will
be used and no searching in the resource file will be
done.

Setting up the
host the user can change between using the host name or the
internet address. In case only one is given and the other
should be used fhost tries to find it using a built
in mini-nslookup facility. The default is to use what is
given and to use the number if both are given.

Since programs
cannot change environment variables of their parent shell in
a simple way, it is recommended that the user defines a
shell alias or function to make it possible. csh
example:

alias fhost
’eval ’fhostcmd *’’

FSP_PROF

For more
information about the resource file confer
fsp_prof(5). Here’s just a short example of how
it works. If your resource file contains the following

host
seismo.soar.cs.cmu.edu 
fsp port 30 
local directory ~/sources/fsp-266.1 
trace off

a call of
fhost seismo in csh will produce the following
output to be evaluated

unsetenv
FSP_TRACE; 
setenv FSP_PORT 30; 
setenv FSP_LOCAL_DIR ~/sources/fsp-266.1; 
setenv FSP_HOST seismo.soar.cs.cmu.edu; 
setenv FSP_DIR /;

ARGUMENTS

-d --
set FSP_DELAY to delay

-p --
set FSP_LOCALPORT to local port

-l --
set FSP_LOCAL_DIR to local directory

-o --
set FSP_TIMEOUT to timeout

-t --
set FSP_TRACE if trace = on, unset it if
trace = off

-p --
set FSP_PASSWORD to password

-f --
use filename as resource file

-b --
output Bourne shell code

-c --
output C shell code

ENVIRONMENT

The environment
variables associate this program with a FSP database and are
set (resp. unset) if needed. See fsp_env(7) for list.
