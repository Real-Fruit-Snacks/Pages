NAME

slapo-dyngroup
- Dynamic Group overlay to slapd

SYNOPSIS

/etc/ldap/slapd.conf

DESCRIPTION

The Dynamic
Group overlay allows clients to use LDAP Compare operations
to test the membership of a dynamic group the same way they
would check against a static group. Compare operations
targeting a group&rsquo;s static member attribute will be
intercepted and tested against the configured dynamic
group&rsquo;s URL attribute.

Note that this
intercept only happens if the actual Compare operation does
not return a LDAP_COMPARE_TRUE result. So if a group has
both static and dynamic members, the static member list will
be checked first.

CONFIGURATION

This
slapd.conf option applies to the Dynamic Group
overlay. It should appear after the overlay
directive. 
attrpair  

Specify the attributes to be
compared. A compare operation on the memberAttr will
cause the URLattr to be evaluated for the result.

EXAMPLES

database mdb

... 
overlay dyngroup 
attrpair member memberURL

FILES

BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY

The dyngroup
overlay has been reworked with the 2.5 release to use a
consistent namespace as with other overlays. As a
side-effect the following cn=config parameters are
deprecated and will be removed in a future release:
olcDGAttrPair is replaced with olcDynGroupAttrPair
olcDGConfig is replaced with olcDynGroupConfig
