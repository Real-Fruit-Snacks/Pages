Dpkg::Deps::Union(3perl)         libdpkg-perl         Dpkg::Deps::Union(3perl)

NAME
       Dpkg::Deps::Union - list of unrelated dependencies

DESCRIPTION
       This class represents a list of relationships.  It inherits from
       Dpkg::Deps::Multiple.

METHODS
       $dep->output([$fh])
           The output method uses ", " to join the list of relationships.

       $dep->implies($other_dep)
       $dep->get_evaluation($other_dep)
           These methods are not meaningful for this object and always return
           undef.

       $dep->simplify_deps($facts)
           The simplification is done to generate an union of all the
           relationships.  It uses $simple_dep->merge_union($other_dep) to get
           its job done.

CHANGES
