AE(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual AE(4)

NAME

ae &mdash;
Attansic/Atheros L2 FastEthernet controller driver

SYNOPSIS

To compile this driver into the
kernel, place the following lines in your kernel
configuration file:

device
miibus 
device ae

Alternatively,
to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following line in loader.conf(5):

if_ae_load="YES"

DEPRECATION NOTICE

The ae driver is not
present in FreeBSD 13.0 and later. See
https://github.com/freebsd/fcp/blob/master/fcp-0101.md for
more information.

DESCRIPTION

The ae device driver
provides support for Attansic/Atheros L2 PCIe FastEthernet
controllers.

The controller
supports hardware Ethernet checksum processing, hardware
VLAN tag stripping/insertion and an interrupt moderation
mechanism. Attansic L2 also features a 64-bit multicast hash
filter.

The ae
driver supports the following media types:

autoselect

Enable
autoselection of the media type and options. The user can
manually override the autoselected mode by adding media
options to rc.conf(5).

10baseT/UTP

Select 10Mbps
operation.

100baseTX

Set 100Mbps
(FastEthernet) operation.

The ae
driver provides support for the following media options:

full-duplex

Force full
duplex operation.

half-duplex

Force half
duplex operation.

For more
information on configuring this device, see ifconfig(8).

HARDWARE

The ae driver supports
Attansic/Atheros L2 PCIe FastEthernet controllers, and is
known to support the following hardware:

&bull;

ASUS EeePC 701

&bull;

ASUS EeePC 900

Other hardware
may or may not work with this driver.

LOADER TUNABLES

Tunables can be set at the
loader(8) prompt before booting the kernel or stored in
loader.conf(5).

hw.ae.msi_disable

This tunable disables MSI
support on the Ethernet hardware. The default value is
0.

SYSCTL VARIABLES

The ae driver collects a
number of useful MAC counter during the work. The statistics
is available via the dev.ae.%d.stats sysctl(8) tree,
where %d corresponds to the controller number.

DIAGNOSTICS

ae%d: watchdog
timeout.  The device has stopped responding to the
network, or there is a problem with the network connection
(cable).

ae%d: reset
timeout.  The card reset operation has been timed
out.

ae%d:
Generating random ethernet address.  No valid
Ethernet address was found in the controller NVRAM and
registers. Random locally administered address with ASUS OUI
identifier will be used instead.

HISTORY

The ae driver and this
manual page was written by Stanislav Sedov
stas [AT] FreeBSD.org>. It first appeared in
FreeBSD 7.1.

BUGS

The Attansic L2 FastEthernet
controller supports DMA but does not use a descriptor based
transfer mechanism via scatter-gather DMA. Thus the data
should be copied to/from the controller memory on each
transmit/receive. Furthermore, a lot of data alignment
restrictions apply. This may introduce a high CPU load on
systems with heavy network activity. Luckily enough this
should not be a problem on modern hardware as L2 does not
support speeds faster than 100Mbps.
