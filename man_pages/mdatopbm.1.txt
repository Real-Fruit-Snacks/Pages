DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

mdatopbm
reads a MicroDesign file as input and Produces a PBM image
as output.

If you
don’t specify mdafile, mdatopbm takes
its input from Standard Input.

OPTIONS

In addition to
the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most
notably -quiet, see
 Common Options ),
mdatopbm recognizes the following command line
options:

-d

Double the height of the output file, to compensate for
the aspect ratio used in MicroDesign files.

-i

Invert the colors used.

--

End of options (use this if the filename starts with
"-") 

The program
also accepts option -a for historical reasons, for

the same meaning as the Netpbm common option
-plain.
