NAME

sssd-krb5 -
SSSD Kerberos provider

DESCRIPTION

This manual
page describes the configuration of the Kerberos 5
authentication backend for sssd(8). For a detailed
syntax reference, please refer to the &ldquo;FILE
FORMAT&rdquo; section of the sssd.conf(5) manual
page.

The Kerberos 5
authentication backend contains auth and chpass providers.
It must be paired with an identity provider in order to
function properly (for example, id_provider = ldap). Some
information required by the Kerberos 5 authentication
backend must be provided by the identity provider, such as
the user's Kerberos Principal Name (UPN). The configuration
of the identity provider should have an entry to specify the
UPN. Please refer to the man page for the applicable
identity provider for details on how to configure this.

This backend
also provides access control based on the .k5login file in
the home directory of the user. See k5login(5) for
more details. Please note that an empty .k5login file will
deny all access to this user. To activate this feature, use
'access_provider = krb5' in your SSSD configuration.

In the case
where the UPN is not available in the identity backend,
sssd will construct a UPN using the format
username@krb5_realm.

CONFIGURATION OPTIONS

If the
auth-module krb5 is used in an SSSD domain, the following
options must be used. See the sssd.conf(5) manual
page, section &ldquo;DOMAIN SECTIONS&rdquo;, for details on
the configuration of an SSSD domain.

krb5_server,
krb5_backup_server (string)

Specifies the comma-separated
list of IP addresses or hostnames of the Kerberos servers to
which SSSD should connect, in the order of preference. For
more information on failover and server redundancy, see the
&ldquo;FAILOVER&rdquo; section. An optional port number
(preceded by a colon) may be appended to the addresses or
hostnames. If empty, service discovery is enabled; for more
information, refer to the &ldquo;SERVICE DISCOVERY&rdquo;
section.

When using
service discovery for KDC or kpasswd servers, SSSD first
searches for DNS entries that specify _udp as the protocol
and falls back to _tcp if none are found.

This option was
named &ldquo;krb5_kdcip&rdquo; in earlier releases of SSSD.
While the legacy name is recognized for the time being,
users are advised to migrate their config files to use
&ldquo;krb5_server&rdquo; instead.

krb5_realm
(string)

The name of the Kerberos realm.
This option is required and must be specified.

krb5_kpasswd,
krb5_backup_kpasswd (string)

If the change password service
is not running on the KDC, alternative servers can be
defined here. An optional port number (preceded by a colon)
may be appended to the addresses or hostnames.

For more
information on failover and server redundancy, see the
&ldquo;FAILOVER&rdquo; section. NOTE: Even if there are no
more kpasswd servers to try, the backend is not switched to
operate offline if authentication against the KDC is still
possible.

Default: Use
the KDC

krb5_ccachedir
(string)

Directory to store credential
caches. All the substitution sequences of
krb5_ccname_template can be used here, too, except %d and
%P. The directory is created as private and owned by the
user, with permissions set to 0700.

Default:
/tmp

krb5_ccname_template
(string)

Location of the user's
credential cache. Three credential cache types are currently
supported: &ldquo;FILE&rdquo;, &ldquo;DIR&rdquo; and
&ldquo;KEYRING:persistent&rdquo;. The cache can be specified
either as TYPE:RESIDUAL, or as an absolute path,
which implies the &ldquo;FILE&rdquo; type. In the template,
the following sequences are substituted:

%u

login name

%U

login UID

%p

principal name

%r

realm name

%h

home directory

%d

value of krb5_ccachedir

%P

the process ID of the SSSD
client

%%

a literal '%'

If the template
ends with 'XXXXXX' mkstemp(3) is used to create a unique
filename in a safe way.

When using
KEYRING types, the only supported mechanism is
&ldquo;KEYRING:persistent:%U&rdquo;, which uses the Linux
kernel keyring to store credentials on a per-UID basis. This
is also the recommended choice, as it is the most secure and
predictable method.

The default
value for the credential cache name is sourced from the
profile stored in the system wide krb5.conf configuration
file in the [libdefaults] section. The option name is
default_ccache_name. See krb5.conf(5)'s PARAMETER EXPANSION
paragraph for additional information on the expansion format
defined by krb5.conf.

NOTE: Please be
aware that libkrb5 ccache expansion template from
krb5.conf(5) uses different expansion sequences than
SSSD.

Default: (from
libkrb5)

krb5_keytab
(string)

The location of the keytab to
use when validating credentials obtained from KDCs.

Default: System
keytab, normally /etc/krb5.keytab

krb5_store_password_if_offline
(boolean)

Store the password of the user
if the provider is offline and use it to request a TGT when
the provider comes online again.

NOTE: this
feature is only available on Linux. Passwords stored in this
way are kept in plaintext in the kernel keyring and are
potentially accessible by the root user (with
difficulty).

Default:
false

krb5_use_fast
(string)

Enables flexible authentication
secure tunneling (FAST) for Kerberos pre-authentication. The
following options are supported:

never
use FAST. This is equivalent to not setting this option at
all.

try to
use FAST. If the server does not support FAST, continue the
authentication without it.

demand
to use FAST. The authentication fails if the server does not
require fast.

Default: not
set, i.e. FAST is not used.

NOTE: a keytab
or support for anonymous PKINIT is required to use FAST.

NOTE: SSSD
supports FAST only with MIT Kerberos version 1.8 and later.
If SSSD is used with an older version of MIT Kerberos, using
this option is a configuration error.

krb5_fast_principal
(string)

Specifies the server principal
to use for FAST.

krb5_fast_use_anonymous_pkinit
(boolean)

If set to true try to use
anonymous PKINIT instead of a keytab to get the required
credential for FAST. The krb5_fast_principal options is
ignored in this case.

Default:
false

krb5_use_kdcinfo
(boolean)

Specifies if the SSSD should
instruct the Kerberos libraries what realm and which KDCs to
use. This option is on by default, if you disable it, you
need to configure the Kerberos library using the
krb5.conf(5) configuration file.

See the
sssd_krb5_locator_plugin(8) manual page for more
information on the locator plugin.

Default:
true

krb5_kdcinfo_lookahead
(string)

When krb5_use_kdcinfo is set to
true, you can limit the amount of servers handed to
sssd_krb5_locator_plugin(8). This might be helpful
when there are too many servers discovered using SRV
record.

The
krb5_kdcinfo_lookahead option contains two numbers separated
by a colon. The first number represents number of primary
servers used and the second number specifies the number of
backup servers.

For example
10:0 means that up to 10 primary servers will be
handed to sssd_krb5_locator_plugin(8) but no backup
servers.

Default:
3:1

krb5_use_enterprise_principal
(boolean)

Specifies if the user principal
should be treated as enterprise principal. See section 5 of
RFC 6806 for more details about enterprise principals.

Default: false
(AD provider: true)

The IPA
provider will set to option to 'true' if it detects that the
server is capable of handling enterprise principals and the
option is not set explicitly in the config file.

krb5_use_subdomain_realm
(boolean)

Specifies to use subdomains
realms for the authentication of users from trusted domains.
This option can be set to 'true' if enterprise principals
are used with upnSuffixes which are not known on the parent
domain KDCs. If the option is set to 'true' SSSD will try to
send the request directly to a KDC of the trusted domain the
user is coming from.

Default:
false

krb5_map_user
(string)

The list of mappings is given
as a comma-separated list of pairs
&ldquo;username:primary&rdquo; where &ldquo;username&rdquo;
is a UNIX user name and &ldquo;primary&rdquo; is a user part
of a kerberos principal. This mapping is used when user is
authenticating using &ldquo;auth_provider = krb5&rdquo;.

example:

krb5_realm =
REALM 
krb5_map_user = joe:juser,dick:richard

&ldquo;joe&rdquo;
and &ldquo;dick&rdquo; are UNIX user names and
&ldquo;juser&rdquo; and &ldquo;richard&rdquo; are primaries
of kerberos principals. For user &ldquo;joe&rdquo; resp.
&ldquo;dick&rdquo; SSSD will try to kinit as
&ldquo;juser@REALM&rdquo; resp.
&ldquo;richard@REALM&rdquo;.

Default: not
set

krb5_auth_timeout
(integer)

Timeout in seconds after an
online authentication request or change password request is
aborted. If possible, the authentication request is
continued offline.

Default: 6

krb5_validate
(boolean)

Verify with the help of
krb5_keytab that the TGT obtained has not been spoofed. The
keytab is checked for entries sequentially, and the first
entry with a matching realm is used for validation. If no
entry matches the realm, the last entry in the keytab is
used. This process can be used to validate environments
using cross-realm trust by placing the appropriate keytab
entry as the last entry or the only entry in the keytab
file.

Default: false
(IPA and AD provider: true)

Please note
that the ticket validation is the first step when checking
the PAC (see 'pac_check' in the sssd.conf(5) manual
page for details). If ticket validation is disabled the PAC
checks will be skipped as well.

krb5_renewable_lifetime
(string)

Request a renewable ticket with
a total lifetime, given as an integer immediately followed
by a time unit:

s for
seconds

m for
minutes

h for
hours

d for
days.

If there is no
unit given, s is assumed.

NOTE: It is not
possible to mix units. To set the renewable lifetime to one
and a half hours, use '90m' instead of '1h30m'.

Default: not
set, i.e. the TGT is not renewable

krb5_lifetime
(string)

Request ticket with a lifetime,
given as an integer immediately followed by a time unit:

s for
seconds

m for
minutes

h for
hours

d for
days.

If there is no
unit given s is assumed.

NOTE: It is not
possible to mix units. To set the lifetime to one and a half
hours please use '90m' instead of '1h30m'.

Default: not
set, i.e. the default ticket lifetime configured on the
KDC.

krb5_renew_interval
(string)

The time in seconds between two
checks if the TGT should be renewed. TGTs are renewed if
about half of their lifetime is exceeded, given as an
integer immediately followed by a time unit:

s for
seconds

m for
minutes

h for
hours

d for
days.

If there is no
unit given, s is assumed.

NOTE: It is not
possible to mix units. To set the renewable lifetime to one
and a half hours, use '90m' instead of '1h30m'.

If this option
is not set or is 0 the automatic renewal is disabled.

Default: not
set

krb5_canonicalize
(boolean)

Specifies if the host and user
principal should be canonicalized. This feature is available
with MIT Kerberos 1.7 and later versions.

Default:
false

FAILOVER

The failover
feature allows back ends to automatically switch to a
different server if the current server fails.

Failover
Syntax 
The list of servers is given as a comma-separated list; any
number of spaces is allowed around the comma. The servers
are listed in order of preference. The list can contain any
number of servers.

For each
failover-enabled config option, two variants exist:
primary and backup. The idea is that servers
in the primary list are preferred and backup servers are
only searched if no primary servers can be reached. If a
backup server is selected, a timeout of 31 seconds is set.
After this timeout SSSD will periodically try to reconnect
to one of the primary servers. If it succeeds, it will
replace the current active (backup) server.

The Failover
Mechanism 
The failover mechanism distinguishes between a machine and a
service. The back end first tries to resolve the hostname of
a given machine; if this resolution attempt fails, the
machine is considered offline. No further attempts are made
to connect to this machine for any other service. If the
resolution attempt succeeds, the back end tries to connect
to a service on this machine. If the service connection
attempt fails, then only this particular service is
considered offline and the back end automatically switches
over to the next service. The machine is still considered
online and might still be tried for another service.

Further
connection attempts are made to machines or services marked
as offline after a specified period of time; this is
currently hard coded to 30 seconds.

If there are no
more machines to try, the back end as a whole switches to
offline mode, and then attempts to reconnect every 30
seconds.

Failover
time outs and tuning 
Resolving a server to connect to can be as simple as running
a single DNS query or can involve several steps, such as
finding the correct site or trying out multiple host names
in case some of the configured servers are not reachable.
The more complex scenarios can take some time and SSSD needs
to balance between providing enough time to finish the
resolution process but on the other hand, not trying for too
long before falling back to offline mode. If the SSSD debug
logs show that the server resolution is timing out before a
live server is contacted, you can consider changing the time
outs.

This section
lists the available tunables. Please refer to their
description in the sssd.conf(5), manual page.

dns_resolver_server_timeout

Time in milliseconds that sets
how long would SSSD talk to a single DNS server before
trying next one.

Default:
1000

dns_resolver_op_timeout

Time in seconds to tell how
long would SSSD try to resolve single DNS query (e.g.
resolution of a hostname or an SRV record) before trying the
next hostname or discovery domain.

Default: 3

dns_resolver_timeout

How long would SSSD try to
resolve a failover service. This service resolution
internally might include several steps, such as resolving
DNS SRV queries or locating the site.

Default: 6

For LDAP-based
providers, the resolve operation is performed as part of an
LDAP connection operation. Therefore, also the
&ldquo;ldap_opt_timeout&rdquo; timeout should be set to a
larger value than &ldquo;dns_resolver_timeout&rdquo; which
in turn should be set to a larger value than
&ldquo;dns_resolver_op_timeout&rdquo; which should be larger
than &ldquo;dns_resolver_server_timeout&rdquo;.

SERVICE DISCOVERY

The service
discovery feature allows back ends to automatically find the
appropriate servers to connect to using a special DNS query.
This feature is not supported for backup servers.

Configuration

If no servers are specified, the back end automatically uses
service discovery to try to find a server. Optionally, the
user may choose to use both fixed server addresses and
service discovery by inserting a special keyword,
&ldquo;_srv_&rdquo;, in the list of servers. The order of
preference is maintained. This feature is useful if, for
example, the user prefers to use service discovery whenever
possible, and fall back to a specific server when no servers
can be discovered using DNS.

The domain
name 
Please refer to the &ldquo;dns_discovery_domain&rdquo;
parameter in the sssd.conf(5) manual page for more
details.

The
protocol 
The queries usually specify _tcp as the protocol. Exceptions
are documented in respective option description.

refer to RFC 2782.
