NAME

sq encrypt -
Encrypt a message

SYNOPSIS

sq
encrypt [OPTIONS] FILE

DESCRIPTION

Encrypt a
message.

Encrypt a
message for any number of recipients and with any number of
passwords, optionally signing the message in the
process.

The converse
operation is ’sq decrypt’.

’sq
encrypt’ respects the reference time set by the
top-level ’--time’ argument. It uses the
reference time when selecting encryption keys, and it sets
the signature’s creation time to the reference
time.

OPTIONS

Subcommand
options 
-B, --binary

Emit binary data

--compression=KIND

Select compression scheme to
use

--encrypt-for=PURPOSE

Select what kind of keys are
considered for encryption. ’transport’ selects
subkeys marked as suitable for transport encryption,
’storage’ selects those for encrypting data at
rest, and ’universal’ selects all
encryption-capable subkeys.

-o,
--output=FILE

Write to FILE or stdout if
omitted

--private-key-store=KEY_STORE

Provide parameters for private
key store

--recipient-cert=FINGERPRINT|KEYID

Encrypt to the named
certificates

--recipient-email=EMAIL

Encrypt to all certificates
that can be authenticated for the specified email
address

--recipient-file=CERT_RING_FILE

Encrypt to all certificates in
CERT_RING_FILE

--recipient-userid=USERID

Encrypt to all certificates
that can be authenticated for the specified User ID

-s,
--symmetric

Prompt to add a password to
encrypt with. When using this option, the user is asked to
provide a password, which is used to encrypt the message.
This option can be provided more than once to provide more
than one password. The encrypted data can afterwards be
decrypted with either one of the recipient’s keys, or
one of the provided passwords.

--set-metadata-filename

Set the filename of the
encrypted file as metadata. Do note, that this metadata is
not signed and as such relying on it - on sender or receiver
side - is generally considered dangerous.

--set-metadata-time=TIME

Set time for encrypted file as
metadata. Allows setting TIME either as ISO 8601 formatted
string or by providing custom keywords. With
’none’, the metadata is not set. With
’file-creation’, the metadata is set to the
file’s creation timestamp. With
’file-modification’, the metadata is set to the
file’s last modification timestamp. With
’message-creation’, the metadata is set to the
creation timestamp of the message for which the metadata is
added. Do note, that this metadata is not signed and as such
relying on it - on sender or receiver side - is generally
considered dangerous.

--signer-file=KEY_FILE

Sign the message using the key
in KEY_FILE

--signer-key=KEYID|FINGERPRINT

Sign the message using the
specified key on the key store

--use-expired-subkey

If a certificate has only
expired encryption-capable subkeys, fall back to using the
one that expired last

FILE

Read from FILE or stdin if omitted

Global
options 
See sq(1) for a description of the global
options.
