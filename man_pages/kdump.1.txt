KDUMP(1) BSD General Commands Manual KDUMP(1)

NAME

kdump &mdash; display
kernel trace data

SYNOPSIS

kdump
[&minus;dnlRT] [&minus;f file]
[&minus;m maxdata]
[&minus;t [cnisuw]]

DESCRIPTION

The kdump command
displays the kernel trace files produced with ktrace(1) in
human readable format. By default, the file
ktrace.out in the current directory is displayed.

The options are
as follows:

&minus;d

Display all
numbers in decimal.

&minus;f file

Display the
specified file instead of ktrace.out.

&minus;l

Loop reading
the trace file, once the end-of-file is reached, waiting for
more data.

&minus;m
maxdata

Display at most
maxdata bytes when decoding I/O.

&minus;n

Suppress ad hoc
translations. Normally kdump tries to decode many
system calls into a more human readable format. For example,
ioctl(2) values are replaced with the macro name and
errno values are replaced with the strerror(3)
string. Suppressing this feature yields a more consistent
output format and is easily amenable to further
processing.

&minus;R

Display
relative timestamps (time since previous entry).

&minus;T

Display
absolute timestamps for each entry (seconds since
epoch).

&minus;t
cnisuw

See the
&minus;t option of ktrace(1).
