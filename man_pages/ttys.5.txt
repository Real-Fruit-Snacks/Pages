NAME

ttys &mdash; terminal
initialization information

DESCRIPTION

The file ttys contains
information that is used by various routines to initialize
and control the use of terminal special files. This
information is read with the getttyent(3) library routines.
There is one line in the ttys file per special device
file. Fields are separated by tabs and/or spaces. Fields
comprised of more than one word should be enclosed in double
quotes (&rsquo;&rsquo;"&rsquo;&rsquo;). Blank lines and
comments may appear anywhere in the file; comments are
delimited by hash marks (&rsquo;&rsquo;#&rsquo;&rsquo;) and
new lines. Any unspecified fields will default to null.

The first field
is normally the name of the terminal special file as it is
found in /dev. However, it can be any arbitrary
string when the associated command is not related to a
tty.

The second field
of the file is the command to execute for the line, usually
getty(8), which initializes and opens the line, setting the
speed, waiting for a user name and executing the login(1)
program. It can be, however, any desired command, for
example the start up for a window system terminal emulator
or some other daemon process, and can contain multiple words
if quoted.

The third field
is the type of terminal usually connected to that tty line,
normally the one found in the termcap(5) data base file. The
environment variable TERM is initialized with the value by
either getty(8) or login(1).

The remaining
fields set flags in the ty_status entry (see
getttyent(3)), specify a window system process that init(8)
will maintain for the terminal line, optionally determine
the type of tty (whether dialin, network or otherwise), or
specify a tty group name that allows the login class
database (see login.conf(5)) to refer to many ttys as a
group, to selectively allow or deny access or enable or
disable accounting facilities for ttys as a group.

As flag values,
the strings &rsquo;&rsquo;on&rsquo;&rsquo; and
&rsquo;&rsquo;off&rsquo;&rsquo; specify that init(8) should
(should not) execute the command given in the second field,
while &rsquo;&rsquo;secure&rsquo;&rsquo; (if
&rsquo;&rsquo;on&rsquo;&rsquo; is also specified) allows
users with a uid of 0 to login on this line. The flag
&rsquo;&rsquo;dialin&rsquo;&rsquo; indicates that a tty
entry describes a dialin line, and
&rsquo;&rsquo;network&rsquo;&rsquo; indicates that a tty
entry provides a network connection. Either of these strings
may also be specified in the terminal type field. The string
&rsquo;&rsquo;window=&rsquo;&rsquo; may be followed by a
quoted command string which init(8) will execute
before starting the command specified by the second
field.

The string
&rsquo;&rsquo;group=&rsquo;&rsquo; may be followed by a
group name comprised of alphanumeric characters that can be
used by login.conf(5) to refer to many tty lines as a group
to enable or disable access and accounting facilities. If no
group is specified, then the tty becomes a member of the
group "none". For backwards compatibility, the
&rsquo;&rsquo;group=&rsquo;&rsquo; should appear last on the
line, immediately before the optional comment.

Both the second
field and any command specified with
&rsquo;&rsquo;window=&rsquo;&rsquo; will be split into words
and executed using execve(2). Words are separated by any
combinations of tabs and spaces. Arguments containing
whitespace should be enclosed in single quotes (&rsquo;).
Note that no shell-style globbing or other variable
substitution occurs.
