NAME

tblcvt -
troffcvt preprocessor to convert tbl-format
tables

SYNTAX

tblcvt [
file ] ...

DESCRIPTION

tblcvt
examines troff input for tables that would normally
be processed by the tbl program, i.e., for lines
bracketed by the .TS table start and .TE table
end requests. tblcvt parses table specifications and
data and converts it to a form that troffcvt can more
easily handle. This is useful for document processing
commands that use troffcvt, since troffcvt has
knowledge only of the troff input language, and knows
nothing of the tbl input language.

tblcvt
is a direct replacement for tbl. Suppose you would
normally process a document using tbl and
troff (or groff, etc.) like this:

% tbl file ... | troff
...

To format the document using
tblcvt and troffcvt, use a command like
this:

% tblcvt file ... |
troffcvt ...

Actually, it&rsquo;s more
likely that you&rsquo;ll be using one of the troffcvt
front ends such as troff2html than that you&rsquo;ll
be using troffcvt directly. troffcvt in the
preceding command may be replaced by the name of the front
end:

% tblcvt file ... |
troff2html ...

If it seems that
troffcvt or a front end are not reading the output
from tblcvt , specify - after the option list
to explicitly tell them to read the standard input after
processing their other options:

% tblcvt file ... |
troffcvt ... - 
% tblcvt file ... | troff2html ... -

DIAGNOSTICS

Diagnostic
messages are written in this format:

tblcvt:line l
(table t, section s):
message...

This indicates that a problem
was detected at line number l, and that tblcvt
considers the line to be part of table number t and
section s within the table. Section numbers start at
one and are incremented for each .T& request that
occurs within a table specification.

BUGS

For the most
part, tblcvt assumes your tables make sense, i.e.,
are legal according to the tbl input language.
tblcvt may complain about malformed table constructs
(if it detects them), but it may also get confused by them
and generate garbage output.

tblcvt
generates troff output that uses long request names,
so you can&rsquo;t use compatibility mode -C (
option) with troffcvt or a troffcvt front
end.

tblcvt
doesn&rsquo;t support vertically-spanned lines. It prints a
warning when it detects one, but the table output
won&rsquo;t be correct.
