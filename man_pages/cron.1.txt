NAME

cron −
clock daemon

SYNOPSIS

/usr/sbin/cron

DESCRIPTION

The cron
command starts a process that executes commands at specified
dates and times. Regularly scheduled commands can be
specified according to instructions found in crontab
files in the directory /var/spool/cron/crontabs.
Users can submit their own crontab file using the
crontab(1) command. Commands which are to be executed
only once may be submitted using the at(1)
command.

cron
only examines crontab or at command files
during its own process initialization phase and when the
crontab or at command is run. This reduces the
overhead of checking for new or changed files at regularly
scheduled intervals.

Since
cron never exits, it should be executed only once.
This is done routinely through /etc/rc2.d/S75cron at
system boot time. The file /etc/cron.d/FIFO is used
(among other things) as a lock file to prevent the execution
of more than one instance of cron.

cron
captures the output of the job’s stdout and
stderr streams, and, if it is non-empty, mails the
output to the user. If the job does not produce output, no
mail is sent to the user (unless the job is an at(1)
job and the -m option was specified when the job was
submitted).

cron and
at jobs will be not be executed if the user’s
account is locked. Only accounts which are not locked as
defined in shadow(4) will have their job or process
executed.

Setting cron
Defaults 
To keep a log of all actions taken by cron,
CRONLOG=YES (by default) must be specified in the
/etc/default/cron file. If CRONLOG=NO is
specified, no logging is done. Keeping the log is a user
configurable option since cron usually creates huge
log files.

The PATH
for user cron jobs can be set using PATH= in
/etc/default/cron. The PATH for root
cron jobs can be set using SUPATH= in
/etc/default/cron. The security implications of
setting PATH and SUPATH should be carefully
considered.

Example
/etc/default/cron file:

CRONLOG=YES

PATH=/usr/bin:/usr/ucb:

This example
enables logging and sets the default PATH used by
non-root jobs to /usr/bin:/usr/ucb:. Root jobs will
continue to use /usr/sbin:/usr/bin.

/etc/cron.d/logchecker
is a script that checks to see if the log file has exceeded
the system ulimit. If so, the log file is moved to
/var/cron/olog.
