NAME

niscat &minus;
display NIS+ tables and objects

SYNOPSIS

niscat
[-AhLMv] [-s sep]
tablename...

niscat
[-ALMP] -o name...

DESCRIPTION

In the first
synopsis, niscat displays the contents of the
NIS+ tables named by tablename. In the second
synopsis, it displays the internal representation of the
NIS+ objects named by name.

Columns without
values in the table are displayed by two adjacent separator
characters.

OPTIONS

The following
options are supported:

-A

Display the data within the table and all of the data in
tables in the initial table&rsquo;s concatenation path.

-h

Display the header line prior to displaying the table.
The header consists of the &rsquo;#&rsquo; (hash) character
followed by the name of each column. The column names are
separated by the table separator character.

-L

Follow links. When this option is specified, if
tablename or name names a LINK type
object, the link is followed and the object or table named
by the link is displayed.

-M

Master server only. This option specifies that the
request should be sent to the master server of the named
data. This guarantees that the most up-to-date information
is seen at the possible expense of increasing the load on
the master server and increasing the possibility of the
NIS+ server being unavailable or busy for
updates. 

-P

Follow concatenation path. This option specifies that
the request should follow the concatenation path of a table
if the initial search is unsuccessful. This option is only
useful when using an indexed name for name and the
-o option.

-v

Display binary data directly. This option displays
columns containing binary data on the standard output.
Without this option binary data is displayed as the string
*BINARY*. 

-o name

Display the internal
representation of the named NIS+ object(s). If
name is an indexed name (see nismatch(1)),
then each of the matching entry objects is displayed. This
option is used to display access rights and other attributes
of individual columns.

-s sep

This option specifies the
character to use to separate the table columns. If no
character is specified, the default separator for the table
is used.

EXAMPLES

Example 1:
Using the niscat Command

This example
displays the contents of the hosts table.

The string
*NP* is returned in those fields where the user has
insufficient access rights.

Display the
passwd.org_dir on the standard output.

example%
niscat passwd.org_dir

Display the
contents of table frodo and the contents of all
tables in its concatenation path.

example%
niscat -A frodo

Display the
entries in the table groups.org_dir as NIS+
objects. Note that the brackets are protected from the shell
by single quotes.

example%
niscat -o &rsquo;[ ]groups.org_dir&rsquo;

Display the
table object of the passwd.org_dir table.

example%
niscat -o passwd.org_dir

The previous
example displays the passwd table object and not the passwd
table. The table object include information such as the
number of columns, column type, searchable or not searchable
separator, access rights, and other defaults.

Display the
directory object for org_dir, which includes
information such as the access rights and replica
information.

example%
niscat -o org_dir

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

If this variable is set, and
the NIS+ table name is not fully qualified, each
directory specified will be searched until the table is
found (see nisdefaults(1)).

EXIT STATUS

niscat
returns the following values:

0

Successful completion

1

An error occurred.
