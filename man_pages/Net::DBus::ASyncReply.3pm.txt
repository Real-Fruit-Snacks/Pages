NAME
       Net::DBus::ASyncReply - asynchronous method reply handler

SYNOPSIS
         use Net::DBus::Annotation qw(:call);

         my $object = $service->get_object("/org/example/systemMonitor");

         # List processes & get on with other work until
         # the list is returned.
         my $asyncreply = $object->list_processes(dbus_call_async, "someuser");

         while (!$asyncreply->is_ready) {
           ... do some background work..
         }

         my $processes = $asyncreply->get_result;

DESCRIPTION
       This object provides a handler for receiving asynchronous method
       replies. An asynchronous reply object is generated when making remote
       method call with the "dbus_call_async" annotation set.

METHODS
       $asyncreply->discard_result;
           Indicates that the caller is no longer interested in receiving the
           reply & that it should be discarded. After calling this method,
           this object should not be used again.

       $asyncreply->wait_for_result;
           Blocks the caller waiting for completion of the of the asynchronous
           reply. Upon returning from this method, the result can be obtained
           with the "get_result" method.

       my $boolean = $asyncreply->is_ready;
           Returns a true value if the asynchronous reply is now complete (or
           a timeout has occurred). When this method returns true, the result
           can be obtained with the "get_result" method.

       $asyncreply->set_notify($coderef);
           Sets a notify function which will be invoked when the asynchronous
           reply finally completes. The callback will be invoked with a single
           parameter which is this object.

       my @data = $asyncreply->get_result;
           Retrieves the data associated with the asynchronous reply.  If a
           timeout occurred, then this method will throw an exception. This
           method can only be called once the reply is complete, as indicated
           by the "is_ready" method returning a true value. After calling this
           method, this object should no longer be used.
