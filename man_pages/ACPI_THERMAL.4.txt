ACPI_THERMAL(4)

NAME

acpi_thermal &mdash; ACPI
thermal management subsystem

SYNOPSIS

device acpi

DESCRIPTION

The acpi_thermal driver
provides the thermal management features of the ACPI module.
This driver has a sysctl(8) interface and a devd(8)
notification interface. The sysctls export properties of
each ACPI thermal zone object.

There can be
multiple thermal zones in a system. For example, each CPU
and the enclosure could all be separate thermal zones, each
with its own setpoints and cooling devices. Thermal zones
are numbered sequentially in the order they appear in the
AML.

The
acpi_thermal driver also activates the active cooling
system according to each thermal zone&rsquo;s setpoints.

SYSCTL VARIABLES 
hw.acpi.thermal.min_runtime

Number of seconds to continue
active cooling once started. A new active cooling level will
not be selected until this interval expires.

hw.acpi.thermal.polling_rate

Number of seconds between
polling the current temperature.

hw.acpi.thermal.user_override

If set to 1, allow user
override of various setpoints (below). The original values
for these settings are obtained from the BIOS and system
overheating and possible damage could occur if changed.
Default is 0 (no override).

hw.acpi.thermal.tz%d.active

Current active cooling system
state. If this is non-negative, the appropriate _AC%d object
is running. Set this value to the desired active cooling
level to force the corresponding fan object to the
appropriate level.

hw.acpi.thermal.tz%d.passive_cooling

If set to 1, passive cooling is
enabled. It does cooling without fans using cpufreq(4) as
the mechanism for controlling CPU speed. Default is enabled
for tz0 where it is available.

hw.acpi.thermal.tz%d.thermal_flags

Current thermal zone status.
These are bit-masked values.

hw.acpi.thermal.tz%d.temperature

Current temperature for this
zone.

hw.acpi.thermal.tz%d._PSV

Temperature to start passive
cooling by throttling down CPU, etc. This value can be
overridden by the user.

hw.acpi.thermal.tz%d._HOT

Temperature to start critical
suspend to disk (S4). This value can be overridden by the
user.

hw.acpi.thermal.tz%d._CRT

Temperature to start critical
shutdown (S5). This value can be overridden by the user.

hw.acpi.thermal.tz%d._ACx

Temperatures at which to switch
to the corresponding active cooling level. The lower the
_ACx value, the higher the cooling power.

All temperatures
are printed in Celsius. Values can be set in Celsius (by
providing a trailing "C") or Kelvin (by leaving
off any trailing letter). When setting a value by sysctl(8),
do not specify a trailing decimal (i.e., 90C instead of
90.0C).

NOTIFIES

Notifies are passed to userland
via devd(8). See /etc/devd.conf and devd.conf(5) for
examples. The acpi_thermal driver sends events with
the following attributes:

system

ACPI

subsystem

Thermal

type

The fully
qualified thermal zone object path as in the ASL.

notify

An integer
designating the event:

0x80

Current
temperature has changed.

0x81

One or more
trip points (_ACx, _PSV) have changed.

0x82

One or more
device lists (_ALx, _PSL, _TZD) have changed.

0xcc

Non-standard
notify that the system will shutdown if the temperature
stays above _CRT or _HOT for one more poll cycle.
