DESCRIPTION

prompter
is an editor front-end for nmh which allows rapid
composition of messages. This program is not normally
invoked directly by users but takes the place of an editor
and acts as an editor front-end. It operates on an RFC
822-style message draft skeleton specified by file,
normally provided by the nmh commands comp,
dist, forw, or repl.

prompter
is particularly useful when composing messages over slow
network or modem lines. It is an nmh program in that
it can have its own profile entry with switches, but it is
not invoked directly by the user. The commands comp,
dist, forw, and repl invoke
prompter as an editor, either when invoked with
-editor prompter, or by the profile entry
&ldquo;Editor: prompter&rdquo;, or when given the
command edit prompter at the &ldquo;What now?&rdquo;
prompt.

For each empty
component prompter finds in the draft, the user is
prompted for a response; A  will cause the
whole component to be left out. Otherwise, a &rsquo;\&rsquo;
preceding a  will continue the response on the
next line, allowing for multiline components. Continuation
lines must begin with a space or tab.

Each non-empty
component is copied to the draft and displayed on the
terminal.

The start of
the message body is denoted by a blank line or a line of
dashes. If the body is non-empty, the prompt, which
isn&rsquo;t written to the file, is

--------Enter
additional text

or (if
-prepend was given)

--------Enter
initial text

Message-body
typing is terminated with an end-of-file (usually CTRL-D).
With the -doteof switch, a period on a line all by
itself also signifies end-of-file. At this point control is
returned to the calling program, where the user is asked
&ldquo;What now?&rdquo;. See whatnow(1) for the valid
options to this query.

By using the
-prepend switch, the user can add type-in to the
beginning of the message body and have the rest of the body
follow. This is useful for the forw command.

By using the
-rapid switch, if the draft already contains text in
the message-body, it is not displayed on the user&rsquo;s
terminal. This is useful for low-speed terminals.

The line
editing characters for kill and erase may be specified by
the user via the arguments -kill chr and
-erase chr, where chr may be a
character; or &rsquo;\nnn&rsquo;, where &ldquo;nnn&rdquo; is
the octal value for the character.

An interrupt
(usually CTRL-C) during component typing will abort
prompter and the nmh command that invoked it.
An interrupt during message-body typing is equivalent to
CTRL-D, for historical reasons. This means that
prompter should finish up and exit.

The first
non-flag argument to prompter is taken as the name of
the draft file, and subsequent non-flag arguments are
ignored.

CONTEXT

None

HELPFUL HINTS

The
-rapid option is particularly useful with
forw, and -noprepend is useful with comp
-use.

The user may
wish to link prompter under several names (e.g.,
&ldquo;rapid&rdquo;) and give appropriate switches in the
profile entries under these names (e.g., &ldquo;rapid:
-rapid&rdquo;). This facilitates invoking prompter
differently for different nmh commands (e.g.,
&ldquo;forw: -editor rapid&rdquo;).

BUGS

prompter
uses stdio(3), so it will lose if you edit files with
nulls in them.
