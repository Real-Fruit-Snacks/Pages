GH-COMPLETION(1)               GitHub CLI manual              GH-COMPLETION(1)

NAME
       gh-completion - Generate shell completion scripts

SYNOPSIS
       gh completion -s <shell>

DESCRIPTION
       Generate shell completion scripts for GitHub CLI commands.

       When  installing  GitHub  CLI  through a package manager, it's possible
       that no additional shell configuration is necessary to gain  completion
       support.   For   Homebrew,   see  https://docs.brew.sh/Shell-Completion
       ⟨https://docs.brew.sh/Shell-Completion⟩

       If you need to set up completions manually, follow the instructions be‐
       low.  The  exact config file locations might vary based on your system.
       Make sure to restart your shell before testing whether completions  are
       working.

   bash
       First,  ensure that you install bash-completion using your package man‐
       ager.

       After, add this to your ~/.bash_profile:

              eval "$(gh completion -s bash)"

   zsh
       Generate a _gh completion script and put it somewhere in your $fpath:

              gh completion -s zsh > /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions/_gh

       Ensure that the following is present in your ~/.zshrc:

              autoload -U compinit
              compinit -i

       Zsh version 5.7 or later is recommended.

   fish
       Generate a gh.fish completion script:

              gh completion -s fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/gh.fish

   PowerShell
       Open your profile script with:

              mkdir -Path (Split-Path -Parent $profile) -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
              notepad $profile

       Add the line and save the file:

              Invoke-Expression -Command $(gh completion -s powershell | Out-String)

OPTIONS
       -s, --shell <string>
              Shell type: {bash|zsh|fish|powershell}
