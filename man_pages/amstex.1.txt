NAME

amstex -
structured text formatting and typesetting

SYNOPSIS

amstex
[first-line]

DESCRIPTION

This manual
page is not meant to be exhaustive. The complete
documentation for this version of TeX can be found in the
info file or manual Web2C: A TeX implementation.

The AmSTeX
language is described in the book The Joy of TeX.
AmSTeX is a TeX macro package, not a modification to the TeX
source program, so all the capabilities described in
tex(1) are present.

The AmSTeX
macros encourage writers to think about the content of their
documents, rather than the form. The ideal, not always
realized, is to have no formatting commands (like
&ldquo;switch to italic&rdquo; or &ldquo;skip 2
picas&rdquo;) in the document at all; instead, everything is
done by specific markup instructions:
&ldquo;emphasize&rdquo;, &ldquo;start a section&rdquo;.

For authors
more familiar with LaTeX, an AMS-supported package called
amsmath.sty is available, among others.
