NAME

eye - identity
matrix and preconditionner (rheolef-7.2)

DESCRIPTION

Following e.g.
octave, eye denotes the identity matrix.
Here, eye() is a function call that returns the identity
preconditionner as a solver(4).

The dimensions
of eye() are determined by the context. This class is
useful in the context of preconditionner interfaces: it
allows one to specify a do-nothing preconditionner. See e.g.
cg(5) for an example.
