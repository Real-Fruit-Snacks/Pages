NAME
       ppmtopj - convert a PPM image to an HP PaintJet file

SYNOPSIS
       ppmtopj

       [-gamma val]

       [-xpos val]

       [-ypos val]

       [-back {dark|lite}]

       [-rle]

       [-center]

       [-render  { none | snap | bw | dither | diffuse | monodither | monodif‐
       fuse | clusterdither | monoclusterdither }]

       [ppmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       ppmtopj reads a PPM image as input and converts it into a format  suit‐
       able to be printed by an HP PaintJet printer.

       For best results, the input file should be in 8-color RGB form; i.e. it
       should have only the 8 binary combinations of full-on and full-off pri‐
       maries.  You could convert your input to this format like this:

           pamseq 3 1 testimg.ppm >8color.pam
           pnmremap -map 8color.pam testimg.pam | ppmtopj

       Or you could use
           ppmdither -red 2 -green 2 -blue 2

OPTIONS
       In  addition  to  the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm
       (most notably -quiet, see
        Common Options ⟨index.html#commonoptions⟩ ),  ppmtopj  recognizes  the
       following command line options:

       -rle   Run length encode the image.  (This can result in larger images)

       -back  Enhance  the foreground by indicating if the background is light
              or dark compared to the foreground.

       -render alg
              Use an internal rendering algorithm (default dither).

       -gamma int
              Gamma correct the image using the integer int as  a  gamma  (de‐
              fault 0).

       -center
              Center the image to an 8.5 by 11 page

       -xpos pos
              Move by pos pixels in the x direction.

       -ypos pos
              Move by pos pixels in the y direction.
