NAME

ceph-mon - ceph
monitor daemon

SYNOPSIS

ceph-mon
-i monid [ --mon-data mondatapath ]

DESCRIPTION

ceph-mon
is the cluster monitor daemon for the Ceph distributed file
system. One or more instances of ceph-mon form a
Paxos part-time parliament cluster that provides extremely
reliable and durable storage of cluster membership,
configuration, and state.

The
mondatapath refers to a directory on a local file
system storing monitor data. It is normally specified via
the mon data option in the configuration file.

OPTIONS

-f,
--foreground

Foreground: do not daemonize
after startup (run in foreground). Do not generate a pid
file. Useful when run via ceph-run(8).

-d

Debug mode: like -f, but also send all log output
to stderr.

--setuser userorgid

Set uid after starting. If a
username is specified, the user record is looked up to get a
uid and a gid, and the gid is also set as well, unless
--setgroup is also specified.

--setgroup
grouporgid

Set gid after starting. If a
group name is specified the group record is looked up to get
a gid.

-c ceph.conf,
--conf=ceph.conf

Use ceph.conf
configuration file instead of the default
/etc/ceph/ceph.conf to determine monitor addresses
during startup.

--mkfs

Initialize the mon data directory with seed
information to form and initial ceph file system or to join
an existing monitor cluster. Three pieces of information
must be provided:

&bull;

The cluster fsid. This can come
from a monmap (--monmap ) or explicitly
via --fsid .

&bull;

A list of monitors and their addresses. This list of
monitors can come from a monmap (--monmap
), the mon host configuration value
(in ceph.conf or via -m host1,host2,...), or
(for backward compatibility) the deprecated mon addr
lines in ceph.conf. If this monitor is to be part of
the initial monitor quorum for a new Ceph cluster, then it
must be included in the initial list, matching either the
name or address of a monitor in the list. When matching by
address, either the public addr or public
subnet options may be used.

&bull;

The monitor secret key mon.. This must be
included in the keyring provided via --keyring
. 

--keyring

Specify a keyring for use with
--mkfs.

--no-config-file

Signal that we don't want to
rely on a ceph.conf, either user provided or the
default, to run the daemon. This will entail providing all
necessary options to the daemon as arguments.

AVAILABILITY

ceph-mon
is part of Ceph, a massively scalable, open-source,
distributed storage system. Please refer to the Ceph
documentation at http://ceph.com/docs for more
information.
