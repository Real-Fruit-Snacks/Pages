firewalld.lockdown-whitelist
- firewalld lockdown whitelist configuration file

SYNOPSIS

/etc/firewalld/lockdown-whitelists.xml

DESCRIPTION

The firewalld
lockdown-whitelist configuration file contains the selinux
contexts, commands, users and user ids that are white-listed
when firewalld lockdown feature is enabled (see
firewalld.conf(5) and firewall-cmd(1)).

This example
configuration file shows the structure of an
lockdown-whitelist file:

selinuxcontext"/>

commandline[*]"/> 
username|id="userid"}/>

OPTIONS

The config can
contain these tags and attributes. Some of them are
mandatory, others optional.

whitelist

The mandatory whitelist start and end tag defines the
lockdown-whitelist. This tag can only be used once in a
lockdown-whitelist configuration file. There are no
attributes for this.

selinux

Is an optional empty-element tag and can be used several
times to have more than one selinux contexts entries. A
selinux entry has exactly one attribute:

context="string"

The context is the security
(SELinux) context of a running application or service.

To get the
context of a running application use ps -e --context
and search for the application that should be
white-listed.

Warning: If the
context of an application is unconfined, then this will open
access for more than the desired application.

command

Is an optional empty-element tag and can be used several
times to have more than one command entry. A command entry
has exactly one attribute:

name="string"

The command string is a
complete command line including path and also
attributes.

If a command
entry ends with an asterisk '*', then all command lines
starting with the command will match. If the '*' is not
there the absolute command inclusive arguments must
match.

Commands for
user root and others is not always the same, the used path
depends on the use of the PATH environment
variable.

user

Is an optional empty-element tag and can be used several
times to white-list more than one user. A user entry has
exactly one attribute of these:

name="string"

The user with the name
string will be white-listed.

id="integer"

The user with the id
userid will be white-listed.
