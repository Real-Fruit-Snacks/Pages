Lintian::Processable(3)     Debian Package Checker     Lintian::Processable(3)

NAME
       Lintian::Processable -- An (abstract) object that Lintian can process

SYNOPSIS
        use Lintian::Processable;

DESCRIPTION
       Instances of this perl class are objects that Lintian can process (e.g.
       deb files).  Multiple objects can then be combined into groups, which
       Lintian will process together.

INSTANCE METHODS
       name
           Returns the name of the package.

       type
           Returns the type of package (e.g. binary, source, udeb ...)

       hints
       $proc->version
           Returns the version of the package.

       $proc->path
           Returns the path to the packaged version of actual package.  This
           path is used in case the data needs to be extracted from the
           package.

       basename
           Returns the basename of the package path.

       $proc->architecture
           Returns the architecture(s) of the package. May return multiple
           values from changes processables.  For source processables it is
           "source".

       $proc->source_name
           Returns the name of the source package.

       $proc->source_version
           Returns the version of the source package.

       $proc->tainted
           Returns a truth value if one or more fields in this Processable is
           tainted.  On a best effort basis tainted fields will be sanitized
           to less dangerous (but possibly invalid) values.

       fields
           Lintian::Deb822::Section with primary field values.

       $proc->pooldir
           Returns a reference to lab this Processable is in.

       $proc->basedir
           Returns the base directory of this package inside the lab.

       "identifier"
           Produces an identifier for this processable.  The identifier is
           based on the type, name, version and architecture of the package.

       clean_field
           Cleans a field of evil characters to prevent traversal or worse.
