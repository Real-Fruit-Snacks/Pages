NAME

send-pr &minus;
send problem report (PR) to a central support site

SYNOPSIS

send-pr
[ site ] [ &minus;f problem-report ] [
&minus;t mail-address ]

[ &minus;P ] [
&minus;L ] [ &minus;s severity ] [
&minus;V ] 
[ &minus;&minus;version ] [ &minus;c
address ] [ &minus;a file ]

DESCRIPTION

send-pr
is a tool used to submit problem reports (PRs) to a
central support site. In most cases the correct site
will be the default. This argument indicates the support
site which is responsible for the category of problem
involved. Some sites may use a local address as a default.
site values are defined by using the
aliases(5).

send-pr
invokes an editor on a problem report template (after trying
to fill in some fields with reasonable default values). When
you exit the editor, send-pr sends the completed form
to the Problem Report Management System
(GNATS) at a central support site. At the support
site, the PR is assigned a unique number and is stored in
the GNATS database according to its category and
submitter-id. GNATS automatically replies with an
acknowledgement, citing the category and the PR number.

To ensure that
a PR is handled promptly, it should contain one of the
available categories to identify the problem area.
(Use &rsquo;send-pr -L&rsquo; to see a list of
categories.)

The more
precise your problem description and the more complete your
information, the faster your support team can solve your
problems.

OPTIONS

&minus;f
problem-report

specify a file
(problem-report) which already contains a complete
problem report. send-pr sends the contents of the
file without invoking the editor. If the value for
problem-report is &rsquo;&minus;&rsquo;, then
send-pr reads from standard input.

&minus;s
severity

Give the problem report the
severity severity.

&minus;t
mail-address

Change mail address at the
support site for problem reports. The default
mail-address is the address used for the default
site. Use the site argument rather than this
option in nearly all cases.

&minus;c
address

Put address in the
Cc: header of the message.

&minus;a file

Copy the specified file
into the Fix: section. Binary files are
uuencoded.

&minus;P

print the form specified by the environment variable
PR_FORM on standard output. If PR_FORM is not
set, print the standard blank PR template. No mail is
sent. 

&minus;L

print the list of available categories. No mail is
sent. 

&minus;V

Display the send-pr version number. This may also
be specified as &minus;&minus;version.

Note: use
send-pr to submit problem reports rather than mailing
them directly. Using both the template and send-pr
itself will help ensure all necessary information will reach
the support site.

ENVIRONMENT

The environment
variable EDITOR specifies the editor to invoke on the
template. 
default: vi

If the
environment variable MAIL_AGENT is set, its value is
used as the path + command line arguments of the executable
to be invoked for sending the problem report (which will be
provided via standard input). 
This can be useful if you either use a MTA other than
sendmail or need to provide additional parameters, such as
the envelope sender on machines without a valid FQDN. 
Default value: /usr/sbin/sendmail -oi -t

If the
environment variable PR_FORM is set, then its value
is used as the file name of the template for your
problem-report editing session. You can use this to start
with a partially completed form (for example, a form with
the identification fields already completed).

HOW TO FILL OUT A PROBLEM REPORT

Problem reports
have to be in a particular form so that a program can easily
manage them. Please remember the following guidelines:

&bull;

describe only one problem
with each problem report.

&bull;

For follow-up mail, use the same subject line as the one
in the automatic acknowledgement. It consists of category,
PR number and the original synopsis line. This allows the
support site to relate several mail messages to a particular
PR and to record them automatically.

&bull;

Please try to be as accurate as possible in the subject
and/or synopsis line.

&bull;

The subject and the synopsis line are not confidential.
This is because open-bugs lists are compiled from them.
Avoid confidential information there.

See the GNU
Info file send-pr.info or the document
Reporting Problems With send-pr for detailed
information on reporting problems

HOW TO SUBMIT TEST CASES, CODE, ETC.

Submit small
code samples with the PR. Contact the support site for
instructions on submitting larger test cases and problematic
source code.

FILES

/tmp/p$$ copy
of PR used in editing session 
/tmp/pf$$ copy of empty PR form, for testing purposes 
/tmp/pbad$$ file for rejected PRs

EMACS USER INTERFACE

An Emacs user
interface for send-pr with completion of field values
is part of the send-pr distribution (invoked with
M-x send-pr). See the file send-pr.info or the
ASCII file INSTALL in the top level directory of the
distribution for configuration and installation information.
The Emacs LISP template file is send-pr-el.in and is
installed as send-pr.el.
