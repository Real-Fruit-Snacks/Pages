NAME

nbdkit-luks-filter
- read and write LUKS-encrypted disks and partitions

SYNOPSIS

nbdkit file
encrypted-disk.img --filter=luks passphrase=+/tmp/secret

DESCRIPTION

"nbdkit-luks-filter"
is a filter for nbdkit(1) which transparently opens a
LUKS-encrypted disk image. LUKS ("Linux Unified Key
Setup") is the Full Disk Encryption (FDE) system
commonly used by Linux systems. This filter is compatible
with LUKSv1 as implemented by the Linux kernel (dm_crypt),
and by qemu.

You can place
this filter on top of nbdkit-file-plugin(1) to
decrypt a local file:

nbdkit file
encrypted-disk.img --filter=luks passphrase=+/tmp/secret

If LUKS is
present inside a partition in the disk image then you will
have to combine this filter with
nbdkit-partition-filter(1). The order of the filters
is important:

nbdkit file
encrypted-disk.img \ 
--filter=luks passphrase=+/tmp/secret \ 
--filter=partition partition=1

This filter
also works on top of other plugins such as
nbdkit-curl-plugin(1):

nbdkit curl
https://example.com/encrypted-disk.img \ 
--filter=luks passphrase=+/tmp/secret

The web server
sees only the encrypted data. Without knowing the
passphrase, the web server cannot access the decrypted disk.
Only encrypted data is sent over the HTTP connection. nbdkit
itself will serve unencrypted disk data over the NBD
connection (if this is a problem see nbdkit-tls(1),
or use a Unix domain socket -U).

The passphrase
can be stored in a file (as shown), passed directly on the
command line (insecure), entered interactively, or passed to
nbdkit over a file descriptor.

This filter can
read and write LUKSv1. It cannot create disks, change
passphrases, add keyslots, etc. To do that, you can use
ordinary Linux tools like cryptsetup(8). Note you
must force LUKSv1 (eg. using cryptsetup --type
luks1). qemu-img(1) can also create compatible
disk images:

qemu-img create
-f luks \ 
--object secret,data=SECRET,id=sec0 \ 
-o key-secret=sec0 \ 
encrypted-disk.img 1G

PARAMETERS

passphrase=SECRET

Use the secret passphrase when
decrypting the disk.

Note that
passing this on the command line is not secure on shared
machines.

passphrase=-

Ask for the passphrase
(interactively) when nbdkit starts up.

passphrase=+FILENAME

Read the passphrase from the
named file. This is a secure method to supply a passphrase,
as long as you set the permissions on the file
appropriately.

passphrase=-FD

Read the passphrase from file
descriptor number "FD", inherited from the parent
process when nbdkit starts up. This is also a secure method
to supply a passphrase.

FILES

Use
"nbdkit --dump-config" to find the location of
$filterdir.
