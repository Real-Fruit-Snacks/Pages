NAME
       sirikali -- manage user encrypted volumes

SYNOPSIS
       sirikali [options]

DESCRIPTION
       sirikali  provides  a  graphical  user interface for managing encrypted
       volumes for a user.

       The actual mounting/encryption process is managed by  another  service.
       The  supported  services are CryFS, EncFS, GocryptFS, and SecureFS.  At
       least one of these services must be installed.

       Encrypted volumes are created using the "Create Volume" menu.  The  en‐
       crypted  data is stored at the "Volume Path".  For normal password pro‐
       tection, use the "Key" option.

       To unmount a volume, click on the volume path and select 'Unmount'.

       To mount an existing volume, select "Mount Volume", select the directo‐
       ry containing the encrypted data, and enter the key information.

       Options:

       -d dir Path to where a volume to be auto unlocked/mounted is located.

       -m tool
              Tool  to  use  to  open  a  default file manager(default tool is
              xdg-open).

       -e     Start the application without showing the GUI.

       -b backend
              A name of a backend to retrieve a password from when a volume is
              open from CLI.  Supported backends are: "internal","stdin","key‐
              file","kwallet" and "libsecret".  The  first  three  are  always
              present but the rest are compile time dependencies.

              "internal"  option  causes  SiriKali to read password from lxqt-
              wallet internal backend.

              "stdin" option causes SiriKali to read the password  from  stan‐
              dard input.

              "keyfile"  option  causes  SiriKali  to read the password from a
              file.

              "libsecret" option causes SiriKali to read password  from  lxqt-
              wallet libsecret backend.

              "kwallet" option causes SiriKali to read password from lxqt-wal‐
              let kwallet backend.

       -k val When opening a volume from CLI,a value of  "rw"  will  open  the
              volume  in read mode and a value of "ro" will open the volume in
              read only mode.

       -z path
              Full path of the mount point to  be  used  when  the  volume  is
              opened from CLI.  This option is optional.

              CLI.

       -i min Set inactivity timeout(in minutes) to dismount the  volume  when
              mounted from CLI.

       -o val Set mount options when mounting a volume from CLI.

       -u path
              Unmount volume.

       -p     Print a list of unlocked volumes.

       -f path
              Path to keyfile.
