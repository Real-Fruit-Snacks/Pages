NAME

axlisten -
monitor AX.25 traffic

SYNOPSIS

axlisten
[-8] [-a] [-c] [-h] [-i] [-p port] [-r] [-t..] [-v]

DESCRIPTION

Axlisten
uses SOCK_PACKET facilities to provide a network monitor of
all AX.25 traffic heard by the system. Since KISS is
implicitly promiscuous no special driver configurations are
needed.

This version
displays standard AX.25, PE1CHL extended AX.25, NET/ROM,
Rose, ARP, IP, ICMP, TCP and UDP. It also displays IP, TCP,
ICMP, TCP and UDP encapsulated within NET/ROM frames. The
program also displays AX.25 and IP encapsulated within an IP
frame, but see RFC1326 for reasons not to do so.

Axlisten
makes an attempt at decoding some of the more common routing
protocols. RSPF and RIP (both &ldquo;normal&rdquo; and
G8BPQs RIP98) are traced. JNOS style NET/ROM node polls are
also displayed.

Axlisten
can use colors to make the output more readable. The ncurses
library is used to accomplish this. Color support
defaults to being disabled, and the -c parameter
is used to enable it.

OPTIONS

-8

Indicates that the terminal is
capable of printing 8-bit characters. This parameter is
required for the -i parameter to work.

-a

Allow for the monitoring of outgoing frames as well as
incoming ones.

-c

Enable color support.

-h

Dump the data portion of the packet in both hexadecimal
and ASCII. The default is to display data as ASCII only.

-i

Map IBM codepage 437 characters 128-158 to their
ISO-Latin-1 equivalents. This is a hack for scandinavian
users. This parameter is only valid when used with the -8
and -c parameters.

-p port

Monitor only those frames received on a particular port,
by default all AX.25 devices are monitored.

-r

Dump the data portion in a "readable" fashion,
which is more suitable for tracing plaintext AX.25 traffic.
CR-LF conversion is done.

-t

Don&rsquo;t print a timestamp on each dump line.

-tt

Print an unformatted timestamp on each dump line.

-ttt

Print a delta (micro-second resolution) between current
and previous line on each dump line.

-tttt

Print a timestamp in default format proceeded by date on
each dump line.

-ttttt

Print a delta (micro-second resolution) between current
and first line on each dump line.

-v

Display the version.

BUGS

Axlisten
does not validate the checksums of frames that support them
(ie IP), therefore corrupt frames will be displayed with
bogus values. The MSS of a TCP frame that contains that
option is not displayed.
