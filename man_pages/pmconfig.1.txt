NAME

pmconfig
- Performance Co-Pilot configuration parameters

SYNOPSIS

$PCP_BINADM_DIR/pmconfig
[-alLs?] [name ...]

DESCRIPTION

pmconfig
displays the values for some or all configuration parameters
of the local Performance Co-Pilot toolkit installation.

OPTIONS

The available
command line options are: 
-a, --all

Reports all configuration
parameters in the default format.

-l, --list

Synonym for the -a
option, reports the same (default) format.

-L, --library

This option changes the default
reporting mode so that the capabilities of the PCP library
are reported, rather than the PCP environment.

-s, --shell

An output format suitable for
sourcing in shell scripts which ensures configuration
information is quoted and preceded by an export statement.
When not reporting the library capabilities, this mode will
produce a statement that does not override an existing
setting in the environment for PCP configuration
variables.

-?, --help

Display usage message and
exit.

In the default
operating mode, pmconfig is often used in conjunction
with the $PCP_DIR environment variable to setup
scripts running under the Windows operating system, where
the filesystem hierarchy differs greatly to the of
Linux/UNIX-based operating systems.

PCP ENVIRONMENT

Environment
variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On
each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains
the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).
