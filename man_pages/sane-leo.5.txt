sane-leo(5)              SANE Scanner Access Now Easy              sane-leo(5)

NAME
       sane-leo - SANE backend for LEO Technologies scanners

DESCRIPTION
       The  sane-leo library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) back‐
       end that provides access to some LEO SCSI flatbed scanners. This  back‐
       end  should be considered beta-quality software! LEO scanners were also
       sold under the Across Technologies brand.

       The scanners that should work with this backend are:

                 Vendor Model           status
              ----------------------  -----------
                Across FS-1130          tested
                LEO S3                  tested

       The options the backend supports can either be selected through command
       line  options  to programs like scanimage(1) or through GUI elements in
       xscanimage(1) or xsane(1).

       If you have any strange behavior, please report to  the  backend  main‐
       tainer or to the SANE mailing list.

       Valid command line options and their syntax can be listed by using
              scanimage --help -d leo

       Scan Mode

       --mode selects  the  basic  mode  of  operation  of  the scanner. Valid
              choices are Black & White, Grayscale and  Color.   The  Black  &
              White mode is black and white only (1 bit).  Grayscale mode will
              produce 256 levels of gray (8 bits).  Color mode will produce  a
              24 bit color image.

       --resolution
              selects  the resolution for a scan. The scanner can do all reso‐
              lutions between 1 and 300, in increments of 1.

       Geometry options

       -l -t -x -y
              control the scan area: -l sets the top left x coordinate, -t the
              top left y coordinate, -x selects the width and -y the height of
              the scan area. All parameters are specified  in  millimeters  by
              default.

       Enhancement options

       --custom-gamma
              (grayscale  and  color  mode  only) allows the user to specify a
              gamma table (see the next 3 parameters).

       --red-gamma-table
              (color mode only) can be used to download a user  defined  gamma
              table for the red channel. The table must be 256 bytes long.

       --green-gamma-table
              (color  mode  only) can be used to download a user defined gamma
              table for the green channel. The table must be 256 bytes long.

       --blue-gamma-table
              (color mode only) can be used to download a user  defined  gamma
              table for the blue channel. The table must be 256 bytes long.

       --halftone
              (Black  &  White only) select the halftone mask to use. Possible
              values are Diamond, 8x8 Coarse Fatting, 8x8  Fine  Fatting,  8x8
              Bayer and 8x8 Vertical Line.

       --preview
              requests a preview scan. The resolution used for that scan is 28
              dpi and the scan area is the maximum allowed. The scan  mode  is
              user selected. The default is "no".

CONFIGURATION FILE
       The  configuration file /etc/sane.d/leo.conf supports only one informa‐
       tion: the device name to use (eg /dev/scanner).

FILES
       /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-leo.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-leo.so
              The shared library implementing this backend (present on systems
              that support dynamic loading).

ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_DEBUG_LEO
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this en‐
              vironment variable controls the debug level  for  this  backend.
              E.g.,  a  value  of 128 requests all debug output to be printed.
              Smaller levels reduce verbosity.

LIMITATIONS
       The windows TWAIN driver has many more options than this SANE  backend.
       However  they  are  only software adjustments. This backend only imple‐
       ments what the scanner can support.

BUGS
       None known.
