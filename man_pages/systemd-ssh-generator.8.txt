NAME

systemd-ssh-generator
- Generator for binding a socket-activated SSH server to
local AF_VSOCK and AF_UNIX sockets

SYNOPSIS

/usr/lib/systemd/system-generators/systemd-ssh-generator

DESCRIPTION

systemd-ssh-generator
binds a socket-activated SSH server to local AF_VSOCK
and AF_UNIX sockets under certain conditions. It only
has an effect if the sshd(8) binary is installed.
Specifically, it does the following:

&bull; If
invoked in a VM with AF_VSOCK support, a
socket-activated SSH per-connection service is bound to
AF_VSOCK port 22.

&bull; If
invoked in a container environment with a writable directory
/run/host/unix-export/ pre-mounted it binds SSH to an
AF_UNIX socket /run/host/unix-export/ssh. The
assumption is that this directory is bind mounted to the
host side as well, and can be used to connect to the
container from there. See Container
Interface
[1]
for more information about this
interface.

&bull;
A local AF_UNIX socket /run/ssh-unix-local/socket is
also bound, unconditionally. This may be used for SSH
communication from the host to itself, without involving
networking, for example to traverse security boundaries
safely and with secure authentication.

&bull;
Additional AF_UNIX and AF_VSOCK sockets are
optionally bound, based on the systemd.ssh_listen=
kernel command line option or the ssh.listen system
credential (see below).

See
systemd-ssh-proxy(1) for details on how to connect to
these sockets via the ssh client.

The
ssh.authorized_keys.root credential can be used to
allow specific public keys to log in over SSH. See
systemd.systemd-credentials(7) for more
information.

The
generator will use a packaged sshd@.service service template
file if one exists, and otherwise generate a suitable
service template file.

systemd-ssh-generator
implements systemd.generator(7).

KERNEL COMMAND LINE

systemd-ssh-generator
understands the following kernel-command-line(7)
parameters:

systemd.ssh_auto=

This
option takes an optional boolean argument, and defaults to
yes. If enabled, the automatic binding to the
AF_VSOCK and AF_UNIX sockets listed above is
done. If disable, this is not done, except for those
explicitly requested via systemd.ssh_listen= on the
kernel command line or via the ssh.listen system
credential.

Added
in version 256.

systemd.ssh_listen=

This
option configures an additional socket to bind SSH to. It
may be used multiple times to bind multiple sockets. The
syntax should follow the one of ListenStream=, see
systemd.socket(5) for details. This functionality
supports all socket families systemd supports, including
AF_INET and AF_INET6.

Added
in version 256.

CREDENTIALS

systemd-ssh-generator
supports the system credentials logic. The following
credentials are used when passed in:

ssh.listen

This
credential should be a text file, with each line referencing
one additional socket to bind SSH to. The syntax should
follow the one of ListenStream=, see
systemd.socket(5) for details. This functionality
supports all socket families systemd supports, including
AF_INET and AF_INET6.

Added
in version 256.
