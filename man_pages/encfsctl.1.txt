DESCRIPTION

encfsctl
is an administrative tool for working with EncFS
filesystems. It is capable of changing the user supplied
password, displaying basic information about an encrypted
volume, and other related operations.

COMMANDS

info

Display basic information about
the filesystem. Takes a single argument, rootdir,
which is the root directory of the encrypted filesystem. The
filesystem need not be mounted. Info is also the
default command if only a root directory is provided on the
command line.

passwd

Allows changing the password of
the encrypted filesystem. The user will be prompted for the
existing password and the new password.

showcruft

Recursively search through the
entire volume and display all files which are not decodable
(only checks filename encoding, not block MAC headers). This
might be useful for cleanup in case you&rsquo;ve made use of
features which create files which are not decodable under
the primary key.

decode

Allows you to specify an
encoded name on the command line, and displays decoded
version. This is mostly useful for debugging, as debug
messages always display encrypted filenames (to avoid
leaking sensitive data through the debug channels). So this
command provides a way to decode the filenames.

The
--extpass option can be used to specify the program
which returns the password - just like with encfs.

If no names are
specified on the command line, then a list of filenames will
be read from stdin and decoded.

encode

Allows you to specify a
filename on the command line, and displays its encoded
version. This is useful if e.g. you are taking a backup of
an encrypted directory and would like to exclude some
files.

The
--extpass option can be used to specify the program
which returns the password - just like with encfs.

If no names are
specified on the command line, then a list of filenames will
be read from stdin and encoded.

cat

Decodes and cats the content of an encrypted
file. The filename can be given in a plain or ciphered form.
With --reverse The file content will instead be
encrypted. 

EXAMPLES

Show
information about an encrypted filesystem:

% encfsctl info
~/.crypt 
Version 5 configuration; created by EncFS 1.1 (revision
20040504) 
Filesystem cipher: "ssl/aes" , version 2:1:1 
Filename encoding: "nameio/block" , version 3:0:1

Key Size: 192 bits 
Block Size: 512 bytes 
Each file contains 8 byte header with unique IV data. 
Filesname encoded using IV chaining mode.
