RELEASE NOTES FOR LIBGUESTFS 1.30

These release
notes only cover the differences from the previous
stable/dev branch split (1.28.0). For detailed changelogs,
please see the git repository, or the ChangeLog file
distributed in the tarball.

New
features 
New tools

virt-dib(1)
is a secure and safe alternative to the OpenStack
"diskimage-builder" tool. It is compatible with
diskimage-builder elements. (Pino Toscano)

virt-get-kernel(1)
extracts the kernel and ramdisk from a disk image.
Previously this functionality was part of
virt-builder(1), but the new tool is more featureful.
(Pino Toscano)

New features
in existing tools

virt-v2v(1)
-i ova mode can now read a wider range of OVA files,
and also unpacked files (directories).

virt-v2v now
securely passes options to curl, so passwords, cookies and
so on cannot be seen by users with shell access on the same
machine.

virt-v2v has a
new --password-file option to allow you to securely
pass in a password, and to avoid an interactive prompt.

virt-v2v
disables Windows autoreboot, making debugging conversion
failures on Windows easier.

virt-v2v now
comes with an extensive external test suite. See
virt-v2v-test-harness(1).

virt-v2v allows
virtio drivers to come from any location (Roman Kagan), and
drivers can be read directly from the virtio ISO.

virt-v2v
supports conversion of Windows ≥ 8. Note this is
experimental, and possibly broken. Use with caution.

virt-v2v can
now convert UEFI guests.

virt-p2v(1)
adds a network configuration dialog.

virt-p2v now
has "p2v.pre", "p2v.post" and
"p2v.fail" triggers, allowing arbitrary scripts
for preparing the host for conversion and tidying up
post-conversion.

virt-p2v now
uses the more advanced metacity window manager (instead of
matchbox).

virt-sysprep(1)
will remove "/var/spool/mail/username" for
non-root accounts (Hu Tao).

virt-customize(1),
virt-builder(1) and virt-sysprep have the following
new options: 
--commands-from-file

allow long lists of commands to
be read from a file instead of from the command line (Pino
Toscano)

--copy

copy files inside the guest
(Maros Zatko)

--copy-in

copy host files recursively
into the guest (Pino Toscano)

--move

move files inside the guest
(Maros Zatko)

--ssh-inject

inject SSH keys into a guest
(Pino Toscano)

--sm-attach 
--sm-credentials 
--sm-register 
--sm-remove 
--sm-unregister

register and unregister a guest
from subscription-manager (Pino Toscano)

--touch

touch a file in the guest (Pino
Toscano)

--truncate 
--truncate-recursive

truncate files (Maros
Zatko)

Improvements to
virt-customize firstboot support. In particular, Windows
firstboot should work as well as Linux (Roman Kagan).

virt-df(1)
can now use PolicyKit, SASL and other authentication methods
when getting the list of domains from libvirt.

Improvements to
guestfish bash completion (Pino Toscano).

Bash completion
now completes short options as well as long options (Pino
Toscano).

guestfish(1)
now displays a command synopsis if the number of parameters
given to a command is wrong (Hu Tao).

virt-builder
now supports Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions back to RHEL
3.

virt-builder
supports SUSE guests using zypper (Cédric
Bosdonnat).

Language
bindings

The Java
bindings now include validated Javadoc, and other
improvements (Pino Toscano).

Multiple fixes
and improvements to the PHP bindings (Pino Toscano).

Inspection

Inspection can
now get icons from RHEL 7 and CentOS 7.

/etc/favicon.png
is now allowed to be a symbolic link.

For RPM-based
guests, inspection now returns RPM Epoch fields.

Debian packages
now have separate Epoch and Version fields (Nikos
Skalkotos).

OpenBSD
detection added, FreeBSD and NetBSD added as separate
"distros", and other BSD inspection improvements
and bug fixes (Nikos Skalkotos).

CoreOS
detection added (Nikos Skalkotos).

The package
manager in Fedora ≥ 22 is "dnf".

ReactOS guests
can be inspected (Maros Zatko).

Add support for
UEFI guests.

Inspection now
works when kernel modules are gzip or xz compressed (Pino
Toscano).

Inspection now
recognizes ppc64 and ppc64le guests (Maros Zatko).

Inspection
lists the installed applications on Archlinux guests (Nikos
Skalkotos).

Architectures
and platforms

PPC64 (POWER7)
and PPC64LE (POWER8) architectures are now much better
supported, and should work out of the box.

For aarch64, we
use AAVMF (an open source UEFI implementation based on OVMF)
if available to run the appliance.

For armv7, we
now use the -M virt machine type by default.

There is better
support for compiling on non-Linux platforms (Pino Toscano,
Margaret Lewicka).

Libguestfs
should now work on MIPS 32 bit little endian
("mipsel"). I have not been able to try 64 bit or
big endian.

Security

CVE-2014-8484 
CVE-2014-8485

Libguestfs previously ran the
strings(1) utility on untrusted files. Strings could
parse BFD headers in an unsafe way, leading to possible
arbitrary code execution. Libguestfs now runs strings with a
flag to ensure it does not try to parse BFD headers. This
could have led to exploitation of the libguestfs appliance,
but since libguestfs further constrains the appliance
through virtualization, SELinux and other techniques, it was
unlikely to have caused any privilege escalation on the
host.

XPath injection in virt-v2v

One possible XPath injection
vulnerability was fixed in virt-v2v. This might have allowed
a malicious guest which was being converted by virt-v2v to
construct an arbitrary XPath expression which would have
been evaluated on the host (by the libxml2 library linked to
the virt-v2v binary). It is not clear what the effects of
this might be.

For further
information, see upstream commit
https://github.com/libguestfs/libguestfs/commit/6c6ce85f94c36803fe2db35a98db436bff0c14b0

Denial of service problems when
using "qemu-img info"

When using the American Fuzzy
Lop fuzzer ("afl-fuzz") on the "qemu-img
info" command, Richard W.M. Jones found that certain
files can cause the "qemu-img" program to use lots
of memory and time (for example 6GB of heap and 14 seconds
of CPU time on a fast Intel processor), and in some cases to
crash. Since libguestfs may run "qemu-img info" on
disk images to find out what they contain, this transitively
could cause libguestfs to hang or consume lots of
memory.

Libguestfs was
modified so that it uses resource limits to limit the space
and time used by "qemu-img info", to avoid this
problem. If a malicious user tries to pass one of these disk
images to libguestfs, "qemu-img" will crash and
the crash is reported back to libguestfs callers as an error
message.

API

New APIs 
"guestfs_add_libvirt_dom"

This exposes a previously
private API that allows you to pass a
"virDomainPtr" object directly from libvirt to
libguestfs.

"guestfs_blockdev_setra"

Adjust readahead parameter for
devices. See "blockdev --setra" command.

"guestfs_btrfs_balance"

"guestfs_btrfs_balance_cancel" 
"guestfs_btrfs_balance_pause" 
"guestfs_btrfs_balance_resume" 
"guestfs_btrfs_balance_status"

Balance support for Btrfs
filesystems (Hu Tao).

"guestfs_btrfs_filesystem_defragment"

Filesystem defragmentation
support for Btrfs filesystems (Hu Tao).

"guestfs_btrfs_image"

Create an image of a Btrfs
filesystem (Chen Hanxiao)

"guestfs_btrfs_qgroup_assign"

"guestfs_btrfs_qgroup_create" 
"guestfs_btrfs_qgroup_destroy" 
"guestfs_btrfs_qgroup_limit" 
"guestfs_btrfs_qgroup_remove" 
"guestfs_btrfs_qgroup_show" 
"guestfs_btrfs_quota_enable" 
"guestfs_btrfs_quota_rescan"

Quote support for Btrfs
filesystems (Hu Tao).

"guestfs_btrfs_rescue_chunk_recover"

Scan and recover the chunk tree
in Btrfs filesystems (Hu Tao).

"guestfs_btrfs_rescue_super_recover"

Restore superblocks in Btrfs
filesystems (Hu Tao).

"guestfs_btrfs_replace"

Replace a device in a Btrfs
filesystem (Cao Jin).

"guestfs_btrfs_scrub"

"guestfs_btrfs_scrub_cancel" 
"guestfs_btrfs_scrub_resume" 
"guestfs_btrfs_scrub_status"

Scrub a Btrfs filesystem (Hu
Tao).

"guestfs_btrfs_subvolume_get_default"

Get the default subvolume of a
Btrfs filesystem (Hu Tao).

"guestfs_btrfs_subvolume_show"

List detailed information about
the subvolume of a Btrfs filesystem (Hu Tao).

"guestfs_btrfstune_enable_extended_inode_refs"

"guestfs_btrfstune_enable_skinny_metadata_extent_refs"

"guestfs_btrfstune_seeding"

Various tuning parameters for
Btrfs filesystems (Chen Hanxiao).

"guestfs_c_pointer"

Return the C pointer to the
underlying "guestfs_h *". This allows interworking
of libguestfs bindings with bindings from other libraries.
For further information see
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1075164

"guestfs_copy_in"

"guestfs_copy_out"

Flexible APIs for recursively
copying directories of files between the host and guest
filesystem. Previously these were available only as
guestfish commands, but now any API users can call them
(Pino Toscano).

"guestfs_part_get_gpt_guid"

"guestfs_part_set_gpt_guid"

Get and set the GPT
per-partition GUID.

"guestfs_part_get_mbr_part_type"

Get MBR partition type (Chen
Hanxiao).

"guestfs_set_uuid_random"

Set the UUID of a filesystem to
a randomly generated value; supported filesystems currently
are ext2/3/4, XFS, Btrfs, and swap partitions. (Chen
Hanxiao).

Other API
changes

"guestfs_disk_create"
can now use VMDK files as backing files.

"guestfs_btrfs_subvolume_snapshot"
takes extra optional parameters (all added by Hu Tao): 
"ro"

for creating a read-only Btrfs
snapshot

"qgroupid"

for adding the snapshot to a
qgroup

"guestfs_btrfs_subvolume_create"
can also take the optional "qgroupid" parameter
(Hu Tao).

"guestfs_set_uuid"
can set UUID of swap partitions, Btrfs (Hu Tao, Chen
Hanxiao).

"guestfs_copy_device_to_file"
and "guestfs_copy_file_to_file" have a new
optional "append" parameter, allowing you to
append to the output file instead of truncating it.

"guestfs_mkfs"
has a new optional "label" parameter to set the
initial label of the new filesystem (Pino Toscano).

"guestfs_set_label"
and "guestfs_set_uuid" now set "ENOTSUP"
as errno when there is no implemented support for the
filesystem of the specified mountable (Chen Hanxiao).

Environment
variables now let you write
"LIBGUESTFS_DEBUG=true",
"LIBGUESTFS_DEBUG=0" and so on.

All
"guestfs_sfdisk*" APIs have been deprecated.
Because sfdisk(8) was rewritten, incompatibly,
upstream, we don’t recommend using these APIs in
future code. Use the "guestfs_part*" APIs as
replacements.

APIs such as
"guestfs_download" do not truncate
/dev/stdout or /dev/stderr when writing to
them, meaning that if you redirect stdout or stderr to a
file, the file is no longer truncated.

Build
changes 
The daemon no longer uses its own separate copy of gnulib.
Instead it shares a single copy with the library.

OCaml
.annot files are now created, so IDEs and editors
like emacs and vi can browse OCaml types in the source
code.

Various fixes
to allow different host/appliance architecture builds (Pino
Toscano).

Automake is now
used directly to build all the OCaml programs, instead of ad
hoc Makefile rules. One side effect of this is to enable
warnings in all the C code used by OCaml programs.

"-fno-strict-overflow"
is used throughout the build to avoid dubious GCC
optimizations.

Multiple
cleanups to support GCC 5.

OCaml OUnit2 is
needed to run some OCaml tests.

Creating a
statically linked libguestfs.a should work again.

The
src/api-support subdirectory and its scripts are no
longer used. Instead we store in the
generator/actions.ml when the API was added to
libguestfs.

Internationalization

The translation service has changed from Transifex to
Zanata.

Many more
translations are available now, for both library and tools
messages and documentation.

Internals

In all OCaml tools, there are now common "error",
"warning", "info" functions, and common
way to set and get the --quiet, -x (trace) and
-v (verbose) flags, and colour highlighting used
consistently.

"COMPILE_REGEXP"
macros are used to simplify PCRE constructors and
destructors.

In the
generator, "Pointer" arguments have finally been
implemented.

Internal
identifiers no longer use double and triple underscores (eg.
"guestfs___program_name"). These identifiers are
invalid for C99 and C++ programs, although compilers would
accept them.

The daemon no
longer parses "guestfs_*" options from
/proc/cmdline. Instead it only takes ordinary command
line options. The appliance init script turns
/proc/cmdline into daemon command line options.

The tests can
now run the daemon as a "captive process",
allowing it to be run directly on the host. The main
advantage of this is we can run valgrind directly on the
daemon during testing.
