DESCRIPTION

udevinfo
queries the udev database for device information stored in
the udev database. It can also query the properties of a
device from its sysfs representation to help creating udev
rules that match this device.

OPTIONS

&minus;&minus;query=type

Query the database for
specified type of device data. It needs the
&minus;&minus;path or &minus;&minus;name to
identify the specified device. Valid queries are:
name, symlink, path, env,
all.

&minus;&minus;path=devpath

The devpath of the device to
query.

&minus;&minus;name=node

The name of the device node or
a symlink to query

&minus;&minus;root

The udev root directory:
/dev. If used in conjunction with a name or
symlink query, the query returns the absolute path
including the root directory.

&minus;&minus;attribute&minus;walk

Print all sysfs properties of
the specified device that can be used in udev rules to match
the specified device. It prints all devices along the chain,
up to the root of sysfs that can be used in udev rules.

&minus;&minus;export

Export the content of the udev
database.
