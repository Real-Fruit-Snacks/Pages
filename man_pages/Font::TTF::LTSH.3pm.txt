NAME
       Font::TTF::LTSH - Linear Threshold table

DESCRIPTION
       Holds the linear threshold for each glyph. This is the ppem value at
       which a glyph's metrics become linear. The value is set to 1 if a
       glyph's metrics are always linear.

INSTANCE VARIABLES
       glyphs
           An array of ppem values. One value per glyph

METHODS
   $t->read
       Reads the table

   $t->out($fh)
       Outputs the LTSH to the given fh.

   $t->minsize()
       Returns the minimum size this table can be. If it is smaller than this,
       then the table must be bad and should be deleted or whatever.

BUGS
       None known
