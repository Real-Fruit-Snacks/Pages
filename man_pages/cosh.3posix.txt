COSH(3POSIX)               POSIX Programmer's Manual              COSH(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       cosh, coshf, coshl — hyperbolic cosine functions

SYNOPSIS
       #include <math.h>

       double cosh(double x);
       float coshf(float x);
       long double coshl(long double x);

DESCRIPTION
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with  the
       ISO C  standard.  Any  conflict between the requirements described here
       and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017
       defers to the ISO C standard.

       These  functions  shall compute the hyperbolic cosine of their argument
       x.

       An application wishing to check for error situations should  set  errno
       to  zero  and  call  feclearexcept(FE_ALL_EXCEPT)  before calling these
       functions. On return, if errno is non-zero or fetestexcept(FE_INVALID |
       FE_DIVBYZERO  |  FE_OVERFLOW  | FE_UNDERFLOW) is non-zero, an error has
       occurred.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, these functions shall return the hyperbolic
       cosine of x.

       If  the  correct  value would cause overflow, a range error shall occur
       and cosh(), coshf(), and coshl() shall return the value  of  the  macro
       HUGE_VAL, HUGE_VALF, and HUGE_VALL, respectively.

       If x is NaN, a NaN shall be returned.

       If x is ±0, the value 1.0 shall be returned.

       If x is ±Inf, +Inf shall be returned.

ERRORS
       These functions shall fail if:

       Range Error The result would cause an overflow.

                   If  the  integer expression (math_errhandling & MATH_ERRNO)
                   is non-zero, then errno shall be set to [ERANGE].   If  the
                   integer  expression  (math_errhandling & MATH_ERREXCEPT) is
                   non-zero, then the overflow floating-point exception  shall
                   be raised.

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       On error, the expressions (math_errhandling & MATH_ERRNO) and (math_er‐
       rhandling & MATH_ERREXCEPT) are independent of each other, but at least
       one of them must be non-zero.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
