BOOT0CFG(8)

NAME

boot0cfg &mdash; boot
manager installation/configuration utility

SYNOPSIS

boot0cfg
[&minus;Bv] [&minus;b boot0]
[&minus;d drive]
[&minus;f file]
[&minus;m mask]
[&minus;o options]
[&minus;s slice]
[&minus;t ticks] disk

DESCRIPTION

The FreeBSD &rsquo;boot0&rsquo;
boot manager permits the operator to select from which disk
and slice an i386 machine (PC) is booted.

Note that what
are referred to here as &rsquo;&rsquo;slices&rsquo;&rsquo;
are typically called &rsquo;&rsquo;partitions&rsquo;&rsquo;
in non-BSD documentation relating to the PC. Typically, only
non-removable disks are sliced.

The
boot0cfg utility optionally installs the
&rsquo;boot0&rsquo; boot manager on the specified
disk; and allows various operational parameters to be
configured.

On PCs, a boot
manager typically occupies sector 0 of a disk, which is
known as the Master Boot Record (MBR). The MBR contains both
code (to which control is passed by the PC BIOS) and data
(an embedded table of defined slices).

The options
are:

&minus;B

Install the
&rsquo;boot0&rsquo; boot manager. This option causes MBR
code to be replaced, without affecting the embedded slice
table.

&minus;b boot0

Specify which
&rsquo;boot0&rsquo; image to use. The default is
/boot/boot0 which will use the video card as output,
alternatively /boot/boot0sio can be used for output
to the COM1 port. (Be aware that nothing will be output to
the COM1 port unless the modem signals DSR and CTS are
active.)

&minus;d drive

Specify the drive number used
by the PC BIOS in referencing the drive which contains the
specified disk. Typically this will be 0x80 for the
first hard drive, 0x81 for the second hard drive, and so on;
however any integer between 0 and 0xff is acceptable
here.

&minus;f file

Specify that a backup copy of
the preexisting MBR should be written to file. This
file is created if it does not exist, and replaced if it
does.

&minus;m mask

Specify slices to be
enabled/disabled, where mask is an integer between 0
(no slices enabled) and 0xf (all four slices enabled).

&minus;o
options

A comma-separated string of any
of the following options may be specified (with
&rsquo;&rsquo;no&rsquo;&rsquo; prepended as necessary):

packet

Use the disk
packet (BIOS INT 0x13 extensions) interface, as opposed to
the legacy (CHS) interface, when doing disk I/O. This allows
booting above cylinder 1023, but requires specific BIOS
support. The default is &rsquo;nopacket&rsquo;.

setdrv

Forces the
drive containing the disk to be referenced using drive
number definable by means of the -d option. The default is
&rsquo;nosetdrv&rsquo;.

update

Allow the MBR
to be updated by the boot manager. (The MBR may be updated
to flag slices as &rsquo;active&rsquo;, and to save slice
selection information.) This is the default; a
&rsquo;noupdate&rsquo; option causes the MBR to be treated
as read-only.

&minus;s slice

Set the default boot selection
to slice. Values between 1 and 4 refer to slices; a
value of 5 refers to the option of booting from a second
disk.

&minus;t ticks

Set the timeout value to
ticks. (There are approximately 18.2 ticks per
second.)

&minus;v

Verbose:
display information about the slices defined, etc.

FILES 
/boot/boot0

The default
&rsquo;boot0&rsquo; image

/boot/boot0sio

Image for
serial consoles (COM1,9600,8,N,1,MODEM)

EXAMPLES

To boot slice 2 on the next
boot:

boot0cfg -s 2
ad0

To enable just
slices 1 and 2 in the menu:

boot0cfg -m 0x3
ad0

DIAGNOSTICS

The boot0cfg utility
exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error
occurs.

BUGS

Use of the &rsquo;packet&rsquo;
option may cause &rsquo;boot0&rsquo; to fail, depending on
the nature of BIOS support.

Use of the
&rsquo;setdrv&rsquo; option with an incorrect -d operand may
cause the MBR to be written to the wrong disk. Be
careful!
