SYNOPSIS

kitpost
[ -hrV ] [ -H file ] [ -D
desc ] [ -m dest1,dest2 ] [ kits
] [ newsgroups ]

DESCRIPTION

Kitpost
posts distribution kits made by makedist to some
(source) newsgroups specified on the command line. If you do
not specify any kit list, then all the kits are sent.
Otherwise, only the specified kits will be (re)sent.

A kit list may
include ranges, 1-10 specifying kits 1 through 10,
and 5- meaning kits 5 up to the last one. You may
also specify kit numbers by separating them with commas or
spaces, and even mix with ranges, such as: 1 3 5-7
9.

Kitpost
ensures correct References: lines are inserted in
your postings so that all parts but the first point to the
root article. Threaded newsreaders and end-users
traditionally appreciate that.

OPTIONS

The following
options are recognized by kitpost:

-h

Print help message and exit.

-m
dest1,destn

Sends kits by e-mail to the
specified recipients. This option may be used in conjunction
with newsgroup posting. It is mainly intended for sites
where direct posting to a moderated newsgroup is not allowed
by inews. You may thus send your kits to the
newsgroup moderator in a form that will ease the whole
posting process.

-r

Signals a repost.

-D
description

Specify a description string
that will be added to the subject line. Usually a brief
sentence (less than, say, 40 characters).

-H file

Specify a file to be used as header introduction in the
first part of your posting. Usually the root README
file. 

-V

Print version number and exit.

BUGS

Article
cross-referencing is properly set-up only when the whole
package is (re)posted in one batch.

It is not
currently possible to set-up the article headers manually or
better, interactively.
