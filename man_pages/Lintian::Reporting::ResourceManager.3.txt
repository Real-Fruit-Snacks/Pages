DESCRIPTION
       A simple resource manager for Lintian's reporting tool, html_reports.

CLASS METHODS
       new(TYPE, OPTS)
           Instantiates a new resource manager.

           OPTS is a key-value list, which must contain the key "html_dir" set
           to the root of the HTML path.  It is beneath this path that all
           resources will be installed

INSTANCE METHODS
       install_resource(RESOURCE[, OPT])
           Installs RESOURCE into the html root.  The resource may be renamed
           (based on content etc.).

           Note that the basename of RESOURCE must be unique between all
           resources installed.  See "resource_url(RESOURCE_NAME)".

           If OPT is given, it must be a hashref with 0 or more of the
           following keys (and values).

           install_method
               Can be "copy" or "move" (default).  If set to "move", the
               original file will be renamed into its new location.
               Otherwise, a copy is done and the original file is left in
               place.

           source_file
               By default, the path denoted by RESOURCE is both the resource
               name and the source file.  This option can be used to install a
               given file as RESOURCE regardless of the basename of the source
               file.

               If this is passed, RESOURCE must be a basename (i.e. without
               any slashes).

       resource_url(RESOURCE_NAME)
           Returns the path (relative to the HTML root) to a resource
           installed via "install_resource(RESOURCE)", where RESOURCE_NAME is
           the basename of the path given to install_resource.

       resource_integrity_value(RESOURCE_NAME)
           Return a string that is valid in the "integrity" field of a
           "<link>" HTML tag.  (See https://www.w3.org/TR/SRI/)
