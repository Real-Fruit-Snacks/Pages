NAME

ng_rfc1490 &mdash; RFC
1490 netgraph node type

SYNOPSIS

#include

DESCRIPTION

The rfc1490 node type
performs protocol encapsulation, de-encapsulation, and
multiplexing according to RFC 1490 (which has since been
updated by RFC 2427). This particular type of encapsulation
is often used on top of frame relay DLCI channels.

The downstream
hook is used to transmit and receive encapsulated frames. On
the other side of the node, the inet and ppp hooks are used
to transmit and receive raw IP frames and PPP frames,
respectively. PPP frames are transmitted and received
according to RFC 1973; in particular, frames appearing on
the ppp hook begin with the PPP protocol number. The
ethernet hook can be used to transmit and receive Ethernet
frames (without a checksum) in RFC 1490&rsquo;s bridging
format.

Typically the
inet hook is connected to the inet hook of an ng_iface(4)
node.

HOOKS

This node type supports the
following hooks:

downstream

Connects to the
RFC 1490 peer entity.

ethernet

Transmits and
receives bridged raw Ethernet frames, without a
checksum.

inet

Transmits and
receives raw IP frames.

ppp

Transmits and
receives PPP frames.

CONTROL MESSAGES

This node type supports the
generic control messages, plus the following:

NGM_RFC1490_SET_ENCAP
(setencap)

This command sets encapsulation
method for the node. The desired method must be passed as a
string message argument, and must be one of the following
supported encapsulation modes:

"ietf-ip"

IP packets are
sent using simple RFC1490/2427 encapsulation.

"ietf-snap"

IP packets are
sent inside SNAP frames. Also conforms to RFC1490/2427.

"cisco"

IP packets are
sent and received using proprietary Cisco encapsulation
method.

NGM_RFC1490_GET_ENCAP
(getencap)

This command returns current
encapsulation method on the node.

SHUTDOWN

This node shuts down upon
receipt of a NGM_SHUTDOWN control message, or when all hooks
have been disconnected.
