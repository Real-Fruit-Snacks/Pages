DESCRIPTION

This program is
used to manipulate the routing tables of the NET/ROM network
layer, or to get and set many of the network and transport
layer parameters for the NET/ROM protocol. The program has
three basic modes of operation, node setting, neighbour
setting and general parameter setting. The syntax for the
node and neighbour setting is taken from the original
NET/ROM manual and is therefore not very UNIXy but should be
familiar to those familiar with NET/ROMs or TheNet.

To set up a new
route to a NET/ROM node in the routing tables you must use
the nodes option. All of the parameters are needed to add
the node. It is probably best to illustrate with an
example:

nrparms -nodes GB7BPQ + NMCLUS 120 6 vhf
G8ROU-3 

This creates a
new route to a distant node with the callsign GB7BPQ and the
alias NMCLUS, it has a quality of 120 (out of 255) and has
an obsolescence count of six and packets for that node
should be sent on the AX.25 port named vhf to my immediate
neighbour G8ROU-3. The callsigns of the node and the
neighbour may be the same. For example to set up the node
G8ROU-3 which is also my immediate neighbour, I would
use:

nrparms -nodes G8ROU-3 + MATLCK 200 6 vhf
G8ROU-3 

If the ident of
the remote node is not known, it is possible to add a node
with a blank ident. To do this an ident of &rsquo;*&rsquo;
must be entered on the command line. Because of the command
line expansion that shells do, the * must be escaped by
enclosing it in quotes.

It is also
possible to remove a route to a distant node with the same
command except that the + is replaced by a -. The other
parameters must also be present. If the node has not other
routes then the node will be deleted, and the neighbour node
that the connections go via may also be deleted if no other
node route uses it, and it is not a locked neighbour
entry.

When setting up
a new node, a new neighbour entry may also be created. This
will have a default value. For that neighbour to be
meaningful in the automatic routing process, it must have a
more reasonable entry in the neighbours list. To do this the
routes option of the command must be used. An example:

nrparms -routes ax0 G8ROU-3 + 120

This will
create (or update) the neighbour entry for G8ROU-3 with a
quality of 120 and it will be locked, it will not create a
node entry for the neighbour. This quality will be used by
the netromd(8) program when calculating route
qualities via this neighbour. Normally once a neighbour has
zero node routes going via it, it will be deleted. Locking a
neighbour prevents the deletion from occurring. To unlock a
neighbour entry, the same command is used but with the +
replaced by a -.
