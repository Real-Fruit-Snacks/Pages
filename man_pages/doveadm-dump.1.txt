NAME

doveadm-dump -
Dump the content of Dovecot's binary mailbox index/log

SYNOPSIS

doveadm
[-Dv] dump [-t type]
path

DESCRIPTION

Dovecot uses
several binary index and log files in order to improve
performance for accessing mails. For some mailbox formats,
such as sdbox and mdbox, the index files are part of the
format itself. For details about index files, see also:
http://wiki2.dovecot.org/IndexFiles

doveadm
dump is used to show the contents of those mailbox
index/log files, in human readable format. This is mainly
useful for Dovecot developers when debugging some
problem.
