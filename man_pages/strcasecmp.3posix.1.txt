PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       strcasecmp, strcasecmp_l, strncasecmp, strncasecmp_l — case-insensitive
       string comparisons

SYNOPSIS
       #include <strings.h>

       int strcasecmp(const char *s1, const char *s2);
       int strcasecmp_l(const char *s1, const char *s2,
           locale_t locale);
       int strncasecmp(const char *s1, const char *s2, size_t n);
       int strncasecmp_l(const char *s1, const char *s2,
           size_t n, locale_t locale);

DESCRIPTION
       The  strcasecmp() and strcasecmp_l() functions shall compare, while ig‐
       noring differences in case, the string pointed to by s1 to  the  string
       pointed  to  by  s2.   The  strncasecmp() and strncasecmp_l() functions
       shall compare, while ignoring differences in  case,  not  more  than  n
       bytes from the string pointed to by s1 to the string pointed to by s2.

       The  strcasecmp() and strncasecmp() functions use the current locale to
       determine the case of the characters.

       The strcasecmp_l() and strncasecmp_l() functions use the locale  repre‐
       sented by locale to determine the case of the characters.

       When  the  LC_CTYPE category of the locale being used is from the POSIX
       locale, these functions shall behave as if the strings  had  been  con‐
       verted  to  lowercase  and then a byte comparison performed. Otherwise,
       the results are unspecified.

       The behavior is undefined if the locale argument to  strcasecmp_l()  or
       strncasecmp_l() is the special locale object LC_GLOBAL_LOCALE or is not
       a valid locale object handle.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon completion, strcasecmp() and strcasecmp_l() shall return an  inte‐
       ger greater than, equal to, or less than 0, if the string pointed to by
       s1 is, ignoring case, greater than, equal to, or less than  the  string
       pointed to by s2, respectively.

       Upon successful completion, strncasecmp() and strncasecmp_l() shall re‐
       turn an integer greater than, equal to, or less than 0, if the possibly
       null-terminated array pointed to by s1 is, ignoring case, greater than,
       equal to, or less than the possibly null-terminated array pointed to by
       s2, respectively.
