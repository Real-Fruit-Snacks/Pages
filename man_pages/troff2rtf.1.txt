NAME

troff2rtf -
convert troff documents to Rich Text Format

SYNTAX

troff2rtf
[ -mxx ] [ -S charset ] [
file ... ]

DESCRIPTION

troff2rtf
processes documents written to be formatted with
troff (or nroff, or any of the other
*roff variants) and converts them to Rich Text
Format. RTF is a reasonably portable interchange standard;
files in RTF format can be read by a variety of
applications, e.g., Microsoft Word, WordPerfect (Macintosh
version 2.0 and up), WriteNow.

The main use
for troff2rtf is to make it easier to transport
troff documents for use with microcomputers. First,
convert your document to RTF:

% troff2rtf
[options] file > file.rtf

The available options are
described below. The one you&rsquo;ll most likely use is
-mxx to specify a macro package like
-me or -ms. If the document contains tables,
the conversion can be done like this instead:

% tblcvt file |
troff2rtf [options] > file.rtf

Then move the RTF file to your
target machine and read it into your document processor.

Optional flags
may be given to modify the operation of troff2rtf, as
follows:

-mxx

Specify macro package, usually -man, -me,
-mm, or -ms.

-S charset

Specify the RTF character set.
charset can be one of the following: ansi mac pc
pca. The default is the Macintosh character set. For
documents that you intend to use under Windows, -S
ansi is a better choice.

BUGS

Table output
generated when troff2rtf is used in concert with
tblcvt has been known to crash Word outright; caution
may be in order. In addition, you may need to read the
resulting RTF document into a word processor and tweak
column widths manually.

Word97 adds
support for vertically merging table cells (using the
\clvmgf and \clvmrg control words).
troff2rtf supports vertical spans using these
controls, but earlier versions of Word don&rsquo;t yet
understand them. Consequently, what you&rsquo;ll see for
n-cell vertical spans is n individual cells,
with all the text in the top cell and n-1 empty cells
below it.
