ACPI_VIDEO(4)

NAME

acpi_video &mdash; ACPI
Video Extensions driver

SYNOPSIS

device acpi_video

DESCRIPTION

This driver uses the ACPI Video
Extensions to control display switching and backlight
brightness. The availability of the sysctl(8) variables
depends on the functions offered by the host&rsquo;s ACPI
implementation.

SYSCTL VARIABLES

The following sysctls are
currently implemented, where &lang; device&rang; is
crt, lcd, or tv:

hw.acpi.video.&lang;

device&rang; .active

Current state of the output
device.

hw.acpi.video.&lang;

device&rang; .levels

List of supported brightness
levels.

hw.acpi.video.&lang;

device&rang; .brightness

Current brightness level of the
device.

hw.acpi.video.&lang;

device&rang; .fullpower

Preset brightness level to be
used in full power mode.

hw.acpi.video.&lang;

device&rang; .economy

Preset brightness level to be
used in economy mode.

Defaults for
these variables can be set in sysctl.conf(5), which is
parsed at boot-time.

BUGS

Some systems only perform output
switching via SMM even though they export the proper
information via ACPI. On such systems, the proper hotkeys or
OEM driver (for example, acpi_toshiba(4)) must be used
instead.
