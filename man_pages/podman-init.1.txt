NAME

podman-init -
Initialize one or more containers

SYNOPSIS

podman
init [options] container
[container...]

podman
container init [options] container
[container...]

DESCRIPTION

Initialize one
or more containers. You may use container IDs or names as
input. Initializing a container performs all tasks necessary
for starting the container (mounting filesystems, creating
an OCI spec, initializing the container network) but does
not start the container. If a container is not initialized,
the podman start and podman run commands
initialize it automatically prior to starting it. This
command is intended to be used for inspecting a
container’s filesystem or OCI spec prior to starting
it. This can be used to inspect the container before it
runs, or debug why a container is failing to run.

OPTIONS

--all,
-a 
Initialize all containers. Containers that have already
initialized (including containers that have been started and
are running) are ignored.

--latest,
-l 
Instead of providing the container name or ID, use the last
created container. Note: the last started container can be
from other users of Podman on the host machine. (This option
is not available with the remote Podman client, including
Mac and Windows (excluding WSL2) machines)

EXAMPLE

Initialize
container with a given ID

podman init
35480fc9d568

Initialize
container with a given name

podman init
test1

Initialize the
latest container created by Podman

podman init
--latest
