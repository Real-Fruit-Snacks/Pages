NAME

guestfs-gobject
- How to use libguestfs with the GObject bindings

SYNOPSIS

From Javascript
using gjs:

const Guestfs =
imports.gi.Guestfs; 
var g = new Guestfs.Session(); 
g.add_drive('disk.img', null); 
g.launch(); 
g.close();

DESCRIPTION

This manual
page documents how to call libguestfs using GObject
bindings, especially from Javascript.

Note that the
GObject bindings have problems handling 64 bit values. You
should not use the GObject bindings if there are native
bindings for your language. For example, to use libguestfs
from Python you are strongly advised to use the Python
native bindings instead (see guestfs-python(3)).

This page just
documents the differences from the C API and gives some
examples. If you are not familiar with using libguestfs, you
also need to read guestfs(3).

JAVASCRIPT

Using gjs, you
can write a ".js" file containing:

const Guestfs =
imports.gi.Guestfs; 
var g = new Guestfs.Session(); 
g.add_drive('disk.img', null); 
g.launch(); 
g.close();

and then run it
using:

gjs
program.js
