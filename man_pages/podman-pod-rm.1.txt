NAME

podman-pod-rm -
Remove one or more stopped pods and containers

SYNOPSIS

podman pod
rm [options] pod

DESCRIPTION

podman
pod rm removes one or more stopped pods and their
containers from the host. The pod name or ID can be used.
The -f option stops all containers and then removes them
before removing the pod. If all containers added by the user
are in an exited state, the pod is removed.

OPTIONS

--all,
-a 
Remove all pods. Can be used in conjunction with -f as
well.

--force,
-f 
Stop running containers and delete all stopped containers
before removal of pod.

--ignore,
-i 
Ignore errors when specified pods are not in the container
store. A user might have decided to manually remove a pod
which leads to a failure during the ExecStop directive of a
systemd service referencing that pod.

--latest,
-l 
Instead of providing the pod name or ID, use the last
created pod. Note: the last started pod can be from other
users of Podman on the host machine. (This option is not
available with the remote Podman client, including Mac and
Windows (excluding WSL2) machines)

--pod-id-file=file

Read pod ID from the specified file and rm the pod.
Can be specified multiple times.

If specified,
the pod-id-file is removed along with the pod.

--time,
-t=seconds 
Seconds to wait before forcibly stopping running containers
within the pod. Use -1 for infinite wait.

The --force
option must be specified to use the --time option.
