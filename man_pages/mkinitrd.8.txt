NAME

mkinitrd - is a
compat wrapper, which calls dracut to generate an
initramfs

SYNOPSIS

mkinitrd
[OPTION...] []

DESCRIPTION

mkinitrd
creates an initramfs image  for the
kernel with version  by calling
"dracut".

Important

If a more fine grained control over the resulting image is
needed, "dracut" should be called directly.

OPTIONS

--version

print info about the
version

-v,
--verbose

increase verbosity
level

-f,
--force

overwrite existing
initramfs file.

*--image-version

append the kernel version
to the target image
-.

--with=

add the kernel module
 to the initramfs.

--preload=

preload the kernel module
 in the initramfs before any other kernel
modules are loaded. This can be used to ensure a certain
device naming, which should in theory be avoided and the use
of symbolic links in /dev is encouraged.

--nocompress

do not compress the
resulting image.

--help

print a help message and
exit.

AVAILABILITY

The
mkinitrd command is part of the dracut package and is
available from
https://dracut.wiki.kernel.org
