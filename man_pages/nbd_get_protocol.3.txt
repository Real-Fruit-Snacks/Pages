NAME

nbd_get_protocol
- return the NBD protocol variant

SYNOPSIS

#include

const char * nbd_get_protocol ( 
struct nbd_handle *h 
);

DESCRIPTION

Return the NBD
protocol variant in use on the connection. At the moment
this returns one of the strings "oldstyle",
"newstyle" or "newstyle-fixed". Other
strings might be returned in the future. Most modern NBD
servers use "newstyle-fixed".

This call does
not block, because it returns data that is saved in the
handle from the NBD protocol handshake.

RETURN VALUE

This call
returns a statically allocated string, valid for the
lifetime of the process or until libnbd is unloaded by
dlclose(3). You must not try to free the
string.

ERRORS

On error
"NULL" is returned.

Refer to
"ERROR HANDLING" in libnbd(3) for how to
get further details of the error.

The following
parameters must not be NULL: "h". For more
information see "Non-NULL parameters" in
libnbd(3).
