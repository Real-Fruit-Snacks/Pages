NAME
       Dpkg::Deps::AND - list of AND dependencies

DESCRIPTION
       This class represents a list of dependencies that must be met at the
       same time. It inherits from Dpkg::Deps::Multiple.

METHODS
       $dep->output([$fh])
           The output method uses ", " to join the list of sub-dependencies.

       $dep->implies($other_dep)
           Returns 1 when $dep implies $other_dep. Returns 0 when $dep implies
           NOT($other_dep). Returns undef when there's no implication. $dep
           and $other_dep do not need to be of the same type.

       $dep->get_evaluation($facts)
           Evaluates the dependency given a list of installed packages and a
           list of virtual packages provided. These lists are part of the
           Dpkg::Deps::KnownFacts object given as parameters.

           Returns 1 when it's true, 0 when it's false, undef when some
           information is lacking to conclude.

       $dep->simplify_deps($facts, @assumed_deps)
           Simplifies the dependency as much as possible given the list of
           facts (see object Dpkg::Deps::KnownFacts) and a list of other
           dependencies that are known to be true.
