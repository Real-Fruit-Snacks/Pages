DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page  describes  the  files that are in use by the Debian
       exim4 packages and which are not part of an exim installation done from
       source.

/etc/aliases
       is a table providing a mechanism to redirect mail for local recipients.
       /etc/aliases is a text file which is roughly compatible with  Sendmail.
       The file should contain lines of the form
       name: address, address, ...
       The  name is a local address without domain part. All local domains are
       handled equally. For  more  detailed  documentation,  please  refer  to
       /usr/share/doc/exim4-base/spec.txt.gz,     chapter     22,    and    to
       /usr/share/doc/exim4-base/README.Debian.gz. Please note that it is  not
       possible  to use delivery to arbitrary files, directories and to pipes.
       This is forbidden in Debian's exim4 default configuration.

       You should at least set up an alias for postmaster in the  /etc/aliases
       file.

/etc/email-addresses
       is  used  to rewrite the email addresses of users. This is particularly
       useful for users who use their ISP's domain for email.

       The file should contain lines of the form

       user: someone@isp.com
       otheruser: someoneelse@anotherisp.com

       This way emails from user will appear to be from someone@isp.com to the
       outside  world.  Technically, the from, reply-to, and sender addresses,
       along with the envelope sender, are rewritten for users that appear  to
       be in the local domain.

/etc/exim4/local_host_blacklist
       [exim host list] is an optional file containing a list of IP addresses,
       networks and host names whose messages will be denied  with  the  error
       message "locally blacklisted". This is a full exim 4 host list, and all
       available features can be used. This includes negative items, and so it
       is  possible  to  exclude  addresses from being blacklisted. For conve‐
       nience, as an additional  method  to  whitelist  addresses  from  being
       blocked,  an  explicit  whitelist  is  read in from /etc/exim4/host_lo‐
       cal_deny_exceptions. Entries in the  whitelist  override  corresponding
       blacklist entries.

       In  the blacklist, the trick is to read a line break as "or" if it fol‐
       lows a positive item, and as "and" if it follows a negative item.

       For example, a /etc/exim4/local_host_blacklist

       192.168.10.0/24
       !172.16.10.128/26
       172.16.10.0/24
       10.0.0.0/8

       Exim just evaluates left to right (or up-down in the file listing  con‐
       text),  so you don't get the same kind of operator binding as in a pro‐
       gramming language.

/etc/exim4/host_local_deny_exceptions
       [exim host list] contains a list of IP  addresses,  networks  and  host
       names  whose  messages  will  be  accepted  despite the address is also
       listed in /etc/exim4/local_host_blacklist, overriding a blacklisting.

/etc/exim4/local_sender_blacklist
       [exim address list] is an optional files containing a list of  envelope
       senders  whose  messages will be denied with the error message "locally
       blacklisted".  This is a full exim 4 address list,  and  all  available
       features can be used. This includes negative items, and so it is possi‐
       ble to exclude addresses from being blacklisted. For convenience, as an
       additional  method  to  whitelist  addresses from being blocked, an ex‐
       plicit whitelist is read  in  from  /etc/exim4/sender_local_deny_excep‐
       tions.  Entries  in  the whitelist override corresponding blacklist en‐
       tries.

       In the blacklist, the trick is to read a line break as "or" if it  fol‐
       lows a positive item, and as "and" if it follows a negative item.

       For example, a /etc/exim4/local_sender_blacklist

       domain1.example
       !local@domain2.example
       domain2.example
       domain3.example

       Exim  just evaluates left to right (or up-down in the file listing con‐
       text), so you don't get the same kind of operator binding as in a  pro‐
       gramming language.

/etc/exim4/sender_local_deny_exceptions
       [exim  address  list] is an optional file containing a list of envelope
       senders whose messages will be accepted despite the address being  also
       listed in /etc/exim4/local_sender_blacklist, overriding a blacklisting.

/etc/exim4/local_sender_callout
       [exim  address  list] is an optional file containing a list of envelope
       senders whose messages are subject to sender verification with a  call‐
       out.  This is a full exim4 address list, and all available features can
       be used.

/etc/exim4/local_rcpt_callout
       [exim address list] is an optional file containing a list  of  envelope
       recipients for which incoming messages are subject to recipient verifi‐
       cation with a callout. This is a  full  exim4  address  list,  and  all
       available features can be used.

/etc/exim4/local_domain_dnsbl_whitelist
       [exim  address  list] is an optional file containing a list of envelope
       senders whose messages are exempt from blacklisting via a  domain-based
       DNSBL.  This  is  a full exim4 address list, and all available features
       can be used.  This feature is intended to be used in case of a  domain-
       based  DNSBL  being  too  heavy handed, for example listing entire top-
       level domains for their registry policies.

/etc/exim4/hubbed_hosts
       [exim domain list] is an optional file containing a list of  route_data
       records  which  can  be used to override or augment MX information from
       the DNS. This is particularly useful for mail hubs which  are  highest-
       priority  MX  for  a domain in the DNS but are not final destination of
       the messages, passing them on to a host which is  not  publicly  reach‐
       able, or to temporarily fix mail routing in case of broken DNS setups.

       The  file  should  contain  key-value pairs of domain pattern and route
       data of the form

       domain: host-list options
       dict.ref.example:  mail-1.ref.example:mail-2.ref.example
       foo.example: internal.mail.example.com
       bar.example: 192.168.183.3

       which will cause mail for foo.example to be sent  to  the  host  inter‐
       nal.mail.example  (IP  address derived from A record only), and mail to
       bar.example to be sent to 192.168.183.3.

       See spec.txt chapter 20.3 through 20.7 for a more detailed  explanation
       of host list format and available options.

/etc/exim4/passwd
       contains account and password data for SMTP authentication when the lo‐
       cal exim is SMTP server and clients authenticate to the local exim.

       The file should contain lines of the form

       username:crypted-password:clear-password

       crypted-password is the crypt(3)-created hash  of  your  password.  You
       can,  for  example,  use the mkpasswd program from the whois package to
       create a crypted password. It is recommended to use a modern hash algo‐
       rithm, see mkpasswd --method=help. Consider not using crypt or MD5.

       clear-password  is only necessary if you want to offer CRAM-MD5 authen‐
       tication. If you don't plan on doing so, the third column can be  omit‐
       ted completely.

       This  file  must be readable for the Debian-exim user and should not be
       readable for others. Recommended file mode is root:Debian-exim 640.

/etc/exim4/passwd.client
       contains account and password data for SMTP authentication when exim is
       authenticating as a client to some remote server.

       The file should contain lines of the form

       target.mail.server.example:login-user-name:password

       which  will cause exim to use login-user-name and password when sending
       messages  to   a   server   with   the   canonical   host   name   tar‐
       get.mail.server.example.   Please note that this does not configure the
       mail server to send to (this is determined in Debconf), but  only  cre‐
       ates  the  correlation between host name and authentication credentials
       to avoid exposing passwords to the wrong host.

       Please note that target.mail.server.example is currently the value that
       exim  can  read from reverse DNS: It first follows the host name of the
       target system until it finds an IP address, and then looks up  the  re‐
       verse  DNS for that IP address to use the outcome of this query (or the
       IP  address   itself   should   the   query   fail)   as   index   into
       /etc/exim4/passwd.client.

       This  goes  inevitably  wrong  if the host name of the mail server is a
       CNAME (a DNS alias), or the reverse lookup does  not  fit  the  forward
       one.

       Currently, you need to manually lookup all reverse DNS names for all IP
       addresses that your SMTP server host name points to, for example by us‐
       ing  the host command.  If the SMTP smarthost alias expands to multiple
       IPs, you need to have multiple lines for all the hosts.  When your  ISP
       changes the alias, you will need to manually fix that.

       You may minimize this trouble by using a wild card entry or regular ex‐
       pressions, thus reducing the risk of  divulging  the  password  to  the
       wrong  SMTP server while reducing the number of necessary lines.  For a
       deeper discussion, see the Debian BTS #244724.

       password is your SMTP password in clear text. If you do not know  about
       your  SMTP  password,  you  can try using your POP3 password as a first
       guess.

       This file must be readable for the Debian-exim user and should  not  be
       readable for others. Recommended file mode is root:Debian-exim 640.

       # example for CONFDIR/passwd.client
       # this will only match if the server's generic name matches exactly
       mail.server.example:user:password
       # this will deliver the password to any server
       *:username:password
       # this will deliver the password to servers whose generic name ends in
       # mail.server.example
       *.mail.server.example:user:password
       # this will deliver the password to servers whose generic name matches
       # the regular expression
       ^smtp[0-9]*\.mail\.server\.example:user:password

/etc/exim4/exim.crt
       contains  the  certificate  that exim uses to initiate TLS connections.
       This   is   public   information   and   can   be    world    readable.
       /usr/share/doc/exim4-base/examples/exim-gencert can be used to generate
       a private key and self-signed certificate.

/etc/exim4/exim.key
       contains the private key belonging  to  the  certificate  in  exim.crt.
       This  file's contents must be kept secret and should have mode root:De‐
       bian-exim 640.  /usr/share/doc/exim4-base/examples/exim-gencert can  be
       used to generate a private key and self-signed certificate.

/etc/mailname
       The  "mail  name"  of  the system. See Debian policy Chapter Customized
       programs and exim4-base's README.Debian for further details.

BUGS
       Plenty. Please report them through the Debian BTS

       This manual page needs a major re-work. If somebody knows better  groff
       than  us  and  has more experience in writing manual pages, any patches
       would be greatly appreciated.

NOTES
   Unresolvable items in host lists
       Adding or keeping items in the abovementioned host lists which are  not
       resolvable by DNS has severe consequences.

       e.g.,  if resolving a hostname in local_host_blacklist returns a tempo‐
       rary error (DNS timeout) exim will not be able to check whether a  con‐
       necting  host is part of the list.  Exim will therefore return a tempo‐
       rary SMTP error for every connecting host.

       On the other hand if there is a permanent error in resolving a name  in
       the  host list (the record was removed from DNS) exim behaves as if the
       host does not match the list. e.g., a  local_host_blacklist  consisting
       of

       notresolvable.example.com:rejectme.example.com

       is  equivalent to an empty one. – Exim tries to match the IP-address of
       the connecting host to notresolvable.example.com, resolving this IP  by
       DNS  fails,  exim  behaves as if the connecting host does not match the
       list. List processing stops at this point!

       Starting the list with the special pattern +ignore_unknown as  a  safe‐
       guard  against  this  behavior is strongly recommended if hostnames are
       used in hostlists.

       See Exim specification Chapter Domain, host, address,  and  local  part
       lists  ,  section Behaviour when an IP address or name cannot be found.
