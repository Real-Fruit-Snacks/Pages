CREAT(3POSIX)              POSIX Programmer's Manual             CREAT(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       creat — create a new file or rewrite an existing one

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/stat.h>
       #include <fcntl.h>

       int creat(const char *path, mode_t mode);

DESCRIPTION
       The creat() function shall behave as if it is implemented as follows:

           int creat(const char *path, mode_t mode)
           {
               return open(path, O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, mode);
           }

RETURN VALUE
       Refer to open().

ERRORS
       Refer to open().

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
   Creating a File
       The following example creates the file /tmp/file with  read  and  write
       permissions  for  the file owner and read permission for group and oth‐
       ers. The resulting file descriptor is assigned to the fd variable.

           #include <fcntl.h>
           ...
           int fd;
           mode_t mode = S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IRGRP | S_IROTH;
           char *pathname = "/tmp/file";
           ...
           fd = creat(pathname, mode);
           ...

APPLICATION USAGE
       None.

RATIONALE
       The creat() function is redundant. Its services are  also  provided  by
       the open() function. It has been included primarily for historical pur‐
       poses since many existing applications depend on it. It is best consid‐
       ered a part of the C binding rather than a function that should be pro‐
       vided in other languages.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
