NAME

pinentry-tty -
PIN or pass-phrase entry dialog for GnuPG

SYNOPSIS

pinentry-tty
[OPTION...]

DESCRIPTION

pinentry-tty
is a program that allows for secure entry of PINs or pass
phrases. That means it tries to take care that the entered
information is not swapped to disk or temporarily stored
anywhere. This functionality is particularly useful for
entering pass phrases when using encryption software such as
GnuPG or e-mail clients using the same. It uses an open
protocol and is therefore not tied to particular
software.

pinentry-tty
implements a PIN entry prompt directly on the controlling
tty. It has minimal dependencies, and a comparably minimal
feature set. It is useful for users working with dumb
terminals and other similarly constrained environments.
There are other pinentry flavors that implement more
user-friendly PIN entry dialogs, either in text mode with
the curses toolkit, or using graphical X11 toolkits. Please
use one of the other flavors unless you know what you are
doing.

pinentry-tty
is typically used internally by gpg-agent. Users
don&rsquo;t normally have a reason to call it directly.

OPTIONS

--version

Print the program version and
licensing information.

--help

Print a usage message summarizing the most useful
command-line options.

--debug, -d

Turn on some debugging. Mostly
useful for the maintainers. Note that this may reveal
sensitive information like the entered pass phrase.

--enhanced,
-e

Ask for timeouts and insurance,
too. Note that this is currently not fully supported.

--no-global-grab,
-g

Grab the keyboard only when the
window is focused. Use this option if you are debugging
software using pinentry-tty; otherwise you may not be
able to to access your X session anymore (unless you have
other means to connect to the machine to kill
pinentry-tty).

--parent-wid
N

Use window ID N as the
parent window for positioning the window. Note, that this is
not fully supported by all flavors of pinentry.

--display STRING,
--ttyname STRING, --ttytype
STRING, --lc-ctype 
STRING, --lc-messages STRING

These options are used to pass
localization information to pinentry-tty. They are
required because pinentry-tty is usually called by
some background process which does not have any information
on the locale and terminal to use. Assuan protocol options
are an alternative way to pass these information.
