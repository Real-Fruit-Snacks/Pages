NAME

containers-certs.d
- Directory for storing custom container-registry TLS
configurations

DESCRIPTION

A custom TLS
configuration for a container registry can be configured by
creating a directory under
$HOME/.config/containers/certs.d or
/etc/containers/certs.d. The name of the directory
must correspond to the host:port of the registry
(e.g., my-registry.com:5000).

Directory Structure

A certs
directory can contain one or more files with the following
extensions:

&bull;

*.crt files with this extensions will be
interpreted as CA certificates

&bull;

*.cert files with this extensions will be
interpreted as client certificates

&bull;

*.key files with this extensions will be
interpreted as client keys

Note that the
client certificate-key pair will be selected by the file
name (e.g., client.{cert,key}). An examplary setup
for a registry running at my-registry.com:5000 may
look as follows:

/etc/containers/certs.d/

&#9492;&#9472;&#9472; my-registry.com:5000 
&#9500;&#9472;&#9472; client.cert 
&#9500;&#9472;&#9472; client.key 
&#9492;&#9472;&#9472; ca.crt
