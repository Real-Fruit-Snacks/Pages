GH-PR-CREATE(1)                GitHub CLI manual               GH-PR-CREATE(1)

NAME
       gh-pr-create - Create a pull request

SYNOPSIS
       gh pr create [flags]

DESCRIPTION
       Create a pull request on GitHub.

       When  the  current  branch isn't fully pushed to a git remote, a prompt
       will ask where to push the branch and offer an option to fork the  base
       repository. Use --head to explicitly skip any forking or pushing behav‚Äê
       ior.

       A prompt will also ask for the title and the body of the pull  request.
       Use  --title  and  --body to skip this, or use --fill to autofill these
       values from git commits.

       Link an issue to the pull request by referencing the issue in the  body
       of  the  pull  request.  If the body text mentions Fixes #123 or Closes
       #123, the referenced issue will automatically get closed when the  pull
       request gets merged.

       By default, users with write access to the base repository can push new
       commits to the head branch of the pull request. Disable this with --no-
       maintainer-edit.

       Adding  a  pull  request  to  projects  requires authorization with the
       "project" scope.  To authorize, run "gh auth refresh -s project".
