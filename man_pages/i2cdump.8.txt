NAME

i2cdump -
examine I2C registers

SYNOPSIS

i2cdump
[-f] [-r first-last] [-y] [-a]
i2cbus address [mode [bank
[bankreg]]] 
i2cdump -V

DESCRIPTION

i2cdump is a
small helper program to examine registers visible through
the I2C bus.

OPTIONS

-V

Display the version and
exit. 

-f

Force access to the device even if it is already busy.
By default, i2cdump will refuse to access a device which is
already under the control of a kernel driver. Using this
flag is dangerous, it can seriously confuse the kernel
driver in question. It can also cause i2cdump to return
invalid results. So use at your own risk and only if you
know what you&rsquo;re doing.

-r first-last

Limit the range of registers
being accessed. This option is not available with mode
s. For mode W, first must be even and
last must be odd.

-y

Disable interactive mode. By default, i2cdump will wait
for a confirmation from the user before messing with the I2C
bus. When this flag is used, it will perform the operation
directly. This is mainly meant to be used in scripts.

-a

Allow using addresses between 0x00 - 0x07 and 0x78 -
0x7f. Not recommended.

At least two
options must be provided to i2cdump. i2cbus indicates
the number or name of the I2C bus to be scanned. This number
should correspond to one of the busses listed by
i2cdetect -l. address indicates the address to
be scanned on that bus, and is an integer between 0x08 and
0x77.

The mode
parameter, if specified, is one of the letters b,
w, s, or i, corresponding to a read
size of a single byte, a 16-bit word, an SMBus block, an I2C
block, respectively. The c mode is a little
different, it reads all bytes consecutively, and is useful
for chips that have an address auto-increment feature, such
as EEPROMs. The W mode is also special, it is similar
to w except that a read command will only be issued
on even register addresses; this is again mainly useful for
EEPROMs.

A p can
also be appended to the mode parameter (except for
i and W) to enable PEC. If the mode
parameter is omitted, i2cdump defaults to byte access
without PEC.

The bank
and bankreg parameters are useful on the W83781D and
similar chips (at the time of writing, all Winbond and Asus
chips). bank is an integer between 0 and 7, and
bankreg is an integer between 0x00 and 0xFF (default
value: 0x4E). The W83781D data sheet has more information on
bank selection.

WARNING

i2cdump can be
dangerous if used improperly. Most notably, the c
mode starts with WRITING a byte to the chip. On most chips
it will be stored in the address pointer register, which is
OK, but some chips with a single register or no (visible)
register at all will most likely see this as a real WRITE,
resulting in possible misbehavior or corruption. Do not use
i2cdump on random addresses. Anyway, it is of little use
unless you have good knowledge of the chip you&rsquo;re
working with and an idea of what you are looking for.

EXAMPLES

Dump the whole
contents of I2C device at 7-bit address 0x50 on bus 9
(i2c-9), using the default read method (byte mode), after
user confirmation:

# i2cdump 9 0x50

Immediately
dump the whole contents of I2C device at 7-bit address 0x50
on bus 9 (i2c-9), using I2C block read transactions (no user
confirmation):

# i2cdump -y 9 0x50 i

If the device is an EEPROM, the
output would typically be the same as output of the previous
example.

Dump registers
0x00 to 0x3f of the I2C device at 7-bit address 0x2d on bus
1 (i2c-1), using the default read method (byte mode), after
user confirmation:

# i2cdump -r 0x00-0x3f 1
0x2d

SMBus block
mode is deprecated and will be removed in a future version
of this tool. Please use i2cget instead.
