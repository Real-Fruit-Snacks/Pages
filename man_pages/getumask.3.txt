NAME

getumask - get
file creation mask

SYNOPSIS

#define
_GNU_SOURCE /* See feature_test_macros(7) */ 
#include  
#include 

mode_t
getumask(void);

DESCRIPTION

This function
returns the current file creation mask. It is equivalent
to

mode_t getumask(void)
{
    mode_t mask = umask( 0 );
    umask(mask);
    return mask;
}

except that it
is documented to be thread-safe (that is, shares a lock with
the umask(2) library call).

CONFORMING TO

This is a
vaporware GNU extension.

NOTES

This function
is documented in the glibc manual, but, as at glibc version
2.24, it is not implemented on Linux. (See umask(2)
for a thread-safe method of discovering a process&rsquo;s
umask.)
