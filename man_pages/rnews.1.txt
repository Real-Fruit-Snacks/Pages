NAME

rnews - receive
news from a UUCP connection

SYNOPSIS

rnews [
-h host ] [ -v ] [ -U ] [
-N ] [ -S master ] [ input ]

DESCRIPTION

Rnews
reads messages typically queued by a UUCP newsfeed and sends
them to the local InterNetNews server. The message is read
from the specified input file, or standard input if no input
is named.

When sent over
UUCP, Usenet articles are typically joined in a single batch
to reduce the UUCP overhead. Batches can also be compressed,
to reduce the communication time. If a message does not
start with a number sign (&rsquo;&rsquo;#&rsquo;&rsquo;) and
an exclamation point, then the entire input is taken as a
single news article. If it does start with with those two
characters, then the first line is read and interpreted as a
batch command.

If the command
is &rsquo;&rsquo;#! rnews nnn&rsquo;&rsquo; where nnn
is a number, then the next nnn bytes (starting with
the next line) are read as a news article.

If the command
is &rsquo;&rsquo;#! cunbatch&rsquo;&rsquo; then the rest of
input is fed to the compress(1) program with the
&rsquo;&rsquo;-d&rsquo;&rsquo; flag to uncompress it, and
the output of this pipe is read as rnews&rsquo;s
input. This is for historical compatibility &mdash; there is
no program named cunbatch. A compressed batch will
start with a &rsquo;&rsquo;#! cunbatch&rsquo;&rsquo; line,
then contain a series of articles separated by
&rsquo;&rsquo;#! rnews nnn&rsquo;&rsquo; lines.

If the command
is any other word, then rnews will try to execute a
program with that name in the directory
/usr/lib/news/rnews. The batch will be fed into the
program&rsquo;s standard input, and the standard output will
be read back as input into rnews.

If rnews
detects any problems with an article such as a missing
header, or an unintelligible reply from the server, it will
save a copy of the article in the
/var/spool/news/in.coming/bad directory.

OPTIONS

-S

If the
&rsquo;&rsquo;-S&rsquo;&rsquo; flag is used, then
rnews will connect to the specified host. If the flag
is not used, it will try to connect to the server by opening
a Unix-domain stream connection. If that fails, it will try
to open a TCP connection to the default remote server.

-U

If the server is not available, the message is spooled
into a new file created in the
/var/spool/news/in.coming directory. The
&rsquo;&rsquo;-U&rsquo;&rsquo; flag may be used to
send all spooled messages to the server once it becomes
available again, and can be invoked regularly by
cron(8). 

-N

Normally, if unpacking the input fails it is re-spooled
to /var/spool/news/in.coming for another attempt
later. If the &rsquo;&rsquo;-N&rsquo;&rsquo; flag is
used then no such re-spooling is done and rnews exits with
status value &rsquo;&rsquo;9&rsquo;&rsquo; to indicate
this. 

-v

If the &rsquo;&rsquo;-v&rsquo;&rsquo; flag is
used, it will print a notice of all errors on the standard
error, naming the input file (if known) and printing the
first few characters of the input. Errors are always logged
through syslog(3).

-h

If the &rsquo;&rsquo;-h&rsquo;&rsquo; flag is
given, or failing that, the enviroment variable
UU_MACHINE is set, then rnews will log the
Message-ID, and host, for each article offered to the server
via syslog(3). Logging will only be done if the value
is not an empty string.

BUGS

Rnews
cannot process articles that have embedded \0&rsquo;s in
them.
