NAME

emacsclient
&minus; tells a running Emacs to visit a file

SYNOPSIS

emacsclient
[options] files ...

DESCRIPTION

This manual
page documents briefly the emacsclient command. Full
documentation is available in the GNU Info format; see
below. This manual page was originally written for the
Debian GNU/Linux distribution, but is not specific to that
system.

emacsclient
works in conjunction with the built-in Emacs server.

You can either
call emacsclient directly or let other programs run
it for you when necessary. On GNU and Unix systems many
programs consult the environment variable EDITOR (sometimes
also VISUAL) to obtain the command used for editing. Thus,
setting this environment variable to
&rsquo;emacsclient&rsquo; will allow these programs to use
an already running Emacs for editing. Other operating
systems might have their own methods for defining the
default editor.

For
emacsclient to work, you need an already running
Emacs with a server. Within Emacs, call the functions
&rsquo;server-start&rsquo; or &rsquo;server-mode&rsquo;.
(Your &rsquo;.emacs&rsquo; file can do this automatically if
you add either &rsquo;(server-start)&rsquo; or
&rsquo;(server-mode 1)&rsquo; to it.)

When
you&rsquo;ve finished editing the buffer, type &rsquo;C-x
#&rsquo; (&rsquo;server-edit&rsquo;). This saves the file
and sends a message back to the &rsquo;emacsclient&rsquo;
program telling it to exit. The programs that use
&rsquo;EDITOR&rsquo; wait for the "editor"
(actually, &rsquo;emacsclient&rsquo;) to exit. &rsquo;C-x
#&rsquo; also checks for other pending external requests to
edit various files, and selects the next such file.

If you set the
variable &rsquo;server-window&rsquo; to a window or a frame,
&rsquo;C-x #&rsquo; displays the server buffer in that
window or in that frame.

OPTIONS

The programs
follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options
starting with two dashes (&rsquo;-&rsquo;). 
&minus;nw, &minus;t, &minus;&minus;tty

open a new Emacs frame on the
current terminal

-c,
&minus;&minus;create-frame

create a new frame instead of
trying to use the current Emacs frame

&minus;e,
&minus;&minus;eval

do not visit files but instead
evaluate the arguments as Emacs Lisp expressions.

&minus;n,
&minus;&minus;no-wait

returns immediately without
waiting for you to "finish" the buffer in
Emacs.

&minus;s,
&minus;&minus;socket-name=FILENAME

use socket named FILENAME for
communication.

&minus;f,
&minus;&minus;server-file=FILENAME

use TCP configuration file
FILENAME for communication. This can also be specified via
the &rsquo;EMACS_SERVER_FILE&rsquo; environment
variable.

&minus;a,
&minus;&minus;alternate-editor=EDITOR

if the Emacs server is not
running, run the specified editor instead. This can also be
specified via the &rsquo;ALTERNATE_EDITOR&rsquo; environment
variable. If the value of EDITOR is the empty string, then
Emacs is started in daemon mode and emacsclient will try to
connect to it.

&minus;d,
&minus;&minus;display=DISPLAY

tell the server to display the
files on the given display.

&minus;V,
&minus;&minus;version

print version information and
exit

&minus;H,
&minus;&minus;help

print this usage information
message and exit
