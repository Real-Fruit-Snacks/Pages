sq key subkey -
Manage Subkeys

SYNOPSIS

sq key
subkey add [OPTIONS] FILE 
sq key subkey revoke [OPTIONS] SUBKEY REASON
MESSAGE

DESCRIPTION

Manage
Subkeys.

Add new subkeys
to an existing key.

SUBCOMMANDS

sq key
subkey add 
Add a newly generated Subkey.

A subkey has
one or more flags. ’--can-sign’ sets the signing
flag, and means that the key may be used for signing.
’--can-authenticate’ sets the authentication
flags, and means that the key may be used for authentication
(e.g., as an SSH key). These two flags may be combined.

’--can-encrypt=storage’
sets the storage encryption flag, and means that the key may
be used for storage encryption.
’--can-encrypt=transport’ sets the transport
encryption flag, and means that the key may be used for
transport encryption. ’--can-encrypt=universal’
sets both the storage and the transport encryption flag, and
means that the key may be used for both storage and
transport encryption. Only one of the encryption flags may
be used and it can not be combined with the signing or
authentication flag.

At least one
flag must be chosen.

When using
’--with-password’, ’sq’ prompts the
user for a password, that is used to encrypt the subkey. The
password for the subkey may be different from that of the
primary key.

Furthermore the
subkey may use one of several available cipher suites, that
can be selected using ’--cipher-suite’.

By default a
new subkey never expires. However, its validity period is
limited by that of the primary key it is added for. Using
the ’--expiry’ argument specific validity
periods may be defined. It allows for providing a point in
time for validity to end or a validity duration.

’sq key
subkey add’ respects the reference time set by the
top-level ’--time’ argument. It sets the
creation time of the subkey to the specified time.

sq key
subkey revoke 
Revoke a subkey.

Creates a
revocation certificate for a subkey.

If
’--revocation-file’ is provided, then that key
is used to create the signature. If that key is different
from the certificate being revoked, this creates a
third-party revocation. This is normally only useful if the
owner of the certificate designated the key to be a
designated revoker.

If
’--revocation-file’ is not provided, then the
certificate must include a certification-capable key.

’sq key
subkey revoke’ respects the reference time set by the
top-level ’--time’ argument. When set, it uses
the specified time instead of the current time, when
determining what keys are valid, and it sets the revocation
certificate’s creation time to the reference time
instead of the current time.

EXAMPLES

sq key
subkey add 
First, generate a key

sq key generate
--userid ’juliet [AT] example.org>’ \

--output juliet.key.pgp

Add a new
Subkey for universal encryption which expires at the same
time as the primary key

sq key subkey
add --output juliet-new.key.pgp \

--can-encrypt universal
juliet.key.pgp

Add a new
Subkey for signing using the rsa3k cipher suite which
expires in five days

sq key subkey
add --output juliet-new.key.pgp --can-sign \

--expiry 5d --cipher-suite
rsa3k juliet.key.pgp
