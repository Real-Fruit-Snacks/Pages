DESCRIPTION

sa
summarizes information about previously executed commands as
recorded in the acct file. In addition, it condenses
this data into a summary file named savacct which
contains the number of times the command was called and the
system resources used. The information can also be
summarized on a per-user basis; sa will save this
information into a file named usracct.

If no arguments
are specified, sa will print information about all of
the commands in the acct file.

If called with
a file name as the last argument, sa will use that
file instead of the system&rsquo;s default acct
file.

By default,
sa will sort the output by sum of user and system
time. If command names have unprintable characters, or are
only called once, sa will sort them into a group
called &rsquo;***other&rsquo;. If more than one sorting
option is specified, the list will be sorted by the one
specified last on the command line.

The output
fields are labeled as follows:

cpu

sum of system and user time in
cpu minutes

re

"elapsed time" in minutes

k

cpu-time averaged core usage, in 1k units

avio

average number of I/O operations per execution

tio

total number of I/O operations

k*sec

cpu storage integral (kilo-core seconds)

u

user cpu time in cpu seconds

s

system time in cpu seconds

Note that these
column titles do not appear in the first row of the table,
but after each numeric entry (as units of measurement) in
every row. For example, you might see &rsquo;79.29re&rsquo;,
meaning 79.29 cpu seconds of "real time".

An asterisk
will appear after the name of commands that forked but
didn&rsquo;t call exec.

GNU sa
takes care to implement a number of features not found in
other versions. For example, most versions of sa
don&rsquo;t pay attention to flags like
&rsquo;--print-seconds&rsquo; and
&rsquo;--sort-num-calls&rsquo; when printing out commands
when combined with the &rsquo;--user-summary&rsquo; or
&rsquo;--print-users&rsquo; flags. GNU sa pays
attention to these flags if they are applicable. Also,
MIPS&rsquo; sa stores the average memory use as a
short rather than a double, resulting in some round-off
errors. GNU sa uses double the whole way through.

OPTIONS

The
availability of these program options depends on your
operating system. In specific, the members that appear in
the struct acct of your system&rsquo;s process
accounting header file (usually acct.h ) determine
which flags will be present. For example, if your
system&rsquo;s struct acct doesn&rsquo;t have the
&rsquo;ac_mem&rsquo; field, the installed version of
sa will not support the
&rsquo;--sort-cpu-avmem&rsquo;, &rsquo;--sort-ksec&rsquo;,
&rsquo;-k&rsquo;, or &rsquo;-K&rsquo; options.

In short, all
of these flags may not be available on your machine. 
-a, --list-all-names

Force sa not to sort
those command names with unprintable characters and those
used only once into the ***other group.

-b,
--sort-sys-user-div-calls

Sort the output by the sum of
user and system time divided by the number of calls.

-c, --percentages

Print percentages of total time
for the command&rsquo;s user, system, and real time
values.

-d, --sort-avio

Sort the output by the average
number of disk I/O operations.

-D, --sort-tio

Print and sort the output by
the total number of disk I/O operations.

-f,
--not-interactive

When using the
&rsquo;--threshold&rsquo; option, assume that all answers to
interactive queries will be affirmative.

-i,
--dont-read-summary-files

Don&rsquo;t read the
information in the system&rsquo;s default savacct
file.

-j, --print-seconds

Instead of printing total
minutes for each category, print seconds per call.

-k, --sort-cpu-avmem

Sort the output by cpu time
average memory usage.

-K, --sort-ksec

Print and sort the output by
the cpu-storage integral.

-l, --separate-times

Print separate columns for
system and user time; usually the two are added together and
listed as &rsquo;cpu&rsquo;.

-m, --user-summary

Print the number of processes
and number of CPU minutes on a per-user basis.

-n, --sort-num-calls

Sort the output by the number
of calls. This is the default sorting method.

-p, --show-paging

Print the number of minor and
major pagefaults and swaps.

-P,
--show-paging-avg

Print the number of minor and
major pagefaults and swaps divided by the number of
calls.

-r, --reverse-sort

Sort output items in reverse
order.

-s, --merge

Merge the summarized accounting
data into the summary files savacct and
usracct.

-t, --print-ratio

For each entry, print the ratio
of real time to the sum of system and user times. If the sum
of system and user times is too small to report--the sum is
zero--&rsquo;*ignore*&rsquo; will appear in this field.

-u, --print-users

For each command in the
accounting file, print the userid and command name. After
printing all entries, quit. *Note*: this flag supersedes all
others.

-v num
--threshold num

Print commands which were
executed num times or fewer and await a reply from
the terminal. If the response begins with &rsquo;y&rsquo;,
add the command to the &rsquo;**junk**&rsquo; group.

--separate-forks

It really doesn&rsquo;t make
any sense to me that the stock version of sa
separates statistics for a particular executable depending
on whether or not that command forked. Therefore, GNU
sa lumps this information together unless this option
is specified.

--ahz hz

Use this flag to tell the
program what AHZ should be (in hertz). This option is
useful if you are trying to view an acct file created
on another machine which has the same byte order and file
format as your current machine, but has a different value
for AHZ.

--debug

Print verbose internal
information.

-V, --version

Print the version number of
sa.

-h, --help

Prints the usage string and
default locations of system files to standard output and
exits.

--sort-real-time

Sort the output by the
"real time" field.

--other-usracct-file
filename

Write summaries by user ID to
filename rather than the system&rsquo;s default
usracct file.

--other-savacct-file
filename

Write summaries by command name
to filename rather than the system&rsquo;s default
SAVACCT file.

--other-acct-file
filename

Read from the file
filename instead of the system&rsquo;s default
ACCT file.

FILES

acct

The raw system wide process accounting file. See
acct(5) for further details.

savacct

A summary of system process
accounting sorted by command.

usracct

A summary of system process
accounting sorted by user ID.

BUGS

There is not yet a wide
experience base for comparing the output of GNU sa
with versions of sa in many other systems. The
problem is that the data files grow big in a short time and
therefore require a lot of disk space.
