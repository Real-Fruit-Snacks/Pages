DESCRIPTION

repl may
be used to reply to a message.

In its simplest
form (with no arguments), repl will set up a
message-form skeleton in reply to the current message in the
current folder, and invoke the whatnow shell.

repl
uses a reply template to construct the draft of the reply. A
reply template is simply an mhl format file (see
mh-format(5) for details).

If the switch
-nogroup is given (it is on by default), then
repl will use the standard forms file
&ldquo;replcomps&rdquo;. This will construct a draft message
that is intended to be sent only to the author of the
message to which you are replying. If a file named
&ldquo;replcomps&rdquo; exists in the user&rsquo;s
nmh directory, it will be used instead of this
default forms file.

The default
reply template &ldquo;replcomps&rdquo; will direct
repl to construct the reply message draft as
follows:

To:
 or  or 

cc:  and  and 

Fcc: {fcc switch} or +outbox 
Subject: Re:  
In-Reply-To:  
References:  
Comments: In-Reply-To  or  or  
message dated  
--------

where field
names enclosed in angle brackets () indicate
the contents of the named field from the message to which
the reply is being made.

By default, the
&ldquo;cc:&rdquo; field is empty. You may selectively add
addresses to this default with the -cc type
switch. This switch takes an argument
(all/to/cc/me) which specifies
who gets added to the default &ldquo;cc:&rdquo; list of the
reply. You may give this switch multiple times (with
different arguments) if you wish to add multiple types of
address.

If the switch
-group is given, then repl will use the
standard forms file &ldquo;replgroupcomps&rdquo;. This will
construct a draft message that is intended as a group or
followup reply. If a file named &ldquo;replgroupcomps&rdquo;
exists in the user&rsquo;s nmh directory, it will be used
instead of this default forms file, unless you specify
another forms file on the command line or in your
profile.

The default
group reply template &ldquo;replgroupcomps&rdquo; will
direct repl to construct the reply message draft as
follows:

To:

Subject: Re:  
In-Reply-To: Message from  of . 

--------

or if the field
 is not available:

To:
 or  or 

cc:  and  and 

Subject: Re:  
In-Reply-To: Message from  of . 

--------

By default, the
&ldquo;cc:&rdquo; contains all the addresses shown. You may
selectively remove addresses from this default with the
-nocc type switch. This switch takes an
argument ( all/to/cc/me) which
specifies who gets removed from the default
&ldquo;cc:&rdquo; list of the reply. You may give this
switch multiple times (with different arguments) if you wish
to remove multiple types of address.

In any case,
you may specify an alternative forms file with the switch
-form formfile.

The
-query switch modifies the action of -nocc
type switch by interactively asking you if each
address that normally would be placed in the
&ldquo;To:&rdquo; and &ldquo;cc:&rdquo; list should actually
be sent a copy. This is useful for special-purpose replies.
Note that the position of the -cc and -nocc
switches, like all other switches which take a positive and
negative form, is important.

Lines beginning
with the fields &ldquo;To:&rdquo;, &ldquo;cc:&rdquo;, and
&rdquo;Bcc:&rdquo; will be standardized and have duplicate
addresses removed. In addition, the -width
columns switch will guide repl&rsquo;s
formatting of these fields.

If the draft
already exists, repl will ask you as to the
disposition of the draft. A reply of quit will abort
repl, leaving the draft intact; replace will
replace the existing draft with a blank skeleton; and
list will display the draft.

See
comp(1) for a description of the -editor and
-noedit switches. Note that while in the editor, with
-atfile and if the current directory is writable, the
message being replied to is available through a link named
&ldquo;@&rdquo; (assuming the default whatnowproc).
In addition, the actual pathname of the message is stored in
the environment variable $editalt, and the pathname
of the folder containing the message is stored in the
environment variable $mhfolder. The creation of the
&ldquo;@&rdquo; file is controlled via the -atfile
and -noatfile options.

The
-convertargs switch directs repl to pass the
arguments for type to mhbuild. Both arguments
are required; type must be non-empty while
argstring can be empty, e.g., &rsquo;&rsquo; in a
shell command line. The -convertargs switch can be
used multiple times. See the Convert Interface section of
mhbuild(1) for a description of the convert
mechanism, and /usr/share/doc/nmh/contrib/replaliases
for examples of its use.

Although
repl uses a forms file to direct it how to construct
the beginning of the draft, it uses a message filter file to
direct it as to how the message to which you are replying
should be filtered (re-formatted) in the body of the draft.
The filter file for repl should be a standard form
file for mhl, as repl will invoke mhl
to format the message to which you are replying.

The switches
-noformat, -format, and -filter
filterfile specify which message filter file to
use.

If the switch
-noformat is given (it is the default) and the
-filter switch is not used, then the message to which
you are replying is not included in the body of the
draft.

If the switch
-format is given, then a default message filter file
is used. This default message filter should be adequate for
most users. This default filter
&ldquo;mhl.reply&rdquo; is:

; mhl.reply

; 
; default message filter for &rsquo;repl&rsquo; (repl
-format) 
; 

from:nocomponent,formatfield="%(unquote(decode(friendly{text})))
writes:" 
body:component="> ",overflowtext=">
",overflowoffset=0

which outputs
each line of the body of the message prefaced with the
&ldquo;>&rdquo; character and a space.

If a file named
&ldquo;mhl.reply&rdquo; exists in the user&rsquo;s
nmh directory, it will be used instead of this form.
You may specify an alternate message filter file with the
switch -filter filterfile.

Other reply
filters are commonly used, such as:

: 
body:nocomponent,compwidth=9,offset=9

which says to
output a blank line, and then the body of the message being
replied to, indented by one tab stop. Another popular format
is:

message-id:nocomponent,nonewline,\

formatfield=&ldquo;In message %{text}, &rdquo; 

from:nocomponent,formatfield=&ldquo;%(decode(friendly{text}))
writes:&rdquo; 

body:component=&ldquo;>&rdquo;,overflowtext=&ldquo;>&rdquo;,overflowoffset=0

This message
filter file cites the Message-ID and author of the message
being replied to, and then outputs each line of the body
prefaced with the &ldquo;>&rdquo; character.

You can also
use an external format program to format the message body.
The format program is specified by the formatproc
profile entry, and is enabled by the &ldquo;format&rdquo;
flag. A message filter using an external format program
would look like this:

body:component=&ldquo;>&rdquo;,nowrap,format

See the
mhl(1) documentation for more information. The format
program can be changed by the -fmtproc program
and -nofmtproc switches.

To use the MIME
rules for encapsulation, specify the -mime switch.
This directs repl to generate an mhbuild
composition file. Note that nmh will not invoke
mhbuild automatically; you must specifically give the
command

What now?
mime

prior to
sending the draft.

If the
-annotate switch is given, the message being replied
to will be annotated with the lines

Replied: date
Replied: addrs

where the
address list contains one line for each addressee. The
annotation will be done only if the message is sent directly
from repl. If the message is not sent immediately
from repl, &ldquo;comp -use&rdquo; may be
used to re-edit and send the constructed message, but the
annotations won&rsquo;t take place. Normally annotations are
done inplace in order to preserve any links to the message.
You may use the -noinplace switch to change this.

Although the
default template specifies that a copy of the reply will be
put in the folder &rsquo;outbox&rsquo;, if the -fcc
+folder switch is given it will override the default
value. More than one folder, each preceded by -fcc
can be named.

In addition to
the standard mh-format(5) escapes, repl also
recognizes the following additional component
escape:

Escape
Returns Description

fcc

string

Any folders specified with
&rsquo;-fcc folder&rsquo; 

To avoid
reiteration, repl strips any leading &rsquo;Re:
&rsquo; strings from the subject component.

The
-draftfolder +folder and -draftmessage
msg switches invoke the nmh draft folder
facility. This is an advanced (and highly useful) feature.
Consult mh-draft(5) for more information.

Upon exiting
from the editor, repl will invoke the whatnow
program. See whatnow(1) for a discussion of available
options. The invocation of this program can be inhibited by
using the -nowhatnowproc switch. (In fact, it is the
whatnow program which starts the initial edit. Hence,
-nowhatnowproc will prevent any edit from
occurring.)

The
-build switch is intended to be used by the Emacs
mh-e interface to nmh. It implies
-nowhatnowproc. It causes a file
/reply to be created, containing the
draft message that would normally be presented to the user
for editing. No mail is actually sent.

The
-file msgfile switch specifies the message to
be replied to as an exact filename rather than as an
nmh folder and message number. The same caveats apply
to this option as to the -build switch.

FILES

repl
looks for all format, filter and template files in multiple
locations: absolute pathnames are accessed directly, tilde
expansion is done on usernames, and files are searched for
in the user&rsquo;s Mail directory as specified in
their profile. If not found there, the directory
&ldquo;/etc/nmh&rdquo; is checked.

/etc/nmh/replcomps

CONTEXT

If a folder is
given, it will become the current folder. The message
replied to will become the current message.

BUGS

If any
addresses occur in the reply template, addresses in the
template that do not contain hosts are defaulted
incorrectly. Instead of using the localhost for the default,
repl uses the sender&rsquo;s host. Moral of the
story: if you&rsquo;re going to include addresses in a reply
template, include the host portion of the address.

The
-width columns switch is only used to do
address-folding; other headers are not line-wrapped.

If
whatnowproc is whatnow, then repl uses
a built-in whatnow, it does not actually run the
whatnow program. Hence, if you define your own
whatnowproc, don&rsquo;t call it whatnow since
repl won&rsquo;t run it.
