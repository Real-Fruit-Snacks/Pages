NAME
       PFM - PFM graphic image file format

DESCRIPTION
       This document describes the PFM graphic image file format as understood
       by the Netpbm converters pamtopfm(1) and pfmtopam(1).

       There are multiple similar formats known as PFM in the world,  none  of
       them authoritatively documented.  The format described here is one that
       Bryan Henderson deduced from a program he found  somewhere  that  dealt
       with a "PFM" format.

       The PFM format is inspired by the Netpbm formats, and you will see lots
       of similarity.  It is not, however, an  official  Netpbm  format.   Its
       goal is not consistent with those of Netpbm formats.

The format
       A PFM image is a stream of bytes.  The stream consists of a header fol‐
       lowed immediately by a raster.  These two components are described  be‐
       low.   There  are  no  delimeters  before  or after the sections as de‐
       scribed.

   PFM header
       The PFM header is 3 consecutive "lines" of ASCII text.  After each line
       is  a  white  space  character.   That character is typically a newline
       character, hence the term "line," but doesn't have to be.

       pamtopfm uses a newline in the PFM it generates.

       Identifier Line

       The identifier line contains the characters "PF"  or  "Pf".   PF  means
       it's a color PFM.  Pf means it's a grayscale PFM.

       Dimensions Line

       The  dimensions  line contains two positive decimal integers, separated
       by a blank.  The first is the width of the image;  the  second  is  the
       height.  Both are in pixels.

       Scale Factor / Endianness

       The Scale Factor / Endianness line is a queer line that jams endianness
       information into an otherwise sane description of a  scale.   The  line
       consists  of  a nonzero decimal number, not necessarily an integer.  If
       the number is negative, that means the PFM  raster  is  little  endian.
       Otherwise,  it  is big endian.  The absolute value of the number is the
       scale factor for the image.

       The scale factor tells the units of the samples in the raster.  You use
       somehow  it  along  with some separately understood unit information to
       turn a sample value into something meaningful, such as watts per square
       meter.

   PFM raster
       The  raster  is a sequence of pixels, packed one after another, with no
       delimiters of any kind.  They are grouped by row, with  the  pixels  in
       each row ordered left to right and the rows ordered bottom to top.

       Each  pixel  consists of 1 or 3 samples, packed one after another, with
       no delimiters of any kind.  1 sample for a grayscale PFM and  3  for  a
       color PFM (see the Identifier Line of the PFM header).

       Each  sample consists of 4 consecutive bytes.  The bytes represent a 32
       bit string, in either big endian or little endian format, as determined
       by  the  Scale Factor / Endianness line of the PFM header.  That string
       is an IEEE 32 bit floating point number code.  Since  that's  the  same
       format  that  most  CPUs  and compiler use, you can usually just make a
       program use the bytes directly as a floating point number, after taking
       care of the endianness variation.
