NAME

processor_bind
− bind LWPs to a processor

SYNOPSIS

#include

#include  
#include 

int
processor_bind(idtype_t idtype,
id_t id, processorid_t
processorid, processorid_t *obind);

DESCRIPTION

The
processor_bind() function binds the LWP
(lightweight process) or set of LWPs specified by
idtype and id to the processor specified by
processorid. If obind is not NULL, this
function also sets the processorid_t variable pointed
to by obind to the previous binding of one of the
specified LWPs, or to PBIND_NONE if the
selected LWP was not bound.

If
idtype is P_PID, the binding affects all
LWPs of the process with process ID
(PID) id.

If
idtype is P_LWPID, the binding affects the
LWP of the current process with LWP ID
id.

If
idtype is P_TASKID, the binding affects all
LWPs of all processes with task ID
id.

If
idtype is P_PROJID, the binding affects all
LWPs of all processes with project ID
id.

If id is
P_MYID, the specified LWP, process, task, or
process is the current one.

If
processorid is PBIND_NONE, the processor
bindings of the specified LWPs are cleared.

If
processorid is PBIND_QUERY, the processor
bindings are not changed.

The effective
user of the calling process must be superuser, or its real
or effective user ID must match the real or effective
user ID of the LWPs being bound. If the
calling process does not have permission to change all of
the specified LWPs, the bindings of the LWPs
for which it does have permission will be changed even
though an error is returned.

Processor
bindings are inherited across fork(2) and
exec(2).

RETURN VALUES

Upon successful
completion, 0 is returned. Otherwise, −1
is returned and errno is set to indicate the
error.

ERRORS

The
processor_bind() function will fail if: 
EFAULT

The location pointed to by
obind was not NULL and not writable by the
user.

EINVAL

The specified processor is not
on-line, or the idtype argument was not P_PID,
P_LWPID, P_PROJID, or P_TASKID.

EPERM

The effective user of the calling process is not
superuser, and its real or effective user ID does not match
the real or effective user ID of one of the
LWPs being bound.

ESRCH

No processes, LWPs, or tasks were found to match
the criteria specified by idtype and id.
