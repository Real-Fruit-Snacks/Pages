sane-hpljm1005(5)        SANE Scanner Access Now Easy        sane-hpljm1005(5)

NAME
       sane-hpljm1005  -  SANE  backend for Hewlett-Packard LaserJet M1005 MFP
       Scanner

DESCRIPTION
       The sane-hpljm1005 library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now  Easy)
       backend that provides access to the following Hewlett-Packard scanner:

              LaserJet M1005

       If  you  own a scanner other than the ones listed above that works with
       this backend, please let us know this by sending  the  scanner's  exact
       model   name   and   the   USB   vendor   and  device  ids  (e.g.  from
       /proc/bus/usb/devices, sane-find-scanner(1) or syslog) to us.  Even  if
       the scanner's name is only slightly different from the models mentioned
       above, please let us know.

CONFIGURATION
       None required.

FILES
       /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-hpljm1005.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-hpljm1005.so
              The shared library implementing this backend (present on systems
              that support dynamic loading).

ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_DEBUG_HPLJM1005
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this en‐
              vironment variable controls the debug level  for  this  backend.
              Higher debug levels increase the verbosity of the output.

              There is not currently a great deal of diagnostic output, it be‐
              ing mainly confined to error conditions.
