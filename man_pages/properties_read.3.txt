NAME

properties_read,
propery_find, properties_free &mdash;
functions to allow creating simple property lists from ASCII
file data

LIBRARY

System Utilities Library
(libutil, &minus;lutil)

SYNOPSIS

#include 

#include 

properties

properties_read(int fd);

char
*

property_find(properties list,
const char *name);

void

properties_free(properties list);

DESCRIPTION

typedef struct _properties {

struct _properties *next;

char *name;

char *value;

} *properties;

The function
properties_read() reads name = value pairs
from the file descriptor passed in fd and returns the
head of a new property list, assuming that the file&rsquo;s
contents have been parsed properly, or NULL in case of
error.

The
property_find() function returns the associated value
string for the property named name if found,
otherwise NULL. The value returned may be up to
PROPERTY_MAX_VALUE bytes in length.

The
properties_free() function is used to free the
structure returned by properties_read() when it is no
longer needed.

FILE FORMAT

Each property in the file is
assumed to have the format of name = value where
name is an alphanumeric string (and any punctuation
not including the &rsquo;=&rsquo; character) and
value is an arbitary string of text terminated by a
newline character. If newlines are desired, the entire value
should be enclosed in { } (curly-bracket) characters. Any
line beginning with a # or ; character is assumed to be a
comment and will be ignored.
