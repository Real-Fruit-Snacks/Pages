NAME

ctrlproxy
− a modular IRC proxy with multi-server support

SYNOPSIS

ctrlproxy
[−d file] [−l file] [−D]

DESCRIPTION

ctrlproxy
is a modular IRC proxy. It connects to a number of IRC
servers and then passes data it receives on to the modules
that have been loaded into it. Current modules are
client_simple (for proxy support) and log (for
irssi−style log file generation).

By default,
ctrlproxy listens for client connections on port 6668 and
any ports after that one, depending on the number of servers
it is connected to.
