NAME

rzip &minus; a
large-file compression program

SYNOPSIS

rzip [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION

rzip is a file
compression program designed to do particularly well on very
large files containing long distance redundancy.

OPTIONS SUMMARY

Here is a
summary of the options to rzip.

&minus;0
fastest (worst) compression 
&minus;6 default compression 
&minus;9 slowest (best) compression 
&minus;d decompress 
&minus;o filename specify the output file name 
&minus;S suffix specify compressed suffix (default
&rsquo;.rz&rsquo;) 
&minus;f force overwrite of any existing files 
&minus;k keep existing files 
&minus;P show compression progress 
&minus;V show version

OPTIONS

-h

Print an options summary
page 

-V

Print the rzip version number

-0..9

Set the compression level from 0 to 9. The default is to
use level 6, which is a reasonable compromise between speed
and compression. The compression level is also strongly
related to how much memory rzip uses, so if you are running
rzip on a machine with limited amounts of memory then you
will probably want to choose a smaller level.

-d

Decompress. If this option is not used then rzip looks
at the name used to launch the program. If it contains the
string &rsquo;runzip&rsquo; then the &minus;d option is
automatically set.

-o

Set the output file name. If this option is not set then
the output file name is chosen based on the input name and
the suffix. The &minus;o option cannot be used if more than
one file name is specified on the command line.

-S

Set the compression suffix. The default is
&rsquo;.rz&rsquo;. 

-f

If this option is not specified then rzip will not
overwrite any existing files. If you set this option then
rzip will silently overwrite any files as needed.

-k

If this option is not specified then rzip will delete
the source file after successful compression or
decompression. When this option is specified then the source
files are not deleted.

-P

If this option is specified then rzip will show the
percentage progress while compressing.

INSTALLATION

Just install
rzip in your search path.

COMPRESSION ALGORITHM

rzip operates
in two stages. The first stage finds and encodes large
chunks of duplicated data over potentially very long
distances (up to nearly a gigabyte) in the input file. The
second stage is to use a standard compression algorithm
(bzip2) to compress the output of the first stage.

The key
difference between rzip and other well known compression
algorithms is its ability to take advantage of very long
distance redundancy. The well known deflate algorithm used
in gzip uses a maximum history buffer of 32k. The block
sorting algorithm used in bzip2 is limited to 900k of
history. The history buffer in rzip can be up to 900MB long,
several orders of magnitude larger than gzip or bzip2.

It is quite
common these days to need to compress files that contain
long distance redundancies. For example, when compressing a
set of home directories several users might have copies of
the same file, or of quite similar files. It is also common
to have a single file that contains large duplicated chunks
over long distances, such as pdf files containing repeated
copies of the same image. Most compression programs
won&rsquo;t be able to take advantage of this redundancy,
and thus might achieve a much lower compression ratio than
rzip can achieve.

HISTORY

The ideas
behind rzip were first implemented in 1998 while I was
working on rsync. That version was too slow to be practical,
and was replaced by this version in 2003.

BUGS

Unlike most
Unix compression programs, rzip cannot compress or
decompress to or from standard input or standard output.
This is due to the nature of the algorithm that rzip uses
and cannot easily be fixed.
