NAME

faxspool -
queue and convert files for faxing with sendfax(8)

SYNOPSIS

faxspool
[options] phone-number files...

DESCRIPTION

Queue the named
files for later transmission with sendfax(8). The
input files are converted to G3 fax files, spooled to
/var/spool/fax/outgoing//f*.g3, and queued for
transmsssion to the fax address
"phone-number".

On top of each
page, faxspool puts a header line, telling the other
side the number of pages, your fax id, ..., whatever you
like. The format of this line is configurable via the file
/etc/mgetty/faxheader and per-user via the file
$HOME/.faxheader. (you can select another one with
the "-h" option, for example, one for your
business faxes and one for the private stuff).

This file
should contain a few lines of text, normally only one line,
but more than one line is permitted. The text may use the
tokens @T@ for the remote telephone number, @U@ for the
sending user name, @N@ for his full name (fifth field of
/etc/passwd, if not given with "-F"), @P@ for the
page number and @M@ for the total number of pages. @D@ will
be replaced by the string specified with the "-D"
option (see below), @DATE@ will be substituted by the output
of the &rsquo;date&rsquo; command, and @ID@ stands for the
sender&rsquo;s fax number (FAX_STATION_ID). Finally, @S@
will be substituted by the JOB ID (Fxxxxxx).

If
"phone-number" contains non-numeric characters,
faxspool interprets it as an alias and tries to look
it up in the files /etc/mgetty/faxaliases and
$HOME/.faxnrs. These files have a very simple format:
one line per alias, alias name first, whitespace (tab or
blank), phone number. Optionally, you can place a short
description of the receiver after the phone number, this
will be used as if it had been specified with "-D"
(an explicit "-D" flag overrides this).

Access control
is handled similar to the way "crontab" does it:
if a file /etc/mgetty/fax.allow exists, only those users
listed in that file (one name per line) may use the fax
service. If it does not exist, but a file
/etc/mgetty/fax.deny exists, all users but those listed in
that file may use faxspool(1), and if neither file exists,
only root may send faxes. (Note: if the user name in the
fax.allow file is followed by a blank, the rest of that line
is ignored. Some other fax spooling software uses this to
store additional information about the user sending the
request).

Optionally,
faxspool can generate user-customizable fax cover
pages. It is quite easy to set up: if a file
/etc/mgetty/make.coverpg exists and is executable, it is run
with all relevant source/destination data on the command
line, and its output is sent as the first page of the
resulting fax. If $HOME/.make.coverpg exists, this file is
used instead. See coverpg(1) for details.

OPTIONS

-n

Tells faxspool to use
normal resolution (as opposed to the default, fine
resolution) both when converting files to G3 format and when
transmitting (no effect on pbm files)

-h 

Use 
for the FAX header line(s). The default format file for
faxspool is /etc/mgetty/faxheader. &rsquo;-&rsquo;
means &rsquo;no header line&rsquo;.

-q

do not output progress messages (file ... is format ...,
spooling to ...). Error messages will be seen anyway.

-f 

Use the address given for the
status mail that faxrunq(1) sends after completing /
dequeueing the request. If no mail address is specified, the
requesting user (on the local machine) gets the mail.

-u 

Do not use the current user ID
for authentication purposes but the user name specified.
Since this can lead to easy breach of security, only
"trusted" users may use this flag. Currently,
those users are "root", "lp" and
"daemon" (hardwired into the code). Note: the
status mail will still go to the user running faxspool(1)
unless changed with "-f".

-D

Verbose form of the fax&rsquo;s
destination. Used only for informational purposes, that is,
faxq(1) will show it, faxrunq(1) will put it into the return
mail ("Subject: your fax to ..."), and a @D@ in
the page header will be replaced by it.

-F

Full name or similar
description of the sending user (if not specified, the full
name field from /etc/passwd will be used). Used only for
informational purposes, that is, faxspool(1) will substitute
a @N@ in the page header file with it, and it will be passed
to the cover page program (if used) as
.

-P 

Sets the priority of the fax in
the queue. 9 is highest (meaning: faxes get sent out first),
1 is lowest. If nothing is specified, a default value of 5
is used. Right now, only faxrunqd understands
priority, faxrunq will silently ignore it.

-C 

Specify that the named program
is to be used to generate a cover page for the fax that is
being queued. How the program is called is described in the
coverpg(1) manpage.

The special
program name "-" is used to specify "no
coverpage at all".

No message is
issued if the program isn&rsquo;t found, or cannot be
executed, faxspool will simply queue the fax without cover
page.

The default
cover page program used is $HOME/.make.coverpg; if this file
doesn&rsquo;t exist /etc/mgetty/make.coverpg is used.
(However, if $HOME/.make.coverpg exists, but is not
executable, no coverpage is used at all.)

-p

Spool a request that will try polling (see "sendfax
-p"). The implementation isn&rsquo;t too smart yet, the
polled files will simply go into the job&rsquo;s spool
directory. 

-t 

Don&rsquo;t send the fax before
the time given. It may not be sent exactly at ,
but the first time faxrunq runs after that time. If
the fax cannot be sent successfully before midnight, it
won&rsquo;t be sent on the next day until !

-t
-

Only send the fax in the time
range between those two times. This is only implemented in
faxrunqd. If the second time specified is
&rsquo;earlier&rsquo; than the first time, it is interpreted
as a time range crossing midnight.

-A 

pass faxspool a chunk of data
that is ignored (so you can put anything you want here), but
written to all the log files (acct.log, sendfax.log). This
can be used to tag faxes as private/corporate, to tag faxes
with the customer ID to use for billing, or something along
that lines.

-m 
  ... --

Multicasting - send the
specified files to all phone numbers in the list given after
"-m". The list is terminated with "--".
"-m" has to be the last option on the command line
(not implemented yet).

-M 

Multicasting - read a list of
telephone numbers to send the fax to from the given file. Do
not use in conjunction with "-m" (not implemented
yet).

-c

Copy source files to a sub directory
".source-files/" in the fax queue directory (most
likely, you won&rsquo;t ever need this - I needed it for one
project, so it&rsquo;s here and documented. Don&rsquo;t ask
what it&rsquo;s good for).

FILES

/var/spool/fax/outgoing/*

fax spool directory

/etc/mgetty/faxaliases

global fax alias file

$HOME/.faxnrs

private fax alias file

/etc/mgetty/fax.allow

list of allowed users

/etc/mgetty/fax.deny

list of denied users

/etc/mgetty/faxheader

/etc/mgetty/make.coverpg

program to create fax cover
page (see coverpg(1)).

/etc/mgetty/faxspool.rules

extentions are recognized (.txt, .ps, ...) and how those
file formats should be converted to G3.

/usr/lib/mgetty-fax/faxq-helper

this a small C helper program
that facilitates access to the fax spool queue (which is
since mgetty 1.1.29 no longer world-writeable)

BUGS

faxspool
is not too smart about recognizing file types

Use of
faxspool -n with bitmap files may give wrong results,
depending on the aspect ratio of the input files.

Multicasting
with the -m and -M options is not implemented yet.
