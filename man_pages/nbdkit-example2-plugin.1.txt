DESCRIPTION

nbdkit plugins (nbdkit-plugin(3)).

There are two
variations of this plugin which can be found in the source
directory. example2.c is the regular plugin for Linux
and other Unix-like systems. winexample2.c is the
same plugin written for Windows using Win32 APIs to access
the file.

debugging (only useful for developers) use
