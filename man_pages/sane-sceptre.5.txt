NAME
       sane-sceptre - SANE backend for SCEPTRE scanners

DESCRIPTION
       The  sane-sceptre  library  implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy)
       backend that provides access to Sceptre flatbed scanners. This  backend
       should  be  considered beta-quality software! Please report any strange
       behavior to the maintainer of the backend or to the SANE mailing list.

       At present, only one scanner is known to work with this backend:

              Model                        Connection Type
              ---------------------------  -------------------
              Sceptre VividScan S1200      SCSI

       The make of this scanner is KINPO, so other scanners from that manufac‐
       turer may also work (eg. the S600).

OPTIONS
       The options the backend supports can either be selected through command
       line options to programs like scanimage(1) or through GUI  elements  in
       xscanimage(1) or xsane(1).

       Valid command line options and their syntax can be listed by using

              scanimage --help -d sceptre

       Scan Mode

       --mode Lineart|Halftone|Gray|Color
              Selects the basic mode of operation of the scanner.  The Lineart
              and Halftone mode are black and white only (1 bit).   Gray  will
              produce  256  levels  of gray (8 bits).  Color will produce a 24
              bits color image. The scanner supports 30 bits internally but it
              only exports 24.

       --resolution 50..1200
              Selects  the  resolution  for a scan. The scanner can do several
              resolutions between 50 and 1200.

       --halftone-pattern 1|2|3|4
              Selects the pattern mode that is used in Halftone mode.

       --gamma-correction Default|User Defined|High Density Printing|Low  den‐
       sity printing|High contrast printing
              controls the scanner internal gamma correction.

       --custom-gamma
              Allows the user to specify a gamma table (see the next 3 parame‐
              ters).  Color mode only.

       --red-gamma-table
              Can be used to download a user defined gamma table for  the  red
              channel. The table must be 256 bytes long.  Color mode only.

       --green-gamma-table
              Can be used to download a user defined gamma table for the green
              channel. The table must be 256 bytes long.  Color mode only.

       --blue-gamma-table
              Can be used to download a user defined gamma table for the  blue
              channel. The table must be 256 bytes long.  Color mode only.

       --threshold 0..255
              Sets  the  threshold for black and white pixels in Lineart mode.
              Possible values are from 0 (darker) to 255 (lighter).

       --preview
              Requests a preview scan. The resolution used for that scan is 30
              dpi  and  the scan area is the maximum allowed. The scan mode is
              user selected. The default is "no".

       The geometry options

       -l -t -x -y
              control the scan area: -l sets the top left x coordinate, -t the
              top left y coordinate, -x selects the width and -y the height of
              the scan area. All parameters are specified  in  millimeters  by
              default.

CONFIGURATION FILE
       The configuration file /etc/sane.d/sceptre.conf supports only one item:
       the device name to use (eg /dev/scanner).

FILES
       /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-sceptre.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-sceptre.so
              The shared library implementing this backend (present on systems
              that support dynamic loading).

ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_DEBUG_SCEPTRE
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this en‐
              vironment variable controls the debug level  for  this  backend.
              E.g.,  a  value  of 128 requests all debug output to be printed.
              Smaller levels reduce verbosity.

LIMITATIONS
       Resolutions
              The windows TWAIN driver can be set to any resolution between 50
              to 1200 (excluding software interpolation). This backend cannot.
              Only a handful of resolution are available, although they should
              be numerous enough.

BUGS
       None known.
