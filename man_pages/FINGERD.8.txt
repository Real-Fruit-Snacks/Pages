FINGERD(8) BSD System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
FINGERD(8)

NAME

fingerd &mdash; remote
user information server

SYNOPSIS

fingerd
[&minus;s] [&minus;l]
[&minus;p filename]

DESCRIPTION

The fingerd utility uses
a simple protocol based on RFC1196 that provides an
interface to finger(1) at several network sites. It is
supposed to return a friendly, human-oriented status report
on either the system at the moment or a particular person in
depth. There is no required format and the protocol consists
mostly of specifying a single &rsquo;&rsquo;command
line&rsquo;&rsquo;, thus, fingerd can also be used to
implement other protocols in conjunction with the
&minus;p flag.

The
fingerd utility is started by inetd(8), which listens
for TCP requests at port 79. Once connected it reads a
single command line terminated by a &lang; CRLF&rang; which
is passed to finger(1). The fingerd utility closes
its connections as soon as the output is finished.

If the line is
null (i.e., just a &lang; CRLF&rang; is sent) then finger(1)
returns a &rsquo;&rsquo;default&rsquo;&rsquo; report that
lists all people logged into the system at that moment.

If a user name
is specified (e.g. eric&lang; CRLF&rang; ) then the response
lists more extended information for only that particular
user, whether logged in or not. Allowable
&rsquo;&rsquo;names&rsquo;&rsquo; in the command line
include both &rsquo;&rsquo;login names&rsquo;&rsquo; and
&rsquo;&rsquo;user names&rsquo;&rsquo;. If a name is
ambiguous, all possible derivations are returned.

The following
options may be passed to fingerd as server program
arguments in /etc/inetd.conf:

&minus;s

Enable secure
mode. Queries without a user name are rejected and
forwarding of queries to other remote hosts is denied.

&minus;l

Enable logging.
The name of the host originating the query is reported via
syslog(3) at LOG_NOTICE priority.

&minus;p

Use an
alternate program as the local information provider. The
default local program executed by fingerd is
finger(1). By specifying a customized local server, this
option allows a system manager to have more control over
what information is provided to remote sites. If
&minus;p is specified, fingerd will also set
the environment variable FINGERD_REMOTE_HOST to the name of
the host making the request.

BUGS

Connecting directly to the
server from a TIP or an equally narrow-minded
TELNET&minus;protocol user program can result in meaningless
attempts at option negotiation being sent to the server,
which will foul up the command line interpretation. The
fingerd utility should be taught to filter out
IAC&acute;s and perhaps even respond negatively (IAC
WON&rsquo;T) to all option commands received.
