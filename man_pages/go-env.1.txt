GO-ENV(1)                   General Commands Manual                  GO-ENV(1)

NAME
       go-env - print Go environment information

SYNOPSIS
       go env [ var ...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       Env prints Go environment information.

       By  default  env  prints  information  as a shell script (on Windows, a
       batch file). If one or more variable names is given as  arguments,  env
       prints the value of each named variable on its own line.

       -json  prints  the  environment  in  JSON  format instead of as a shell
              script.

       -u     requires one or more arguments and unsets  the  default  setting
              for  the  named  environment variables, if one has been set with
              ‘go env -w’.

       -w     requires one or  more  arguments  of  the  form  NAME=VALUE  and
              changes  the default settings of the named environment variables
              to the given values.

       For more about environment variables, see ‘go help environment’.
