PR

DESCRIPTION

edit-pr
is used to make changes to existing PRs in a GNATS
database.

edit-pr
first examines the PR and locks it if it is not
already locked. This is to prevent a PR from being edited by
two users simultaneously. If the PR is already in the
process of being edited, edit-pr displays the name of
the person who owns the lock.

edit-pr
then calls $EDITOR on PR. After the PR has
been edited, it is resubmitted to the database, and the
index is updated.

If you change a
field that requires a reason for the change, edit-pr
prompts you to supply a reason for the change. A message is
then appended to the Audit-Trail field of PR with the
changed values and the change reason.

Depending on
how the database is configured, editing various fields in
the PR may also cause mail to be sent concerning these
changes. In the default configuration, any fields that
generate Audit-Trail entries will cause a copy of the new
Audit-Trail message to be sent.

OPTIONS

-h,
--help

Prints a brief usage message
for edit-pr.

-V, --version

Prints the version number for
edit-pr.

-d,
--database

Specifies the database
containing the PR to be edited; if no database is specified,
the database named default is assumed. This option
overrides the database specified in the GNATSDB
environment variable.

GNATS
network options: 
-H, --host

Hostname of the GNATS
server.

-P, --port

The port that the GNATS server
runs on.

-v,
--username

Username used to log into the
GNATS server.

-w, --passwd

Password used to log into the
GNATS server.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

The environment
variable EDITOR specifies the editor to invoke on the
PR. Default is vi(1). 
The GNATSDB environment variable is used to determine
which database to

use. For a local database, it
contains the name of the database to access.

For network
access via gnatsd, it contains a colon-separated list
of strings that describe the remote database, in the form

server:port:databasename:username:password

Any of the
fields may be omitted, but at least one colon must appear;
otherwise, the value is assumed to be the name of a local
database.

If
GNATSDB is not set, it is assumed that the database
is local and that its name is default.

FILES

Temporary file for PR being
edited.

message, if needed.
