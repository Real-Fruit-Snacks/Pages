NAME

DELETE &minus;
delete rows of a table

SYNOPSIS

DELETE FROM [
ONLY ] table [ WHERE condition ]

DESCRIPTION

DELETE
deletes rows that satisfy the WHERE clause from the
specified table. If the WHERE clause is absent, the effect
is to delete all rows in the table. The result is a valid,
but empty table.

Tip:
TRUNCATE [truncate(7)] is a PostgreSQL extension
which provides a faster mechanism to remove all rows from a
table.

By default,
DELETE will delete rows in the specified table and
all its subtables. If you wish to only delete from the
specific table mentioned, you must use the ONLY clause.

You must have
the DELETE privilege on the table to delete from it, as well
as the SELECT privilege for any table whose values are read
in the condition.

PARAMETERS

table

The name (optionally
schema-qualified) of an existing table.

condition

A value expression that returns
a value of type boolean that determines the rows
which are to be deleted.

OUTPUTS

On successful
completion, a DELETE command returns a command tag of
the form

DELETE
count

The
count is the number of rows deleted. If count
is 0, no rows matched the condition (this is not
considered an error).

EXAMPLES

Delete all
films but musicals:

DELETE FROM
films WHERE kind <> &rsquo;Musical&rsquo;;

Clear the table
films:

DELETE FROM
films;

COMPATIBILITY

This command
conforms to the SQL standard.
