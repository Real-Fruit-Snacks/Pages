NAME

git-annex-proxy
- safely bypass direct mode guard (deprecated)

SYNOPSIS

git annex proxy
-- git cmd [options]

DESCRIPTION

This command
was for use in a direct mode repository, and such
repositories are automatically updated to use an adjusted
unlocked branch. So, there&rsquo;s no reason to use this
command any longer.
