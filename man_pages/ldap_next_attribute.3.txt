NAME

ldap_first_attribute,
ldap_next_attribute - step through LDAP entry attributes

LIBRARY

OpenLDAP LDAP
(libldap, -lldap)

SYNOPSIS

#include

char
*ldap_first_attribute(

LDAP *ld, LDAPMessage *entry, BerElement **berptr
) 

char
*ldap_next_attribute(

LDAP *ld, LDAPMessage *entry, BerElement *ber
) 

int
ldap_get_attribute_ber(

LDAP *ld, LDAPMessage *entry, BerElement
*ber, 

BerValue *attr, BerVarray *vals )

DESCRIPTION

The
ldap_first_attribute(), ldap_next_attribute()
and ldap_get_attribute_ber() routines are used to
step through the attributes in an LDAP entry.
ldap_first_attribute() takes an entry as
returned by ldap_first_entry(3) or
ldap_next_entry(3) and returns a pointer to character
string containing the first attribute description in the
entry. ldap_next_attribute() returns the next
attribute description in the entry.

It also
returns, in berptr, a pointer to a BerElement it has
allocated to keep track of its current position. This
pointer should be passed to subsequent calls to
ldap_next_attribute() and is used to effectively step
through the entry&rsquo;s attributes. The caller is solely
responsible for freeing the BerElement pointed to by
berptr when it is no longer needed by calling
ber_free(3). When calling ber_free(3) in this
instance, be sure the second argument is 0.

The attribute
names returned are suitable for inclusion in a call to
ldap_get_values(3) to retrieve the attribute&rsquo;s
values.

The
ldap_get_attribute_ber() routine allows one to
iterate over all attributes in-place, without allocating
memory to hold text for the attribute name or its values, if
requested. The use case is similar to
ldap_next_attribute() except that the attribute name
is returned into attr and, if vals is
non-NULL, the list of values is stored there. Both point
into the LDAP message and remain valid only while the entry
is valid. The caller is still responsible for freeing
vals with ldap_memfree(3), if used.

ERRORS

If an error
occurs, NULL is returned and the ld_errno field in the
ld parameter is set to indicate the error. See
ldap_error(3) for a description of possible error
codes.

NOTES

The
ldap_first_attribute() and
ldap_next_attribute() return dynamically allocated
memory that must be freed by the caller via
ldap_memfree(3). For ldap_get_attribute_ber(),
only the actual vals pointer needs to be freed with
ldap_memfree(3), other data is accounted for as part
of ber.
