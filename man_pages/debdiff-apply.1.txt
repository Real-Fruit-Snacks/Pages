NAME

debdiff-apply -
apply a debdiff to a Debian source package

SYNOPSIS

debdiff-apply
[options] [orig_dsc_or_dir] [patch_file] 
debdiff-apply [options] 

DESCRIPTION

debdiff-apply
takes a patchfile that describes the differences
between two Debian source packages old and
new, and applies it to a target Debian source package
orig.

orig
could either be the same as old or it could be
different. patchfile is expected to be a unified diff
between two Debian source trees, as what debdiff(1)
normally generates.

Any changes to
debian/changelog are dealt with specially, to avoid
the conflicts that changelog diffs typically produce when
applied naively. The exact behaviour may be tweaked in the
future, so one should not rely on it.

If
patchfile does not apply to orig, even after
the special-casing of debian/changelog, no changes
are made and debdiff-apply(1) will exit with a
non-zero error code.

ARGUMENTS

orig_dsc_or_dir

Target to apply the patch to.
This can either be an unpacked source tree, or a .dsc file.
In the former case, the directory is modified in-place; in
the latter case, a second .dsc is created. Default:
.

patch_file

Patch file to apply, in the
format output by debdiff(1). Default:
/dev/stdin

OPTIONS

-h,
--help

show this help message and
exit

-v, --verbose

Output more information

-c CHANGELOG,
--changelog CHANGELOG

Path to debian/changelog;
default: debian/changelog

-D DISTRIBUTION,
--distribution DISTRIBUTION

Distribution to use, if the
patch doesn’t already contain a changelog; default:
experimental

--repl

Run the python REPL after processing.

--source-version

Don’t apply the patch;
instead print out the version of the package that it is
supposed to be applied to, or nothing if the patch does not
specify a source version.

--target-version

Don’t apply the patch;
instead print out the new version of the package
debdiff-apply(1) would generate, when the patch is
applied to the the given target package, as specified by the
other arguments.

For .dsc
patch targets: 
--no-clean

Don’t clean temporary
directories after a failure, so you can examine what
failed.

--quilt-refresh

If the building of the new
source package fails, try to refresh patches using
quilt(1) then try building it again.

-d DIRECTORY,
--directory DIRECTORY

Extract the .dsc into this
directory, which won’t be cleaned up after
debdiff-apply(1) exits. If not given, then it will be
extracted to a temporary directory.
