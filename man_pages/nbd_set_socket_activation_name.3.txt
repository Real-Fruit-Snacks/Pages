NAME

nbd_set_socket_activation_name
- set the socket activation name

SYNOPSIS

#include

int nbd_set_socket_activation_name ( 
struct nbd_handle *h, const char *socket_name 
);

DESCRIPTION

When running an
NBD server using
nbd_connect_systemd_socket_activation(3) you can
optionally name the socket. Call this function before
connecting to the server.

Some servers
such as qemu-storage-daemon(1) can use this
information to associate the socket with a name used on the
command line, but most servers will ignore it. The name is
passed through the "LISTEN_FDNAMES" environment
variable.

The parameter
"socket_name" can be a short alphanumeric string.
If it is set to the empty string (also the default when the
handle is created) then the name "unknown" will be
seen by the server.

RETURN VALUE

If the call is
successful the function returns 0.

ERRORS

On error -1 is
returned.

Refer to
"ERROR HANDLING" in libnbd(3) for how to
get further details of the error.

The following
parameters must not be NULL: "h",
"socket_name". For more information see
"Non-NULL parameters" in libnbd(3).
