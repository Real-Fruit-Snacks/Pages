NAME

rc.news - Start
or stop INN daemons

SYNOPSIS

rc.news
["start" | "stop"]

DESCRIPTION

rc.news
can be used to start or stop innd and supporting
programs. It checks to make sure INN is not already running,
handles cases of unclean shutdown, finishes up tasks which
might have been interrupted by the preceding shutdown,
e-mails certain boot-time warnings to newsmaster (as
set in inn.conf), and is generally safer and easier
than starting and stopping everything directly. It needs to
be run as the news user so that files in pathrun are
created with the right ownership (though this is less
important for "rc.news stop").

Programs run
and stopped by this script include:

&bull;

Always: innd is started or stopped.

&bull;

If doinnwatch is true in inn.conf:
innwatch is started and stopped.

&bull;

If docnfsstat is true in inn.conf:
cnfsstat is started and stopped.

&bull;

If ovmethod is set to "ovdb" in
inn.conf: ovdb_init is run; ovdb_server
and ovdb_monitor are stopped.

&bull;

If ovmethod is set to "ovsqlite" in
inn.conf: ovsqlite-server is started and
stopped. 

&bull;

If rc.news.local exists in pathbin:
rc.news.local is run with argument "start"
or "stop" (to perform site-specific startup or
shutdown tasks).

&bull;

When started, if INN appears to have previously been
shut down during its expiry process, run expirerm if
there are articles to unlink.

&bull;

When started, if overview data appears to have just been
rebuilt and active needs to be renumbered, then
actually renumber it.

OPTIONS

"start"

If the first argument is
"start", or no first argument is given,
rc.news initiates INN startup.

"stop"

If the first argument is
"stop", rc.news initiates INN shutdown.

EXAMPLES

To start INN
and leave certain error messages going to the terminal:

su news -s
/bin/sh -c /rc.news

To run INN at
startup time from appropriate system boot scripts:

su news -s
/bin/sh -c /rc.news >>
/rc.news 2>&1

To stop
INN:

su news -s
/bin/sh -c '/rc.news stop'
