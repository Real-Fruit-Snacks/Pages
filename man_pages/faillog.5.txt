描述
       /var/log/faillog maintains a count of login failures and the limits for
       each account.

       The file contains fixed length records, indexed by numerical UID. Each
       record contains the count of login failures since the last successful
       login; the maximum number of failures before the account is disabled;
       the line on which the last login failure occurred; the date of the last
       login failure; and the duration (in seconds) during which the account
       will be locked after a failure.

                short   fail_cnt;
                short   fail_max;
                char    fail_line[12];
                time_t  fail_time;
                long    fail_locktime;
           };
