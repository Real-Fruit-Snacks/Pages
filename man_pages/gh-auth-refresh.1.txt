NAME
       gh-auth-refresh - Refresh stored authentication credentials

SYNOPSIS
       gh auth refresh [flags]

DESCRIPTION
       Expand or fix the permission scopes for stored credentials.

       The  --scopes  flag  accepts  a comma separated list of scopes you want
       your gh credentials to have. If absent, this command  ensures  that  gh
       has access to a minimum set of scopes.

OPTIONS
       -h, --hostname <string>
              The GitHub host to use for authentication

       -s, --scopes <strings>
              Additional authentication scopes for gh to have

EXAMPLE
              $ gh auth refresh --scopes write:org,read:public_key
              # => open a browser to add write:org and read:public_key scopes for use with gh api

              $ gh auth refresh
              # => open a browser to ensure your authentication credentials have the correct minimum scopes
