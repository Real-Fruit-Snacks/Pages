ISER(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual ISER(4)

NAME

iser &mdash; iSCSI
Extensions for RDMA (iSER) driver

SYNOPSIS

To compile this driver into the
kernel, place the following line in the kernel configuration
file:

device
iser

Alternatively,
to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following line in loader.conf(5):

iser_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION

The iser (iSCSI
Extensions for RDMA) initiator driver extends the iSCSI
protocol to RDMA. It permits data to be transferred directly
into and out of SCSI buffers without intermediate data
copies. iSER uses the RDMA protocol suite to supply higher
bandwidth for block storage transfers (zero copy behavior).
To that fact, it eliminates the TCP/IP processing overhead
while preserving the compatibility with iSCSI protocol. The
initiator is the iSCSI/iSER client, which connects to an
iSCSI/iSER target, providing local access to a remote block
device. The userland component is provided by iscsid(8) and
both the kernel and userland are configured using
iscsictl(8).

SYSCTL VARIABLES

The following variables are
available as both sysctl(8) variables and loader(8)
tunables:

kern.iser.debug

Verbosity level for log
messages from the iser driver. Set to 0 to disable
logging or 1 to warn about potential problems. Larger values
enable info and debugging output. Defaults to 0.
