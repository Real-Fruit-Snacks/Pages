DCONS(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual DCONS(4)

NAME

dcons &mdash; dumb
console device driver

SYNOPSIS

To compile this driver into the
kernel, place the following lines in your kernel
configuration file:

options GDB

device firewire 
device dcons

Alternatively,
to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following line in your kernel configuration file:

options
GDB

and in
loader.conf(5):

dcons_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION

The dcons device is a
simple console device which just reads from and writes to an
allocated buffer for input and output respectively. It is of
no use by itself and it is supposed that the buffer is
accessed via a bus like firewire(4) or kvm(3) for
interaction.

The buffer
consists of 4 channels. There are 2 ports, one for the
console TTY and another is GDB port, then each port has an
input channel and an output channel.

FILES 
/dev/dcons 
/etc/ttys

EXAMPLES

If you want to run getty(8) on
dcons, insert the following line into ttys(5) and
send a HUP signal to init(8) using kill(1).

dcons
"/usr/libexec/getty std.9600" vt100 on secure

Once the
fwohci(4) device is initialized to allow physical access,
the buffer can be accessed from another host via a
firewire(4) bus using the dconschat(8) application. See
dconschat(8) for more details.

If you want to
use dcons as a gdb(1) port, add the following line
into loader.conf(5):

dcons_gdb="1"
