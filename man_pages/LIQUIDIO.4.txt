LIQUIDIO(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual LIQUIDIO(4)

NAME

liquidio &mdash; Cavium
10Gb/25Gb Ethernet driver for the FreeBSD operating
system

SYNOPSIS

To compile this driver into the
kernel, place the following line in your kernel
configuration file:

device
lio

Alternatively,
to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following line in loader.conf(5):

if_lio_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION

The liquidio driver
provides support for 23XX 10Gb/25Gb Ethernet adapters. The
driver supports Jumbo Frames, Transmit/Receive checksum
offload, TCP segmentation offload (TSO), Large Receive
Offload (LRO), VLAN tag insertion/extraction, VLAN checksum
offload, VLAN TSO, and Receive Side Steering (RSS)

Support for
Jumbo Frames is provided via the interface MTU setting.
Selecting an MTU larger than 1500 bytes with the ifconfig(8)
utility configures the adapter to receive and transmit Jumbo
Frames. The maximum MTU size for Jumbo Frames is 16000.

For more
information on configuring this device, see ifconfig(8).

HARDWARE

The liquidio driver
supports the following cards:

&bull;

LiquidIO II CN2350
210SV/225SV

&bull;

LiquidIO II CN2360
210SV/225SV

LOADER TUBABLES

Tunables can be set at the
loader(8) prompt before booting the kernel or stored in
loader.conf(5).

hw.lio.fw_type

String that
specifies type of firmware to be loaded. Default is
"nic". Use "none" to load firmware from
flash.

hw.lio.num_queues_per_pf0

Unsigned
integers that specify number of queues per PF0. Valid range
is 0 to 64. Use 0 to derive autoconfigures based on the
number of cpus with a max of 8

hw.lio.num_queues_per_pf1

Unsigned
integers that specify number of queues per PF1. Valid range
is 0 to 64. Use 0 to derive autoconfigures based on the
number of cpus with a max of 8

hw.lio.console_bitmask

Bitmask
indicating which consoles have debug output redirected to
syslog.

hw.lio.rss

To
enable/disable driver RSS support

hw.lio.hwlro
