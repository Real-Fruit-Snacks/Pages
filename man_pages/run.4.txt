DESCRIPTION

The run driver supports
USB 2.0 wireless adapters based on the Ralink RT2700U,
RT2800U, RT3000U and RT3900E chipsets.

The RT2700U
chipset consists of two integrated chips, an RT2770 MAC/BBP
and an RT2720 (1T2R) or RT2750 (dual-band 1T2R) radio
transceiver.

The RT2800U
chipset consists of two integrated chips, an RT2870 MAC/BBP
and an RT2820 (2T3R) or RT2850 (dual-band 2T3R) radio
transceiver.

The RT3000U is a
single-chip solution based on an RT3070 MAC/BBP and an
RT3020 (1T1R), RT3021 (1T2R) or RT3022 (2T2R) single-band
radio transceiver.

The RT3900E is a
single-chip USB 2.0 802.11n solution. The MAC/Baseband
Processor can be an RT3593, RT5390, RT5392 or an RT5592. The
radio can be an RT3053, RT5370, RT5372 or an RT5572. The
RT3053 chip operates in the 2GHz and 5GHz spectra and
supports up to 3 transmit paths and 3 receiver paths (3T3R).
The RT5370 chip operates in the 2GHz spectrum and supports 1
transmit path and 1 receiver path (1T1R). The RT5372 chip
operates in the 2GHz spectrum and supports up to 2 transmit
paths and 2 receiver paths (2T2R). The RT5572 chip operates
in the 2GHz and 5GHz spectra and supports up to 2 transmit
paths and 2 receiver paths (2T2R).

These are the
modes the run driver can operate in:

BSS mode

Also known as
infrastructure mode, this is used when associating
with an access point, through which all traffic passes. This
mode is the default.

Host AP mode

In this mode
the driver acts as an access point (base station) for other
cards.

monitor mode

In this mode
the driver is able to receive packets without associating
with an access point. This disables the internal receive
filter and enables the card to capture packets from networks
which it wouldn&rsquo;t normally have access to, or to scan
for access points.

The run
driver can be configured to use Wired Equivalent Privacy
(WEP) or Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA-PSK and WPA2-PSK). WPA
is the de facto encryption standard for wireless networks.
It is strongly recommended that WEP not be used as the sole
mechanism to secure wireless communication, due to serious
weaknesses in it. The run driver offloads both
encryption and decryption of data frames to the hardware for
the WEP40, WEP104, TKIP(+MIC) and CCMP ciphers.

The run
driver can be configured at runtime with ifconfig(8).

EXAMPLES

Join an existing BSS network
(i.e., connect to an access point):

ifconfig wlan
create wlandev run0 inet 192.168.0.20 \ 
netmask 0xffffff00

Join a specific
BSS network with network name
&rsquo;&rsquo;my_net&rsquo;&rsquo;:

ifconfig wlan
create wlandev run0 ssid my_net up

Join a specific
BSS network with 64-bit WEP encryption:

ifconfig wlan
create wlandev run0 ssid my_net \

wepmode on wepkey 0x1234567890 weptxkey 1 up

Join a specific
BSS network with 128-bit WEP encryption:

ifconfig wlan
create wlandev run0 wlanmode adhoc ssid my_net \ 
wepmode on wepkey 0x01020304050607080910111213 weptxkey
1

DIAGNOSTICS

run%d: faild load firmware of
file runfw  For some reason, the driver was unable
to read the microcode file from the filesystem. The file
might be missing or corrupted.

run%d: could
not load 8051 microcode  An error occurred while
attempting to upload the microcode to the onboard 8051
microcontroller unit.

run%d: device
timeout  A frame dispatched to the hardware for
transmission did not complete in time. The driver will reset
the hardware. This should not happen.
