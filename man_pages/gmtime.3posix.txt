GMTIME(3POSIX)             POSIX Programmer's Manual            GMTIME(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       gmtime, gmtime_r — convert a time value to a broken-down UTC time

SYNOPSIS
       #include <time.h>

       struct tm *gmtime(const time_t *timer);
       struct tm *gmtime_r(const time_t *restrict timer,
           struct tm *restrict result);

DESCRIPTION
       For gmtime(): The functionality described on  this  reference  page  is
       aligned  with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements
       described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume  of
       POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The gmtime() function shall convert the time in seconds since the Epoch
       pointed to by timer into a broken-down time, expressed  as  Coordinated
       Universal Time (UTC).

       The  relationship  between a time in seconds since the Epoch used as an
       argument to gmtime() and the tm  structure  (defined  in  the  <time.h>
       header)  is  that  the  result  shall be as specified in the expression
       given in the definition of seconds since the Epoch (see the Base  Defi‐
       nitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 4.16, Seconds Since the Epoch),
       where the names in the structure and in the expression correspond.

       The same relationship shall apply for gmtime_r().

       The gmtime() function need not be thread-safe.

       The asctime(), ctime(), gmtime(), and localtime() functions  shall  re‐
       turn  values in one of two static objects: a broken-down time structure
       and an array of type char.  Execution of any of the functions may over‐
       write the information returned in either of these objects by any of the
       other functions.

       The gmtime_r() function shall convert the time  in  seconds  since  the
       Epoch  pointed to by timer into a broken-down time expressed as Coordi‐
       nated Universal Time (UTC).  The broken-down  time  is  stored  in  the
       structure  referred  to  by result.  The gmtime_r() function shall also
       return the address of the same structure.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful  completion,  the  gmtime()  function  shall  return  a
       pointer to a struct tm.  If an error is detected, gmtime() shall return
       a null pointer and set errno to indicate the error.

       Upon successful completion, gmtime_r() shall return the address of  the
       structure  pointed to by the argument result.  If an error is detected,
       gmtime_r() shall return a null pointer and set errno  to  indicate  the
       error.

ERRORS
       The gmtime() and gmtime_r() functions shall fail if:

       EOVERFLOW
              The result cannot be represented.

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       The  gmtime_r()  function  is thread-safe and returns values in a user-
       supplied buffer instead of possibly using a static data area  that  may
       be overwritten by each call.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
