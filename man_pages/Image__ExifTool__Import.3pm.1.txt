NAME
       Image::ExifTool::Import - Import CSV and JSON database files

SYNOPSIS
           use Image::ExifTool::Import qw(ReadCSV ReadJSON);

           $err = ReadCSV($csvFile, \%database);

           $err = ReadJSON($jsonfile, \%database);

DESCRIPTION
       This module contains routines for importing tag information from CSV
       (Comma Separated Value) and JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) database
       files.

EXPORTS
       Exports nothing by default, but ReadCSV and ReadJSON may be exported.

METHODS
   ReadCSV / ReadJSON
       Read CSV or JSON file into a database hash.

       Inputs:
           0) CSV file name or file reference.

           1) Hash reference for database object.

           2) Optional string used to represent an undefined (missing) tag
           value.  (Used for deleting tags.)

           3) For ReadCSV this gives the delimiter for CSV entries, with a
           default of ",".  For ReadJSON this is the character set for
           converting Unicode escape sequences in strings, with a default of
           "UTF8".  See the ExifTool Charset option for a list of valid
           character sets.

       Return Value:
           These functions return an error string, or undef on success and
           populate the database hash with entries from the CSV or JSON file.
           Entries are keyed based on the SourceFile column of the CSV or JSON
           information, and are stored as hash lookups of tag name/value for
           each SourceFile.
