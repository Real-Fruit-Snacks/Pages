NAME

sqlr-stop
&minus; kill running SQLRelay daemons

SYNOPSIS

sqlr-stop
[&minus;id ID]

DESCRIPTION

sqlr-stop
program is provided to simplify the stop process.

The sqlr-stop
command is provided to kill running daemons. It accepts a
single argument, the id of the instance to kill. Running it
kills anything with "sqlr-" and that id in
it&rsquo;s name. It uses grep, so it&rsquo;s not perfect. If
you have id&rsquo;s like "web" and
"webster" and run "sqlr-stop web" then
it will kill both of them. Running it with no arguments will
kill all SQL Relay processes.
