SCSPD(8) BSD System Manager&rsquo;s Manual SCSPD(8)

NAME

scspd &mdash; SCSP
daemon

SYNOPSIS

scspd
[&minus;f &lang; cfg&minus;file&rang; ]
[&minus;d] [&minus;T&lang;
options&rang; ]

DESCRIPTION

The scspd utility is an
implementation of the Server Cache Synchronization Protocol
(SCSP) for the Host ATM Research Platform (HARP) networking
software. The scspd utility synchronizes the cache(s)
of server(s) running on a host with the caches of servers on
remote hosts. SCSP is defined for a number of different
protocols, but the present version of scspd only
supports ATMARP.

By using
scspd and atmarpd(8), one can provide multiple ATMARP
servers in a single ATM LIS. This might be useful, for
example, when a LIS consists of a number of local-area ATM
networks connected by long-distance links. Each local-area
network could have its own ATMARP server, with all the
servers&rsquo; caches being synchronized by SCSP. Then, if a
long-distance link fails, hosts on a local-area network will
still have connectivity to other local hosts (since they all
use the local ATMARP server); when the long-distance link is
restored, SCSP will re-synchronize the servers&rsquo;
caches, restoring connectivity to remote hosts. Both
scspd and atmarpd(8) must be running before any
ATMARP cache synchronization can take place.

The scspd
utility implements SCSP as specified in RFC 2334, Server
Cache Synchronization Protocol (SCSP) and
draft&minus;ietf&minus;ion&minus;scspd&minus;atmarpd&minus;00.txt,
A Distributed ATMARP Service using SCSP.

When
scspd starts, it parses its command line and puts
itself into the background.

TERMINOLOGY

Some of the vocabulary
associated with SCSP can be confusing. In this document, the
following definitions are used:

Client
server or local server means the server running
on the same host as scspd whose cache is to be
synchronized with that of one or more remote servers. When
the word server is used alone, it means client
server.

Remote
server means a server running on some host other than
the one where scspd is running.

Directly
Connected Server (DCS) means a remote server that
scspd communicates with directly. The remote server
will also be running an implementation of SCSP.

Cache
Alignment (CA) has two meanings. The Cache Alignment
protocol is a part of the SCSP protocol specification, and
the Cache Alignment finite state machine (FSM) is a finite
state machine that implements the Cache Alignment
protocol.

OPTIONS

The command-line options
are:

&minus;f &lang;
cfg&minus;file&rang;

Specifies the name of the
configuration file. If this option is not specified,
scspd looks for the file /etc/scspd.conf.

&minus;d

Specifies that
scspd is to be run in debug mode. In debug mode, the
daemon is not put into the background. Log messages are
written to standard output instead of to the log file
specified in the configuration file.

&minus;T&lang;
options&rang;

Specifies that
scspd will trace specified events and messages as it
executes. The &minus;T flag is followed by one or
more of the following options:

c

trace
scspd&rsquo;s CA Finite State Machine (FSM),

h

trace
scspd&rsquo;s Hello FSM,

i

trace
scspd&rsquo;s Client Interface FSM,

C

trace CA, CSUS,
CSU Request, and CSU Reply messages,

H

trace Hello
messages,

I

trace interface
messages to and from scspd&rsquo;s clients.

CONFIGURATION

The configuration file consists
of a sequence of configuration statements. These statements
specify information about the servers, both local and
remote, whose caches are to be synchronized by scspd.
RFC 2334, Server Cache Synchronization Protocol
(SCSP) and
draft&minus;ietf&minus;ion&minus;scspd&minus;atmarpd&minus;00.txt,
A Distributed ATMARP Service using SCSP will be
valuable in understanding how to configure scspd.

A configuration
statement other than a comment is terminated by a semicolon.
Some statements contain blocks, delimited by braces
(&rsquo;&rsquo;{&rsquo;&rsquo; and
&rsquo;&rsquo;}&rsquo;&rsquo;). Configuration statement
keywords are not case-sensitive, but some parameters (e.g.
interface names) are. Configuration statements can span
multiple lines.

Comments

Three types of comments are allowed:

# comments:

any characters from
&rsquo;&rsquo;#&rsquo;&rsquo; to the end of the line are
ignored.

C comments:

any characters between
&rsquo;&rsquo;/*&rsquo;&rsquo; and
&rsquo;&rsquo;*/&rsquo;&rsquo; are ignored.

C++ comments:

any characters from
&rsquo;&rsquo;//&rsquo;&rsquo; to the end of the line are
ignored.

Statements

The configuration statements recognized by scspd
are:

Server
 {

Protocol ;

Netif ;

ServerGroupID ;

FamilyID ;

DCS {

ATMaddr ;

ID ;

CAReXmitInt ;

CSUSReXmitInt ;

CSUReXmitInt ;

CSUReXmitMax ;

HelloDead ;

HelloInt ;

Hops ;

};

};

Log {

File ;

Syslog;

};

Where a host
address needs to be specified in the configuration file,
either a DNS name or an IP address in dotted decimal format
can be used.

ATM addresses
are specified as strings of hex digits, with an optional
leading &rsquo;&rsquo;0x&rsquo;&rsquo;. Fields within the
address may be separated by periods, but periods are for
readability only and are ignored. ATM addresses are 20 bytes
long. The full address, including any leading zeroes, must
be given. For example:

0x47.0005.80.ffe100.0000.f21a.0170.0020481a0170.00

Server
Statement 
The server statement specifies a client server whose
cache to be synchronized with the caches of other servers
running on remote hosts. There will be one server
statement in the configuration file for each client server
whose cache is to be synchronized by scspd. The
format of the server statement is:

Server
&lang; name&rang; { &lang; statements&rang;
};

A name
must be specified on the server statement, but it is
not used by scspd. It is expected to give a brief
description of the server&rsquo;s purpose.

The
server statement has several sub-statements that
specify the details of the scspd&rsquo;s
configuration. They are:

Protocol ATMARP;

The only protocol supported by
the current version of scspd is ATMARP. The
protocol statement must always be specified.

Netif &lang;
intf&rang; ;

The netif statement
specifies the name of the ATM network interface on which a
client server is providing service. The netif
statement must always be specified.

ServerGroupID &lang;
ID&rang; ;

The ServerGroupID
statement specifies an identifier for the group of servers
being synchronized by scspd. The ID is
specified as a decimal number in the range 0 - 65,535. The
server group ID must be the same for all servers whose
caches are being synchronized by an SCSP session. That is,
the server group ID for a host must be the same for all
Directly Connected Servers (DCSs) pointed to within a
server statement. The ServerGroupID statement
must always be specified.

FamilyID &lang;
ID&rang; ;

The familyID statement
specifies an identifier for a family of parallel SCSP
sessions running between a group of hosts (i.e., a set of
SCSP sessions with different protocol IDs but the same set
of servers). The ID is specified as a decimal number
in the range 0 - 65,535. The family ID is currently not used
by scspd.

DCS
Statement 
The DCS statement is a sub-statement of the
server statement that specifies the characteristics
of a Directly Connected Server (DCS). The server
statement will have one DCS statement for each DCS
that scspd is to exchange information with. The
DCS statement has a number of sub-statements that
specify the details of the configuration for the DCS. They
are:

ATMaddr &lang;
ATM address&rang; ;

The ATMaddr statement
specifies the ATM address of the DCS. The ATMaddr
statement must always be specified.

ID &lang;
host&rang; ;

The ID statement
specifies the SCSP identifier of the DCS. For ATMARP, the ID
is the IP address or DNS name associated with the ATM
interface of the DCS. The ID statement must always be
specified.

CAReXmitInt &lang;
int&rang; ;

The CAReXmitInt
statement specifies the interval that is allowed to elapse
between retransmissions of CA messages. If a CA message is
sent and an acknowledgement is not received within
CAReXmitInt seconds, the message will be
retransmitted. The default value for CAReXmitInt is 3
seconds.

CSUSReXmitInt &lang;
int&rang; ;

The CSUSReXmitInt
statement specifies the interval that is allowed to elapse
between retransmissions of CSU Solicit messages. When a CSUS
message is sent, any Cache State Advertisements (CSAs)
requested by the CSUS that have not been received within
CSUSReXmitInt seconds will be requested again by
another CSUS message. The default value for
CSUSReXmitInt is 3 seconds. Be careful not to confuse
CSUSReXmitInt and CSUReXmitInt.

CSUReXmitInt &lang;
int&rang; ;

The CSUReXmitInt
statement specifies the interval that is allowed to elapse
between retransmissions of CSU Request messages. When a CSU
Request message is sent, any CSAs that are not acknowledged
by a CSU Reply message within CSUReXmitInt seconds
will be retransmitted. The default value for
CSUReXmitInt is 2 seconds. Be careful not to confuse
CSUReXmitInt and CSUSReXmitInt.

CSUReXmitMax &lang;
cnt&rang; ;

The CSUReXmitMax
statement specifies the number of times that a CSA will be
retransmitted as described above before SCSP gives up on the
CSA and discards it. The default value for
CSUReXmitMax is 5.

HelloDead &lang;
cnt&rang; ;

The HelloDead statement
specifies the Hello Dead Factor that will be sent to the DCS
in Hello messages. A &rsquo;&rsquo;DCS down&rsquo;&rsquo;
condition will be detected when nothing is received from a
DCS in HelloDead * HelloInt seconds. The
default value for HelloDead is 3.

HelloInt &lang;
int&rang; ;

The HelloInt statement
specifies the Hello Interval that will be sent to the DCS in
Hello messages. The default value for HelloInt is 3
seconds.

Hops &lang;
cnt&rang; ;

The Hops statement
specifies the number of hops (DCS to DCS) that will be
specified in CSAs originating from the local server. This
number must be at least as large as the diameter of the
server group. That is, it must be large enough for a CSA to
be propagated from server to server all the way across the
server group. The default value for Hops is 3.

Log
Statement 
The log statement specifies how scspd is to
log information about its operation. The scspd
utility can write log information to a file, to the system
log, or both.

File &lang;
file name&rang; ;

The file statement
specifies that scspd is to write its log messages to
the named file. Log messages will be appended to the end of
the file if it already exists.

Syslog;

The syslog statement
specifies that scspd is to write its log messages to
the syslog facility. The scspd utility writes its
messages to syslog with a facility code of LOG_DAEMON.

If no log
statement is specified, scspd writes log messages to
the system log. If both file and syslog are
specified, scspd will write log messages to both the
named file and the system log.

Examples

An example of a simple configuration file for scspd
might be:

server
atmarp_ni0 { 
protocol ATMARP; 
netif ni0; 
ServerGroupID 23; 
DCS { 
ID 10.1.1.2; 
ATMaddr 0x47.0005.80.ffdc00.0000.0002.0001.002048061de7.00;

hops 2; 
}; 
};

This
configuration would synchronize the cache of the ATMARP
server operating on network interface ni0 with the cache of
a second server running on a host whose IP address is
10.1.1.2. Log messages would be written to the system
log.

SIGNAL PROCESSING

The following signals can be
used to control scspd:

SIGHUP

Reread the
configuration file and restart scspd.

SIGINT

Dump debugging
information to a file. When it receives a SIGINT signal,
scspd dumps a summary of its control blocks to a text
file (see FILES).

FILES 
/etc/scspd.conf

scspd default
configuration file name. A different file name can be
specified with the &minus;f command-line option.

/tmp/scspd.&lang;
pid&rang; .&lang; seq&rang; .out

debugging information dump file
name. The scspd utility writes a summary of its
control blocks to this file when it receives a SIGINT
signal. &lang; pid&rang; is the process ID of the
daemon and &lang; seq&rang; is a sequence number
which is incremented every time a dump is taken.

/tmp/scspd.&lang;
pid&rang; .trace

trace file. The scspd
utility writes trace information to this file if the
&minus;T option is specified on the command line.

BUGS

If scspd terminates and
is restarted, there will be a period of instability while
previously-synchronized cache entries time out and are
refreshed.
