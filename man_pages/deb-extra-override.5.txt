While most
information about a binary/source package can be found in
the control/.dsc file, all of it can be overridden when
it&rsquo;s exported to Packages/Sources files. The extra
override file contains those overrides.

The extra
override file has a simple whitespace-delimited format.
Comments are allowed (denoted with a #).

mirror.
