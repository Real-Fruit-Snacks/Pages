NAME
       Glib::Signal -  Object customization and general purpose notification

DESCRIPTION
       This page describes some functions related to signals in Glib.  Since
       most things you can do with signals are tied to Glib::Object instances,
       the majority of the signal functions are documented there.

   Thread safety
       Some libraries, most notably GStreamer, sometimes invoke signal
       handlers from a foreign thread that has no Perl interpreter associated
       with it.  When this happens, we have no choice but to hand the
       marshalling over to the main loop which in turn later wakes up the main
       thread and lets it handle the request.  We cannot invoke the signal
       handler from the foreign thread since the Perl interpreter may not be
       used concurrently.

       The downside to this approach is that the foreign thread is blocked
       until the main thread has finished executing the signal handler.  This
       might lead to deadlocks.  It might help in this case to wrap the
       crucial parts of the signal handler inside a Glib::Idle callback so
       that the signal handler can return directly.

METHODS
   integer = Glib->install_exception_handler ($func, $data=undef)
       •   $func (subroutine)

       •   $data (scalar)

       Install a subroutine to be executed when a signal emission traps an
       exception (a croak or die).  $func should return boolean (true if the
       handler should remain installed) and expect to receive a single scalar.
       This scalar will be a private copy of $@ which the handler can mangle
       to its heart's content.

       Returns an identifier that may be used with "remove_exception_handler".

       See "gperl_install_exception_handler()" in Glib::xsapi.

   Glib->remove_exception_handler ($tag)
       •   $tag (integer)

       Remove the exception handler identified by $tag, as returned by
       "install_exception_handler".  If $tag cannot be found, this does
       nothing.

       WARNING:  Do not call this function from within an exception handler.
       If you want to remove your handler during its execution just have it
       return false.

       See "gperl_remove_exception_handler()" in Glib::xsapi.
