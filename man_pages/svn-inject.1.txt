NAME

svn-inject
− puts a Debian source package into Subversion
repository

SYNOPSIS

svn−inject
[options] 

package.dsc

repository_URL

OPTIONS

svn−inject
accepts the following options on the command−line:

−h

print the help menu

−v

Make the command output
verbose

Default:
Off.

−q

Hide less important
messages

Default:
Off.

−l

Layout type. 1 (default) means
package/{trunk,tags,branches,...} scheme, 2 means the
{trunk,tags,branches,...}/package scheme.

Default: 1

−t
directory

Specify the directory where the
.orig.tar.gz files are stored on the local machine.

Default:
Off.

−d
| −−do−like=directory

Looks at the working directory
of some other package and uses its base URL, tarball storage
directory and similar checkout target directory.

Default:
Off.

−c
number

Checkout nothing (0), trunk
directory (1) or everything (2) when the work is done.

Default: 1

−o

Only keep modified files under
SVN control (including the debian/ directory), track only
parts of upstream branch

Default:
Off.

−O
| −−no−branches

Do not create the branches
subdirectory at all. This works in a similar way to
−o but all changes on upstream files (e.g. meta
changes like updating the config.guess and config.sub files)
are ignored and the upstream branch is not used.

Default: use
branches/.

−s

By default,
svn−inject used to create .svn/deb−layout
after an inject operation if a checkout followed the inject.
Since version 0.6.22 this behaviour is deprecated.

With this
parameter svn−inject will replicate the old
behaviour.

This option was
provided since it can be useful when creating a local
override file.

Default:
Off.

−setprops
−set−props

Set svn−bp:* props on the
debian directory automatically.

Default:
Off.
