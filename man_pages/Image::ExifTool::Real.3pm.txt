Image::ExifTool::Real(User Contributed Perl DocumentImage::ExifTool::Real(3pm)

NAME
       Image::ExifTool::Real - Read Real audio/video meta information

SYNOPSIS
       This module is used by Image::ExifTool

DESCRIPTION
       This module contains the routines required by Image::ExifTool to read
       meta information in RealAudio (RA), RealMedia (RM, RV and RMVB) and
       RealMedia Metafile (RAM and RPM) files.

NOTES
       There must be a bug in the software that wrote the Metadata used in the
       test file t/images/Real.rm because the TrackLyricsDataSize word is
       written little-endian, but the Real format is big-endian.
