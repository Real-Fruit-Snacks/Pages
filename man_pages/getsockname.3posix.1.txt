GETSOCKNAME(3POSIX)        POSIX Programmer's Manual       GETSOCKNAME(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       getsockname — get the socket name

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/socket.h>

       int getsockname(int socket, struct sockaddr *restrict address,
           socklen_t *restrict address_len);

DESCRIPTION
       The getsockname() function shall retrieve the locally-bound name of the
       specified  socket, store this address in the sockaddr structure pointed
       to by the address argument, and store the length of this address in the
       object pointed to by the address_len argument.

       The  address_len  argument  points to a socklen_t object which on input
       specifies the length of the supplied sockaddr structure, and on  output
       specifies  the  length  of the stored address.  If the actual length of
       the address is greater than the length of the supplied sockaddr  struc‐
       ture, the stored address shall be truncated.

       If  the  socket has not been bound to a local name, the value stored in
       the object pointed to by address is unspecified.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, 0 shall be returned, the  address  argument
       shall  point to the address of the socket, and the address_len argument
       shall point to the length of the address. Otherwise, -1  shall  be  re‐
       turned and errno set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The getsockname() function shall fail if:

       EBADF  The socket argument is not a valid file descriptor.

       ENOTSOCK
              The socket argument does not refer to a socket.

       EOPNOTSUPP
              The operation is not supported for this socket's protocol.

       The getsockname() function may fail if:

       EINVAL The socket has been shut down.

       ENOBUFS
              Insufficient  resources were available in the system to complete
              the function.
