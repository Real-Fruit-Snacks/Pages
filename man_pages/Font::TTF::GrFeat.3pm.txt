NAME
       Font::TTF::GrFeat - Graphite Font Features

DESCRIPTION
INSTANCE VARIABLES
       version
       features
           An array of hashes of the following form

           feature feature id number

           name    name index in name table

           exclusive
                   exclusive flag

           default the default setting number

           settings
                   hash of setting number against name string index

METHODS
   $t->read
       Reads the features from the TTF file into memory

   $t->out($fh)
       Writes the features to a TTF file

   $t->minsize()
       Returns the minimum size this table can be. If it is smaller than this,
       then the table must be bad and should be deleted or whatever.

   $t->print($fh)
       Prints a human-readable representation of the table

   $t->tag_to_num ($feat_str)
       Convert an alphanumeric feature id tag (string) to a number (32-bit).
       Tags are normally 4 chars. Graphite ignores space padding if it is
       present, so we do the same here.

   $t->num_to_tag ($feat_num)
       Convert a feature id number (32-bit) back to a tag (string).  Trailing
       space or null padding is removed.  Feature id numbers that do not
       represent alphanumeric tags are returned unchanged.

BUGS
       The version 1 Feat table ends with a feature (id 1) named NoName with
       zero settings but with an offset to the last entry in the setting
       array. This last setting has id 0 and an invalid name id. This last
       feature is changed to have one setting.
