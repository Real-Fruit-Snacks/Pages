PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       unlockpt — unlock a pseudo-terminal master/slave pair

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdlib.h>

       int unlockpt(int fildes);

DESCRIPTION
       The unlockpt() function shall unlock the slave  pseudo-terminal  device
       associated with the master to which fildes refers.

       Conforming  applications  shall ensure that they call unlockpt() before
       opening the slave side of a pseudo-terminal device.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, unlockpt() shall return  0.  Otherwise,  it
       shall return -1 and set errno to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The unlockpt() function may fail if:

       EBADF  The fildes argument is not a file descriptor open for writing.

       EINVAL The  fildes argument is not associated with a master pseudo-ter‐
              minal device.
