DESCRIPTION

The vga driver is a
generic video card driver which provides access to video
cards. This driver is required for the console driver
syscons(4). The console driver will call the vga
driver to manipulate video hardware (changing video modes,
loading font, etc).

The vga
driver supports the standard video cards: MDA, CGA, EGA and
VGA. In addition, the driver can utilize VESA BIOS
extensions if the video card supports them. VESA support can
either be statically included in the kernel or can be loaded
as a separate module.

In order to
statically link the VESA support to the kernel, the VESA
option (see below) must be defined in the kernel
configuration file.

The vesa
module can be dynamically loaded into the kernel using
kldload(8).

DRIVER CONFIGURATION

Kernel Configuration
Options 
The following kernel configuration options (see config(8))
can be used to control the vga driver. These options
provide compatibility with certain VGA cards.

VGA_ALT_SEQACCESS

You may want to try this option
if the mouse pointer is not drawn correctly or the font does
not seem to be loaded properly on the VGA card. However, it
may cause flicker on some systems.

VGA_SLOW_IOACCESS

Older VGA cards may require
this option for proper operation. It makes the driver
perform byte-wide I/O to VGA registers and slow down a
little.

VGA_WIDTH90

This option enables 90 column
modes: 90x25, 90x30, 90x43, 90x50, 90x60. These modes are
not always supported by the video card and the display. It
is highly likely that LCD display cannot work with these
modes.

The following
options add optional features to the driver.

VESA

Add VESA BIOS
support to the driver. If the VGA card has the VESA BIOS
extension 1.2 or later, this option will utilize the VESA
BIOS service to switch to high resolution modes.

VESA_DEBUG=N

Set the VESA support debug
level to N. The default value is zero, which
suppresses all debugging output.

The following
options will remove some features from the vga driver
and save kernel memory.

VGA_NO_FONT_LOADING

The vga driver can load
software font to EGA and VGA cards. This option removes this
feature. Note that if you use this option and still wish to
use the mouse on the console then you must also use the
SC_ALT_MOUSE_IMAGE option. See syscons(4).

VGA_NO_MODE_CHANGE

This option prevents the driver
from changing video modes.

EXAMPLES

Your kernel configuration should
normally have:

device vga

And you need the
following line in /boot/device.hints.

hint.vga.0.at="isa"

The following
lines should be included in the kernel configuration file in
order to enable the VESA BIOS Extension support.

options VESA

device vga

If you do not
want VESA support included in the kernel, but want to use
occasionally, do not add the VESA option. And load the
vesa module as desired:

kldload
vesa
