NAME
       bmptoppm - replaced by bmptopnm

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       bmptoppm was replaced in Netpbm 9.25 (March 2002) by bmptopnm(1).

       bmptopnm  is backward compatible with bmptoppm except that it generates
       PBM and PGM output when it is more appropriate than PPM.
