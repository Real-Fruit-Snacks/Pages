NAME

bmptopnm -
convert a BMP file into a PBM, PGM, or PNM image

SYNOPSIS

bmptopnm

[-verbose]

[bmpfile]

DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

bmptopnm
reads a Microsoft Windows or OS/2 BMP file as input. and
produces a PBM, PGM, or PNM image as output. If the input is
colormapped and contains only black and white, the output is
PBM. If the input is colormapped and contains only black
white and gray, the output is PGM. Otherwise, the output is
PPM.

bmptopnm
understands BMP files compressed with run length encoding
(RLE4/RLE8), but not if that encoding includes a
"delta" (which is rare). bmptopnm
recognizes the delta and issues an error message.

Before Netpbm
10.75 (June 2016), bmptopnm could not convert Version
4 or Version 5 Windows BMP images.

bmptopnm
cannot convert BMP files compressed with JPEG or PNG
encoding. It recognizes the compression and issues an error
message. Before Netpbm 10.32 (February 2006),
bmptopnm couldn’t convert RLE8 BMP files
either, and before Netpbm 10.85 (December 2018), it
couldn’t convert RLE4 (between 10.32 and 10.85, it
would act like it recognized the format, but produce garbage
output).

Before Netpbm
10.18 (September 2003), this program could not convert BMP
images with the BI_BITFIELDS format ("compression
type"). It would recognize the format and issue an
error message.

bmptopnm
cannot convert OS/2 BMP files with 16 bits per pixel (only
because the author did not have a complete specification for
them). It recognizes the format and issues an error message.
Before Netpbm 10.16 (June 2003), it also could not convert
Windows BMP files with 16 bits per pixel.

OPTIONS

In addition to
the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most
notably -quiet, see
 Common Options ),
bmptopnm recognizes the following command line
option: 
-verbose

Report contents of the BMP
header to the standard error.
