NAME

unroff -
convert troff documents to plain text

SYNTAX

unroff [
-E ] [ -J ] [ -8 ] [ -mxx
] [ file ... ]

DESCRIPTION

unroff
processes documents written to be formatted with
troff (or nroff, or any of the other
*roff variants) and converts them to plain text. This
is similar to what deroff does, but the result is
sometimes better than deroff output.

Optional flags
may be given to modify the operation of unroff, as
follows:

-E

Echo input tokens as they are read. Useful mainly for
debugging. 

-J

Join output lines that would be part of a single
paragraph so they form a single output line. This is useful
if you plan to move the resulting output into a document
formatter that treats paragraphs as a single line. The
default is to do line wrapping according to the line length
specified in the input document.

-8

Write 8-bit ISO Latin-1 (ISO 8859-1) characters. This
option may be useful for producing output intended to be
viewed on devices capable of 8-bit character display.
Without this option, 8-bit Latin-1 characters will generall
appear in the output as ’’[[name]]’’
where ’’name’’ is the
troffcvt internal name for the character, e.g.,
’’[[Aacute]]’’. For some of these
characters, an ASCII approximation will be used if something
reasonably close is available.

-mxx

Specify macro package, usually -man, -me,
-mm, or -ms.

DIAGNOSTICS

line length
clipped to nnn chars. A very long line length was
requested, so long that it would likely result in output
line assembly buffer overflow. The length is clipped to
prevent this.

output
buffer capacity exceeded. This means some line is so
long that it couldn’t be collected in the output line
assembly buffer. Most likely this signals a bug in
tc2text, since the length is supposed to be kept
within reasonable bounds (see previous paragraph).

BUGS

unroff
doesn’t do so well with tables, particularly tables
with multiple-line cells. Table centering isn’t
handled.
