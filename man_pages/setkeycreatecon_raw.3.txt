getkeycreatecon(3)         SELinux API documentation        getkeycreatecon(3)

NAME
       getkeycreatecon, setkeycreatecon - get or set the SELinux security con-
       text used for creating a new kernel keyrings

SYNOPSIS
       #include <selinux/selinux.h>

       int getkeycreatecon(char **con);

       int getkeycreatecon_raw(char **con);

       int setkeycreatecon(char *context);

       int setkeycreatecon_raw(char *context);

DESCRIPTION
       getkeycreatecon() retrieves the context used for creating a new  kernel
       keyring.  This returned context should be freed with freecon(3) if non-
       NULL.  getkeycreatecon() sets *con to NULL if no keycreate context  has
       been  explicitly  set by the program (i.e. using the default policy be-
       havior).

       setkeycreatecon() sets the context  used  for  creating  a  new  kernel
       keyring.   NULL  can be passed to setkeycreatecon() to reset to the de-
       fault policy behavior.  The keycreate context  is  automatically  reset
       after the next execve(2), so a program doesn't need to explicitly sani-
       tize it upon startup.

       setkeycreatecon() can be applied prior to library functions that inter-
       nally  perform an file creation, in order to set an file context on the
       objects.

       getkeycreatecon_raw() and setkeycreatecon_raw() behave  identically  to
       their non-raw counterparts but do not perform context translation.

       Note:  Signal  handlers that perform a setkeycreatecon() must take care
       to save, reset, and restore the keycreate context to  avoid  unexpected
       behavior.

       Note: Contexts are thread specific.

RETURN VALUE
       On error -1 is returned.  On success 0 is returned.
