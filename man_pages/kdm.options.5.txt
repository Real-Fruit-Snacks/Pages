NAME

kdm.options
&minus; configuration options for X display manager

DESCRIPTION

/etc/kde3/kdm/kdm.options
contains a set of flags that determine some of the behavior
of the X display manager kdm(1).

/etc/kde3/kdm/kdm.options
may contain comments, which begin with a hash mark and end
at the next newline, just like comments in shell scripts.
The rest of the file consists of options which are expressed
as words separated by hyphens, with only one option per
line. If an option is present with the
&rsquo;no&minus;&rsquo; prefix, or absent, it is disabled,
otherwise it is considered enabled.

Available
options are: 
ignore&minus;nologin

Normally, the contents of the
/etc/nologin file will be displayed using
xmessage(1x) (if xmessage is available), and
the user will be returned to the kdm login screen after the
xmessage is dismissed. If this option is enabled, kdm starts
a session as usual (after the xmessage is dismissed, if
xmessage is available).

restart&minus;on&minus;upgrade

Enable this option with caution
on &rsquo;production&rsquo; machines; it causes the kdm
daemon to be stopped and restarted on upgrade, even if the
process has children (which means it is managing X
sessions). Typically when a package that contains a daemon
is being installed or upgraded, its maintainer scripts stop
a running daemon process before installing the new binary,
and restart it after the new binary is installed. Stopping
kdm causes immediate termination of any sessions it manages;
in some situations this could be an unwelcome surprise (for
instance, for remote kdm users who had no idea the
administrator was performing system maintenance). On the
other hand, for machines that stay up for long periods of
time, leaving the old daemon running can be a bad idea if
the new version has, for instance, a fix for a security
vulnerability (overwriting kdm&rsquo;s executable on the
file system has no effect on the copy of kdm in memory). The
kdm pre&minus;removal script checks to see if the kdm
process has any children; if it does, it is possible that
someone&rsquo;s session would be killed by stopping kdm, so
a warning is issued and an opportunity to abort the upgrade
of kdm is provided. If this option is disabled (the Debian
default), kdm will be not be stopped or started during an
install or upgrade; the administrator will have to do so by
hand (with &rsquo;/etc/init.d/kdm restart&rsquo;, or by
rebooting the system) before the newly installed kdm binary
is used.

use&minus;sessreg

If this option is enabled (the
Debian default), the sessreg program will be invoked to
register X sessions managed by kdm in the utmp and wtmp
files. Otherwise, it is not, and the utmp and wtmp files
will have no record of kdm sessions.

Users of older
versions of the Debian system should note that the
&rsquo;run&minus;xconsole&rsquo; option has been removed.
Shell scripts named /etc/kde3/kdm/Xsetup and
/etc/kde3/kdm/Xreset can be edited to disable or
modify the running of xconsole on the kdm greeter screen;
see the kdm manual page for more information.
