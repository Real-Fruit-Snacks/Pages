NAME
       samba-dcerpcd - This is one of Samba's DCERPC server processes that can
       listen on sockets where RPC services are offered and is the parent
       process of the DCERPC services it invokes. Unless separately invoked it
       is started on demand from smbd or winbind and serves DCERPC only over
       named pipes (np) as a helper process. This will be the standard setup
       for most installations (standalone/member server/AD server) unless they
       modify their startup scripts. Note in when Samba is configured as an
       Active Directory Domain controller the samba process that invokes smbd
       will still provide its normal DCERPC services, not samba-dcerpcd. When
       separately invoked by system startup scripts or a daemon, the global
       smb.conf option rpc start on demand helpers = false MUST be set to
       allow samba-dcerpcd to start standalone.

SYNOPSIS
       samba-dcerpcd [-D|--daemon] [-i|--interactive] [-F|--foreground]
        [--no-process-group] [-d <debug level>] [--debug-stdout]
        [--configfile=<configuration file>] [--option=<name>=<value>]
        [--leak-report] [--leak-report-full] [-V|--version] [--libexec-rpcds]
        [--np-helper] [--ready-signal-fd=<fd>] [<SERVICE_1>] [<SERVICE_2>]
        [<...>]

DESCRIPTION
       This tool is part of the samba(7) suite.

       samba-dcerpcd can be used in two ways. In the normal case without
       startup script modification and the global smb.conf option rpc start on
       demand helpers = true is set (the default setting), it is invoked on
       demand from smbd or winbind with a command line containing --np-helper
       to serve DCERPC over named pipes (np). It can also be used in a
       standalone mode where it is started separately from smbd or winbind via
       system startup scripts. If invoked as a standalone daemon or started
       from system startup scripts the global smb.conf option rpc start on
       demand helpers = false MUST be set to false. If the global smb.conf
       option rpc start on demand helpers = true is set to true or left as
       default, samba-dcerpcd will fail to start and log an error message.

       Note that when Samba is run in the Active Directory Domain Controller
       mode the samba AD code will still provide its normal DCERPC services
       whilst allowing samba-dcerpcd to provide services like SRVSVC in the
       same way that smbd used to in this configuration.

       The standalone mode can also be useful for use outside of the Samba
       framework, for example, use with the Linux kernel SMB2 server ksmbd or
       possibly other SMB2 server implementations. In this mode it behaves
       like inetd and listens on sockets on behalf of RPC server
       implementations.

       When a client connects, samba-dcerpcd will start the relevant RPC
       service binary on demand and hand over the connection to that service.
       When an RPC service has been idle for a while, samba-dcerpcd will ask
       it to shut down again.

OPTIONS
       -D|--daemon
           If specified, this parameter causes the server to operate as a
           daemon. That is, it detaches itself and runs in the background,
           fielding requests on the appropriate port. Operating the server as
           a daemon is useful for running samba-dcerpcd outside of the Samba
           framework. However, it can also be used in this way within Samba
           for member servers if configured to start up via system startup
           scripts. This switch is assumed if samba-dcerpcd is executed on the
           command line of a shell.

       -i|--interactive
           If this parameter is specified it causes the server to run
           "interactively", not as a daemon, even if the server is executed on
           the command line of a shell. Setting this parameter negates the
           implicit daemon mode when run from the command line.  samba-dcerpcd
           will only accept one connection and terminate. It will also log to
           standard output, as if the -S parameter had been given.

       -F|--foreground
           If specified, this parameter causes the main samba-dcerpcd process
           to not daemonize, i.e. double-fork and disassociate with the
           terminal. Child processes are still spawned as normal to service
           each connection request, but the main process does not exit. This
           operation mode is suitable for running samba-dcerpcd under process
           supervisors such as supervise and svscan from Daniel J. Bernstein's
           daemontools package, or the AIX process monitor.

       --no-process-group
           Do not create a new process group for samba-dcerpcd.

       --libexec-rpcds
           Offer RPC services for all daemons in Samba's LIBEXECDIR, all
           programs starting with "rpcd_" are assumed to offer RPC services.
           If you don't use the --libexec-rpcds option, you can explicitly
           list all RPC service helpers explicitly on the command line.

       --np-helper
           Run samba-dcerpcd on demand opening named pipe sockets as helpers
           for smbd or winbind. In order to run in this mode, the global
           smb.conf option rpc start on demand helpers = true must be set to
           true (this is the default setting).

       --ready-signal-fd=<fd>
           Report service readiness via this fd to smbd or winbind. Only for
           internal use.
