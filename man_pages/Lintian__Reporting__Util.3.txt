Lintian::Reporting::Util(3) Debian Package Checker Lintian::Reporting::Util(3)

NAME
       Lintian::Reporting::Util - Lintian utility functions

SYNOPSIS
        use Lintian::Reporting::Util qw(load_state_cache find_backlog);

        my $cache = load_state_cache('path/to/state-dir');
        my @backlog = find_backlog('2.12', $cache);

DESCRIPTION
       This module contains a number of utility subs that are nice to have for
       the reporting framework, but on their own did not warrant their own
       module.

       Most subs are imported only on request.

FUNCTIONS
       load_state_cache(STATE_DIR)
           [Reporting tools only] Load the state cache from STATE_DIR.

       save_state_cache(STATE_DIR, STATE)
           [Reporting tools only] Save the STATE cache to STATE_DIR.

       find_backlog(LINTIAN_VERSION, STATE)
           [Reporting tools only] Given the current lintian version and the
           harness state, return a list of group ids that are part of the
           backlog.  The list is sorted based on what version of Lintian
           processed the package.

           Note the result is by design not deterministic to reduce the risk
           of all large packages being in the same run (e.g. like gcc-5 +
           gcc-5-cross + gcc-6 + gcc-6-cross).
