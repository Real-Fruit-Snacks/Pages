NAME
       Glib::Bytes -  Wrappers for bytes objects in GLib

HIERARCHY
         Glib::Boxed
         +----Glib::Bytes

DESCRIPTION
       In addition to the low-level API documented below, Glib also provides
       stringification overloading so that you can treat any "Glib::Bytes"
       object as a normal Perl string.

METHODS
   bytes = Glib::Bytes->new ($data)
       •   $data (scalar)

       Since: glib 2.32

   integer = $bytes1->compare ($bytes2)
       •   $bytes2 (Glib::Bytes)

       Since: glib 2.32

   scalar = $bytes->get_data
       Since: glib 2.32

   boolean = $bytes1->equal ($bytes2)
       •   $bytes2 (Glib::Bytes)

       Since: glib 2.32

   integer = $bytes->hash
       Since: glib 2.32

   unsigned = $bytes->get_size
       Since: glib 2.32
