pic2fig −
Fig preprocessor for drawing simple pictures

SYNOPSIS

pic2fig
file

DESCRIPTION

Pic2fig
is a Fig(l) preprocessor for drawing simple figures
in Fig code. The basic objects are box, line,
arrow, circle, ellipse, arc and
text.

When
pic2fig is executed, it produces an output file in
the current directory. The name is constructed from the
input file’s name. If the input filename ends with
.pic, then that extension will be replaced by .fig.
Otherwise, .fig is appended to the input filename. If
file does not exist, then pic2fig tries
appending .pic to the name.

The input
language for pic2fig is identical to that for
pic, which is used with dtroff(l), except for
extensions listed below. Things enclosed within .PS and .PE
will be translated by pic2fig to Fig
intermediate code which can be further translated into a
number of graphics description languages. Text not within
.PS and .PE will be passed unaltered to the output file. The
default line thickness of drawings is 8 milli-inches. You
may adjust this using the command:

.ps
n

for n
milli-inches. This command must be given in the first
column. Changing the drawing thickness applies to solid,
dashed, and dotted lines, as well as circles, arcs, and
ellipses.

Normally, the
distance between text is 12 points. If you’re using
larger text to label objects, this should be set to an
appropriate larger value. This can be done using the

.baseline
n

command, where
n is any real value, whose units are in typesetter
points.

The shading
texture may be controlled with the command:

.tx N w1 w2
... wN

where the
wN are 32−bit integers expressed in
hexadecimal. This command must be given in the first
column.

Other input
lines which begin with a period character are passed through
to the output unaltered except for stripping the initial
period character. It is recommended that you not use this
feature unless you really know what you’re doing.

Extensions and
differences: Text in pic2fig can be any arbitrary TeX
text. It is set in restricted horizontal mode.

Boxes, circles,
and ellipses may have two attributes not available in
pic: they may be ’’shaded’’
or ’’white’’. Because of
restrictions in the current Imagen postprocessor, objects
may not be given other attributes (eg,
’’dashed’’ or
’’invis’’) if they are
’’shaded’’ or
’’white’’ for that output device.
Shaded figures are grayed in their interior. White objects
force their interior to be whitened if it was shaded by
another object. Objects are
’’stacked’’ on each other in the
order in which they are defined in the pic2fig input
file. The shading attributes are subject to restrictions of
the capabilities of the output device used.
