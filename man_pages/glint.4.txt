DESCRIPTION

glint is
an Xorg driver for 3Dlabs & Texas Instruments
GLINT/Permedia based video cards. The driver is rather fully
accelerated, and provides support for the following
framebuffer depths: 8, 15 (may give bad results with FBDev
support), 16, 24 (32 bpp recommended, 24 bpp has problems),
30, and an 8+24 overlay mode.

SUPPORTED HARDWARE

The
glint driver supports 3Dlabs (GLINT MX, GLINT 500TX,
GLINT 300SX, GLINT GAMMA, GLINT DELTA, GLINT GAMMA2,
Permedia, Permedia 2, Permedia 2v, Permedia 3, R3, R4) and
Texas Instruments (Permedia, Permedia 2) chips.

CONFIGURATION DETAILS

Please refer to
xorg.conf(5x) for general configuration details. This
section only covers configuration details specific to this
driver.

The driver
auto-detects the chipset type, but the following
ChipSet names may optionally be specified in the
config file "Device" section, and will
override the auto-detection:

"ti_pm2",
"ti_pm", "r4", "pm3",
"pm2v", "pm2", "pm",
"300sx", "500tx", "mx",
"gamma", "gamma2", "delta"

The driver will
try to auto-detect the amount of video memory present for
all chips. If it&rsquo;s not detected correctly, the actual
amount of video memory should be specified with a
VideoRam entry in the config file
"Device" section.

Additionally,
you may need to specify the bus ID of your card with a
BusID entry in the config file
"Device" section, especially with FBDev
support.

The following
driver Options are supported: 
Option "UseFlatPanel"
"boolean"

Enable the FlatPanel feature on
the Permedia3. Default: off.

Option "SWCursor"
"boolean"

Enable or disable the SW
cursor. Default: off. This option disables the
HWCursor option and vice versa.

Option "NoAccel"
"boolean"

Disable or enable acceleration.
Default: acceleration is enabled.

Option
"Overlay"

Enable 8+24 overlay mode. Only
appropriate for depth 24, 32 bpp. (Note: This
hasn&rsquo;t been tested with FBDev support and probably
won&rsquo;t work.) Recognized values are: "8,24",
"24,8". Default: off.

Option "PciRetry"
"boolean"

Enable or disable PCI retries.
(Note: This doesn&rsquo;t work with Permedia2 based
cards for Amigas.) Default: off.

Option "ShadowFB"
"boolean"

Enable or disable use of the
shadow framebuffer layer. (Note: This disables
hardware acceleration.) Default: off.

Option "UseFBDev"
"boolean"

Enable or disable use of an
OS-specific fb interface (which is not supported on all
OSs). See fbdevhw(4) for further information. Default:
off.

Option
"BlockWrite"
"boolean"

Enable or disable block writes
for the various Permedia 2 chips. This improves acceleration
in general, but disables it for some special cases. Default:
off.

Option
"FireGL3000"
"boolean"

If you have a card of the same
name, turn this on. Default: off.
