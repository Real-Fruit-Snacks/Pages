NAME

sane−v4l
− SANE interface for Video for Linux API

DESCRIPTION

The
sane−v4l library implements a SANE (Scanner
Access Now Easy) backend that provides generic access to
video cameras and similar equipment using the V4L (Video for
Linux) API.

This is ALPHA
software. Really! Important features are missing and there
are lots of bugs. The code is currently only tested on a
Linux 2.4 system with a Hauppauge WinTV video card.

DEVICE NAMES

This backend
expects device names of the form:

special

Where
special is the UNIX path-name for the special device
that corresponds to the v4l device. The special device name
must be a v4l device or a symlink to such a device. For
example, such a device name could be /dev/video0 or
/dev/bttv0.

CONFIGURATION

The contents of
the v4l.conf file is a list of device names that
correspond to v4l devices. Empty lines and lines starting
with a hash mark (#) are ignored. A sample configuration
file is shown below:

/dev/bttv0 
# this is a comment 
/dev/video3

FILES

/etc/sane.d/v4l.conf

The backend configuration file
(see also description of SANE_CONFIG_DIR below).

/usr/lib/sane/libsane−v4l.a

The static library implementing
this backend.

/usr/lib/sane/libsane−v4l.so

The shared library implementing
this backend (present on systems that support dynamic
loading).

ENVIRONMENT

SANE_CONFIG_DIR

This environment variable
specifies the list of directories that may contain the
configuration file. Under UNIX, the directories are
separated by a colon (’:’), under OS/2, they are
separated by a semi-colon (’;’). If this
variable is not set, the configuration file is searched in
two default directories: first, the current working
directory (".") and then in /etc/sane.d. If the
value of the environment variable ends with the directory
separator character, then the default directories are
searched after the explicitly specified directories. For
example, setting SANE_CONFIG_DIR to
"/tmp/config:" would result in directories
"tmp/config", ".", and
"/etc/sane.d" being searched (in this order).

SANE_DEBUG_V4L

If the library was compiled
with debug support enabled, this environment variable
controls the debug level for this backend. E.g., a value of
128 requests all debug output to be printed. Smaller levels
reduce verbosity.

BUGS:

If more than
one video card is present, a crash may occur. Frequency and
geometry selection is missing.
