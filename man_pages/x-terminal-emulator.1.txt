NAME
       zutty - Efficient full-featured X11 terminal emulator

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the zutty program.

       This manual page was written for the Debian™ distribution because the
       original program does not have a manual page.

       zutty is a terminal emulator for the X Window System, functionally
       similar to several other X terminal emulators such as xterm, rxvt and
       more. It is also similar to other, much more modern, GPU-accelerated
       terminal emulators.
