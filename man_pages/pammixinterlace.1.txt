NAME
       pammixinterlace - mix adjacent lines to merge interlaced images

SYNOPSIS
       pammixinterlace

       [-filter={linear, fir, ffmpeg}]

       [-adaptive]

       [infile]

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       pammixinterlace  is meant to operate on an image which is the interlac‐
       ing of two images, where raster rows 0, 2, 4, etc. are from  one  image
       and  rows 1, 3, 5, etc. are from another.  (See below for why you might
       expect to encounter such an image).

       pammixinterlace makes each row of the output a mixture  of  the  corre‐
       sponding  row  of the input and its two neighbors.  It uses half of the
       main row and a quarter each of the two neighbor rows.

       This can be useful if the image is a video capture from  an  interlaced
       video source.  In that case, each row shows the subject 1/60 second be‐
       fore or after the two rows that surround it.  If the subject is moving,
       this can detract from the quality of the image.

       In video data streams, you often find each frame contains only half the
       rows of the image -- the odd half or the even half.  The  displayer  of
       the stream displays the rows in their proper positions on a CRT as they
       come in.  When you display the rows in this order,  the  CRT  has  less
       flicker because a particular area of the screen gets refreshed twice as
       often.  In the process of capturing such a stream, computers often gen‐
       erate the interlaced image of the type that pammixinterlace works with.
       But this interlaced image, when displayed on a CRT, does not  look  the
       same  as  if a displayer were rendering the stream directly on a CRT as
       it arrived, because of the timing of when the various pixels get  drawn
       and subsequently fade.  That's why you need something like pammixinter‐
       lace.

       You may prefer the effect of simply extracting one of two images.   You
       can do that with pamdeinterlace.

OPTIONS
       In  addition  to  the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm
       (most notably -quiet, see
        Common Options ⟨index.html#commonoptions⟩  ),  pammixinterlace  recog‐
       nizes the following command line options:

       -filter={linear,fir,ffmpeg}
              This  option  chooses  between one of the three filtering mecha‐
              nisms.  linear is a linear-blend formula.  fir is a  size-5  FIR
              low-pass  filter,  and ffmpeg is a formula pulled from the docu‐
              mentation of the program ffmpeg ⟨http://ffmpeg.mplayerhq.hu⟩ .

              The default is fir.

       -adaptive
              This option turns on "adaptive" filtering mode.   In  this  mode
              pammixinterlace  modifies only pixels that are obviously part of
              a "comb" pattern.
