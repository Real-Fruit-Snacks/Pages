SGE(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual SGE(4)

NAME

sge &mdash; Silicon
Integrated Systems SiS190/191 Fast/Gigabit Ethernet
driver

SYNOPSIS

To compile this driver into the
kernel, place the following lines in your kernel
configuration file:

device
miibus 
device sge

Alternatively,
to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following line in loader.conf(5):

if_sge_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION

The sge device driver
provides support for SiS190 Fast Ethernet controllers and
SiS191 Fast/Gigabit Ethernet controllers.

All LOMs
supported by the sge driver have TCP/UDP/IP checksum
offload for transmit and receive, TCP segmentation offload
(TSO), hardware VLAN tag stripping/insertion features. Due
to lack of documentation Wake On Lan (WOL), Jumbo frame and
an interrupt moderation mechanism are not supported yet.

The sge
driver supports the following media types:

autoselect

Enable
autoselection of the media type and options. The user can
manually override the autoselected mode by adding media
options to rc.conf(5).

10baseT/UTP

Set 10Mbps
operation.

100baseTX

Set 100Mbps
(Fast Ethernet) operation.

1000baseTX

Set 1000baseTX
operation over twisted pair.

The sge
driver supports the following media options:

full-duplex

Force full
duplex operation.

half-duplex

Force half
duplex operation.

For more
information on configuring this device, see ifconfig(8).
