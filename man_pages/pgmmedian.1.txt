NAME
       pgmmedian - apply a median filter to a PGM file

SYNOPSIS
       pgmmedian

       [-width=n]

       [-height=n]

       [-type=median_type]

       [-cutoff=int]

       [pnmfile]

       Minimum  unique abbreviation of option is acceptable.  You may use dou‐
       ble hyphens instead of single hyphen to denote options.   You  may  use
       white space in place of the equals sign to separate an option name from
       its value.

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       pgmmedian applies a median filter to a PGM image, using either the his‐
       togram sort or select kth value method to determine the median.

       A  median  filter is a convolution filter in which the value of a pixel
       in the output is the median of a certain set of pixels in the neighbor‐
       hood  of the corresponding input pixel.  The effect is to eliminate lo‐
       cally extreme values.  Such pixels typically show up as speckles.

       Pixels at the edges of the image, pixels where the  convolution  kernel
       would  go  off the edge of the image, are just copied.  For example, if
       -height is 9, the first 4 and last 4 rows of the input image  are  just
       copied to the output.

       See  the  -type  and  -cutoff  options for information on how pgmmedian
       chooses between the two methods.

OPTIONS
       In addition to the options common to all programs  based  on  libnetpbm
       (most notably -quiet, see
        Common  Options ⟨index.html#commonoptions⟩ ), pgmmedian recognizes the
       following command line options:

       -cutoff int
              This option provides the cutoff value that pgmmedian uses to de‐
              cide between using the histogram sort or select kth value method
              to find the median.

              If (maxval / ((width * height) - 1)), where maxval is the maxval
              of  the  image  and  width  and height are the dimensions of the
              mask, is less than the cutoff value,  pgmmedian  uses  histogram
              sort.  Otherwise, it uses kth value.

              This option has no effect if you specify -type.

              The default is 250

       -width=n
              Width of the median mask to apply.

              Maximum allowed is the width of the input image.

              Default is 3.

       -height=n
              Height of the median mask to apply.

              Maximum allowed is the height of the input image.

              Default is 3.

       -type median_type
              This  option  selects which method to use to find median regard‐
              less of cutoff value.  Choices are histogram_sort and select.

              By default, pgmmedian decides which method to use  as  described
              under the -cutoff option.

HISTORY
       pgmmedian  was  added to Netpbm in Version 10.29 (August 2005).  It had
       been distributed by Mike Burns via his own web site  before  that  (and
       continued to be so).
