NAME

mic - modified
incomplete Cholesky factorization preconditionner
(rheolef-7.2)

SYNOPSIS

solver pa =
mic(a);

DESCRIPTION

mic is
a function that returns the modified incomplete Cholesky
factorization preconditioner as a solver(4). The
method is described in

C-J. Lin and J.
J. More, 
Incomplete Cholesky factorizations with limited memory, 
SIAM J. Sci. Comput. 21(1), pp. 24-45, 1999

It performs the
following incomplete factorization: S P A P^T S
that approximates L L^T where L is a lower
triangular factor, S is a diagonal scaling matrix,
and P is a fill-in reducing permutation as computed
by the AMDcol ordering method.

OPTIONS

This
preconditioner supports an option related to the shifting
strategy: let B = S P A P^T S be the scaled matrix
on which the factorization is carried out, and beta
be the minimum value of the diagonal. If beta >
0 then, the factorization is directly performed on the
matrix B. Otherwise, the factorization is performed
on the shifted matrix B + (shift+|beta|I where
shift is the provided option. The default value is
shift = 0.001. If the factorization fails, then the
shift is doubled until it succeed or a maximum of ten is
reached. If it still fails, it is better to use another
preconditioning technique.

Float shift =
1e-3; 
solver pa = mic (a,shift);
