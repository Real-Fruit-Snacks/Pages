NAME

sane-artec_eplus48u
- SANE backend for the scanner Artec E+ 48U and re-badged
models

DESCRIPTION

The
sane-artec_eplus48u library implements a SANE
(Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to
several USB flatbed scanners using the GT6816 chipset like
the Artec E+ 48U. These scanners have a contact image sensor
(CIS) and an USB interface.

A complete list
of supported devices can be found on
http://www.sane-project.org/sane-supported-devices.html.

This is ALPHA
software. Especially if you test new or untested scanners,
keep your hand at the scanner’s plug and unplug it, if
the head bumps at the end of the scan area.

If you own a
scanner other than the ones mentioned on the list that works
with this backend, please let us know this by sending the
scanner’s exact model name and the USB vendor and
product ids (e.g. from /proc/bus/usb/devices,
sane-find-scanner or syslog) to me. Even if the
scanner’s name is only slightly different from the
models mentioned above, please let me know.

KERNEL ISSUES

If libusb-0.1.6
or later is installed, this section can be skipped. The
scanner should be found by sane-find-scanner without further
actions. For setting permissions and general USB information
look at sane-usb(5).

When you are
using the scanner module, a Linux kernel 2.4.12 or newer is
required.

FIRMWARE FILE

You need a
firmware file for your scanner. That’s a small file
containing software that will be uploaded to the
scanner’s memory. For the scanners mentioned above,
it’s usually named Artec48.usb or 1200.usb. You can
find it on the installation CD that was provided by the
manufacturer, normally in the directory Win98, WinMe or
similar. If the Windows-driver is installed on your
computer, then you can also find the firmware file under
c:\windows\system32\drivers.

CONFIGURATION

The contents of
the artec_eplus48u.conf file is a list of usb lines
containing vendor and product ids that correspond to USB
scanners. The file can also contain option lines. Empty
lines and lines starting with a hash mark (#) are ignored.
The scanners are autodetected by usb vendor_id
product_id statements which are already included into
artec_eplus48u.conf . "vendor_id" and
"product_id" are hexadecimal numbers that identify
the scanner.

Every usb
section can have additional options 
artecFirmwareFile
/usr/share/sane/artec_eplus48u/Artec48.usb

The path to the firmware file.
This option is required.

redGamma 1.0 
greenGamma 1.0 
blueGamma 1.0 
masterGamma 1.9

These are the default gamma
values. If you set the "Defaults" option with a
frontend, then the gamma options are reset to the values
specified here.

redOffset 0x28 
greenOffset 0x2f 
blueOffset 0x2f 
redExposure 0xa7 
greenExposure 0x116 
blueExposure 0xdc

These are the default values
for offset and exposure time. You can e.g. change them to
speed up calibration, if you don’t want to save the
calibration data to disk.

vendorString Artec 
modelString E+ 48U

By default, the scanner is
reported as "Artec E+ 48U". If you don’t
like this, e.g. because you have an Tevion MD 9693, then
change the options accordingly.

FILES

/usr/local/etc/sane.d/artec_eplus48u.conf

The backend configuration file
(see also description of SANE_CONFIG_DIR below).

/usr/local/lib/sane/libsane-artec_eplus48u.a

The static library implementing
this backend.

/usr/local/lib/sane/libsane-artec_eplus48u.so

The shared library implementing
this backend (present on systems that support dynamic
loading).

ENVIRONMENT

SANE_CONFIG_DIR

This environment variable
specifies the list of directories that may contain the
configuration file. Under UNIX, the directories are
separated by a colon (’:’), under OS/2, they are
separated by a semi-colon (’;’). If this
variable is not set, the configuration file is searched in
two default directories: first, the current working
directory (".") and then in /usr/local/etc/sane.d.
If the value of the environment variable ends with the
directory separator character, then the default directories
are searched after the explicitly specified directories. For
example, setting SANE_CONFIG_DIR to
"/tmp/config:" would result in directories
"tmp/config", ".", and
"/usr/local/etc/sane.d" being searched (in this
order).

SANE_DEBUG_ARTEC_EPLUS48U

If the library was compiled
with debug support enabled, this environment variable
controls the debug level for this backend. Higher debug
levels increase the verbosity of the output.

Example: export
SANE_DEBUG_ARTEC_EPLUS48U=3

BUGS

This backend
has been tested on Linux only. If you are using it on a
different platform, please contact us.

Interpolation
with 1200 dpi is weak.

Support for
buttons is missing due to missing support in SANE.

Please contact
us if you find a bug:
