NAME

distributions -
Recommended values for the Distribution header field

DESCRIPTION

The file
pathetc/distributions contains a list of relevant
distributions and their descriptions. It provides local
information for posters who wish to add a Distribution
header field to their articles so as to restrict their
propagation, although it does not guarantee that such
articles will not leak elsewhere because of a
misconfiguration of a news server to which they are fed. See
newsfeeds(5) for more information about how a news server
handles the Distribution header field.

Each line of
this file consists of a distribution area followed by its
description (encoded in UTF-8) after at least a whitespace.
For instance:

fr Local to
France. 
local Local to this news server. 
nj Local to New Jersey. 
usa Local to the United States of America.

Blank lines and
lines beginning with a number sign ("#") are
ignored.

Any client that
issues the LIST DISTRIBUTIONS command obtain these
recommended values, if available. However, be aware that use
of the LIST DISTRIBUTIONS command is not widespread (though
documented in RFC 6048) and most news clients will
never ask for this file.

If this file is
empty, it is not an error. The server will just send the
client an empty response. And if the file is missing, the
server will also send the client an appropriate response to
indicate that the distributions list is not maintained on
the server.

The
Distribution header field can also be automatically set by
nnrpd if distrib.pats(5) is correctly configured.
