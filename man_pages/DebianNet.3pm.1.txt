NAME
       DebianNet - create, remove, enable or disable entry in /etc/inetd.

DESCRIPTION
       You can use the functions in DebianNet to to add, remove, enable or
       disable entries in the /etc/inetd.conf file. After the /etc/inetd.conf
       file has been changed, a SIGHUP signal will be sent to the inetd
       process to make sure that inetd will use the new /etc/inetd.conf file.
       The functions can also be used to add entries that are commented out by
       default. They will be treated like normal entries. That also means that
       if you already have an entry that is commented out you can't add an
       entry for the same service without removing the old one first.

       The DebianNet functions treat entries that are commented out by a
       single '#' character as entries that have been commented out by a user.
       It will not change such entries.

       For shell scripts you can also use the update-inetd command. See
       update-inetd(8) for further information.

VARIABLES
       $DebianNet::INETD_CONF
           Contains a scalar filename to use as the inetd config file (e.g.
           for testing purposes).

           Defaults to /etc/inetd.conf.

       $DebianNet::SEP
           Contains the entry comment characters. This is only necessary if
           you have to deal with two (or more) services of the same name.

           Defaults to "#<off># " as the comment characters.

       $DebianNet::MULTI
           Contains a boolean that decides whether to disable/remove more than
           one entry at a time. If you try to remove more than one entry at a
           time without using this option the program will show a warning and
           will ask the user whether to continue.

           Defaults to false.

       $DebianNet::VERBOSE
           Contains a boolean to select whether to explain verbosely what is
           being done.

           Defaults to false.

FUNCTIONS
       $rc = DebianNet::add_service($newentry, $group)
           Add $newentry to the group $group of the /etc/inetd.conf file. If
           the entry already exist it will be enabled (it will also detect
           entries with different program options). Using $group is optional
           (the default group is the group OTHER). If the group does not exist
           the entry will be placed at the end of the file.

           Returns 1 on success, and -1 on failure. This function might call
           exit() due to debconf prompt answers.

       $rc = DebianNet::remove_service($entry)
           Remove $entry from /etc/inetd.conf. You can use a regular
           expression to remove the entry.

           Returns 1 on success, and -1 on failure.

       $rc = DebianNet::disable_service($service, $pattern)
           Disable $service (e.g. "ftp") in /etc/inetd.conf. Using $pattern is
           optional (see enable_service()).

           Returns 1 on success, and -1 on failure.

       $rc = DebianNet::enable_service($service, $pattern)
           Enable $service (e.g. "ftp") in /etc/inetd.conf. Using $pattern is
           optional. It can be used to select a service. You only need this
           option if you have two (or more) services of the same name.

           An example: you have three ftp entries in the /etc/inetd.conf file
           (all disabled by default) and you want to enable the entry which
           uses the vsftpd daemon. To do this, use the pattern "vsftpd" (or
           any other regular expression that matches this entry).

           Returns 1 on success, and -1 on failure.
