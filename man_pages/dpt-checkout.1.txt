NAME

dpt-checkout -
work on a pkg-perl package

SYNOPSIS

dpt
checkout package-name [package-name
...]

dpt co
package-name [package-name ...]

DESCRIPTION

dpt
checkout checks out a working copy for the packaging of
a given package.

If you use
dpt-shell-lib(1), dpt checkout even puts you
in the directory of working copy if you checked out only one
source package.

If the package
directory exists, the clone is updated by calling
gbp-pull(1). If it doesn&rsquo;t exist, it is cloned
off pkg-perl git repositories via gbp-clone(1).

If there is an
upstream repository information in
debian/upstream/metadata, dpt-upstream-repo(1)
is invoked to add it as a Git remote.

dpt co
is an alias for dpt checkout.

CONFIGURATION

dpt
checkout uses the "DPT_PACKAGES"
environment variable. If "DPT_PACKAGES"
is not defined, the current working directory is used.

See
dpt-config(5) for details.
