NAME
       ppmdim - dim a PPM image

SYNOPSIS
       ppmdim dimfactor [ppmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       This  program  is largely obsoleted by the more general pamfunc(1) (use
       the -multiplier option).  ppmdim remains for backward compatibility and
       also because its use of integer arithmetic may make it faster.

       ppmdim  reads  a  PPM  image input and diminishes its brightness by the
       specified dimfactor.  The dimfactor may be in the range from 0.0 (total
       blackness,  deep night, nada, null, nothing) to 1.0 (original picture's
       brightness).

OPTIONS
       There are no command line options defined specifically for ppmdim,  but
       it  recognizes  the  options  common to all programs based on libnetpbm
       (See
        Common Options ⟨index.html#commonoptions⟩ .)
