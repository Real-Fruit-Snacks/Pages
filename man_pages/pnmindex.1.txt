NAME
       pnmindex - build a visual index of a bunch of PNM images

SYNOPSIS
       pnmindex

       [-size=N]

       [-across=N]

       [-colors=N]

       [-black]

       [-title=title]

       [-quant|-noquant]

       pnmfile ...

       You  can  use  the minimum unique abbreviation of the options.  You can
       use two hyphens instead of one.  You can separate an option  name  from
       its value with white space instead of an equals sign.

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       pnmindex  creates  an index image containing thumbnail (small) versions
       of a bunch of PNM files you supply.  (Akin to a  photographic  "contact
       sheet."

       pnmindex labels each thumbnail and, optionally, contains a title.

       If you just want to concatenate some images together in a grid, use pa‐
       mundice for that.

       If you want to take apart the image you generated  with  pnmindex,  use
       pamdice or pamcut.

       The  program  can generate large temporary files.  By default, these go
       in directory /tmp, but you can usse the TMPDIR environment variable  to
       have them somewhere else.

OPTIONS
       In  addition  to  the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm
       (most notably -quiet, see
        Common Options ⟨index.html#commonoptions⟩ ), pnmindex  recognizes  the
       following command line options:

       -size=N
              The  size  of  each thumbnail.  The image is scaled to fit maxi‐
              mally inside a N x N pixel box without changing its  aspect  ra‐
              tio.  Default is 100.

       -across=N
              The number of thumbnails in each row.  Default is 6.

       -colors=N
              The  maximum  number of colors allowed in the overall image.  If
              it would otherwise have more colors than these,  pnmindex  quan‐
              tizes the result.  The default is 256.

              However,  this  value is meaningless if you specify the -noquant
              option.

       -black This controls the color of the padding between the images;  nor‐
              mally  it's  white  and  the labels are black lettering on white
              background, but the -black option reverses this.

       -title=title
              Specifies a title top place at the top of the image.  Default is
              no title.

       -quant Enables quantization (to the number of colors specified by -col‐
              ors).  Quantization is on by default but you can disable it with
              -noquant.

       -noquant
              See -quant.
