NAME

nbd_get_structured_replies_negotiated
- see if structured replies are in use

SYNOPSIS

#include

int nbd_get_structured_replies_negotiated ( 
struct nbd_handle *h 
);

DESCRIPTION

After
connecting you may call this to find out if the connection
is using structured replies. Note that this setting is
sticky; this can return true even after a second
nbd_opt_structured_reply(3) returns false because the
server detected a duplicate request.

Note that if
the connection negotiates extended headers, this function
returns true (as extended headers imply structured replies)
even if no explicit request for structured replies was
attempted.

RETURN VALUE

This call
returns a boolean value.

ERRORS

On error -1 is
returned.

Refer to
"ERROR HANDLING" in libnbd(3) for how to
get further details of the error.

The following
parameters must not be NULL: "h". For more
information see "Non-NULL parameters" in
