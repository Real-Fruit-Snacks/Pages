NAME

update-cracklib
- Regenerate cracklib dictionary

SYNOPSIS

update-cracklib

DESCRIPTION

update-cracklib
builds a compressed and accumulated version of wordlists
stored in the directories given in cracklibâ€™s
configuration file /etc/cracklib/cracklib.conf. Programs
using cracklib2 need this database to be of any use.

RESULT

update-cracklib
prints out two numbers: the number of words read from the
ASCII dictionaries and the number of words eventually
written into the cracklib database; if no error occurred,
these should be equal.

0 is returned
on success, otherwise an error message is printed to
standard error and -1 is returned.

FILES

/etc/cracklib/cracklib.conf

shell script that sets
cracklib_dictpath_src which must be a space separated
list of source dictionary files.
