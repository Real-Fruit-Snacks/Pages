NAME

nischgrp
&minus; change the group owner of a NIS+ object

SYNOPSIS

nischgrp
[-AfLP] group name...

DESCRIPTION

nischgrp
changes the group owner of the NIS+ objects or
entries specified by name to the specified
NIS+ group. Entries are specified using
indexed names (see nismatch(1)). If group is
not a fully qualified NIS+ group name, it will be
resolved using the directory search path (see
nisdefaults(1)).

The only
restriction on changing an object&rsquo;s group owner is
that you must have modify permissions for the object.

This command
will fail if the master NIS+ server is not
running.

The NIS+
server will check the validity of the group name prior to
effecting the modification.

OPTIONS

The following
options are supported:

-A

Modify all entries in all tables in the concatenation
path that match the search criterion specified in
name. This option implies the -P switch.

-f

Force the operation and fail silently if it does not
succeed. 

-L

Follow links and change the group owner of the linked
object or entries rather than the group owner of the link
itself. 

-P

Follow the concatenation path within a named table. This
option only makes sense when either name is an
indexed name or the -L switch is also specified and
the named object is a link pointing to entries.

EXAMPLES

Example 1:
Using the nischgrp Command

The following
two examples show how to change the group owner of an object
to a group in a different domain, and how to change it to a
group in the local domain, respectively.

example%
nischgrp newgroup.remote.domain. object 
example% nischgrp my-buds object

This example
shows how to change the group owner for a password
entry.

example%
nischgrp admins &rsquo;[uid=99],passwd.org_dir&rsquo;

In the previous
example, admins is a NIS+ group in the same
domain.

The next two
examples change the group owner of the object or entries
pointed to by a link, and the group owner of all entries in
the hobbies table.

example%
nischgrp -L my-buds linkname 
example% nischgrp my-buds &rsquo;[],hobbies&rsquo;

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

NIS_PATH

If this variable is set, and
the NIS+ name is not fully qualified, each directory
specified will be searched until the object is found (see
nisdefaults(1)).

EXIT STATUS

The following
exit values are returned:

0

Successful operation.

1

Operation failed.

NOTES

NIS+ might not
be supported in future releases of the Solaris
TM Operating Environment. Tools to aid the
migration from NIS+ to LDAP are available in the Solaris 9
operating environment. For more information, visit
