DESCRIPTION

racoonctl is used to
control racoon(8) operation, if ipsec-tools was configured
with adminport support. Communication between
racoonctl and racoon(8) is done through a UNIX
socket. By changing the default mode and ownership of the
socket, you can allow non-root users to alter racoon(8)
behavior, so do that with caution.

The following
general options are available:

−d

Debug mode.
Hexdump sent admin port commands.

−l

Increase
verbosity. Mainly for show-sa command.

−s
socket

Specify unix socket name used
to connecting racoon.

The following
commands are available:

reload-config

This should cause racoon(8) to
reload its configuration file.

show-schedule

Unknown command.

show-sa
[isakmp|esp|ah|ipsec]

Dump the SA: All the SAs if no
SA class is provided, or either ISAKMP SAs, IPsec ESP SAs,
IPsec AH SAs, or all IPsec SAs. Use −l to
increase verbosity.

get-sa-cert [ 
inet|inet6] src dst

Output the raw certificate that
was used to authenticate the phase 1 matching src and
dst.

flush-sa
[isakmp|esp|ah|ipsec]

is used to flush all SAs if no
SA class is provided, or a class of SAs, either ISAKMP SAs,
IPsec ESP SAs, IPsec AH SAs, or all IPsec SAs.

establish-sa [ 
−w] [ 
−n remoteconf] [ 
−u username] saopts

Establish an SA, either an
ISAKMP SA, IPsec ESP SA, or IPsec AH SA. The optional
−u username can be used when
establishing an ISAKMP SA while hybrid auth is in use. The
exact remote block to use can be specified with
−n remoteconf. racoonctl will
prompt you for the password associated with username
and these credentials will be used in the Xauth
exchange.

Specifying
−w will make racoonctl wait until the SA is
actually established or an error occurs.

saopts
has the following format:

isakmp {inet|inet6} src
dst

{esp|ah} {inet|inet6}
src/prefixlen/port dst/prefixlen/port

{icmp|tcp|udp|gre|any}

vpn-connect [ 
−u username] vpn_gateway

This is a particular case of
the previous command. It will establish an ISAKMP SA with
vpn_gateway.

delete-sa saopts

Delete an SA, either an ISAKMP
SA, IPsec ESP SA, or IPsec AH SA.

vpn-disconnect
vpn_gateway

This is a particular case of
the previous command. It will kill all SAs associated with
vpn_gateway.

show-event

Listen for all events reported
by racoon(8).

logout-user login

Delete all SA established on
behalf of the Xauth user login.
