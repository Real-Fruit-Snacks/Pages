NAME

uuencode -
format of an encoded uuencode file

DESCRIPTION

Files output by
uuencode(1) consist of a header line, followed by a number
of body lines, and a trailer line. The uudecode(1) command
will ignore any lines preceding the header or following the
trailer. Lines preceding a header must not, of course, look
like a header.

The header line
is distinguished by having the first 5 characters be
begin followed by a space, or else a hyphen and
either base64 or encoded or both (also
separated with a hyphen). The base64 option says the
file has been encoded using base64. The encoded
option says the output file name has been base64
encoded. It is never encoded with traditional uuencoding.
This is a GNU extension. These are followed by a mode (in
octal), and a string which names the remote file. The mode
is separated from the begin clause and the file name
by a single space character.

Traditional
uuencoding 
The traditional uuencoded file body consists of a
number of lines, each at most 62 characters long (including
the trailing newline). These consist of a character count
letter, followed by the encoded characters, followed by a
newline. The character count is a single printing character,
and represents an integer, the number of bytes the rest of
the line represents. Such integers are always in the range
from 0 to 63 and can be determined by subtracting the
character space (octal 40) from the character.

Groups of 3
bytes are stored in 4 characters, 6 bits per character. All
are offset by a space to make the characters printing. The
last line may be shorter than the normal 45 bytes. If the
size is not a multiple of 3, this fact can be determined by
the value of the count on the last line. Extra garbage will
be included to make the character count a multiple of 4. The
body is terminated by a line with a count of zero. This line
consists of one ASCII space.

The trailer
line consists of end on a line by itself.

base64
encoding 
base64 encoded files follow the specified format for the
body, but also include a begin-base64 header and a
trailer line of four = characters.

EXAMPLES

begin-base64-encoded
644 VE9ETw==

This introduces a base64
encoded file named, TODO with that name encoded using
base64 encoding.

begin-encoded
644 5$]$3P&rsquo;&rsquo;

This introduces an encoded file
named, TODO with that name encoded using uuencoding.
The encoding is a lot less friendly. Please prefer base64
encoding.

CONFORMING TO

IEEE Std
1003.1, plus extensions

The
-encoded suffix to the begin header line is a
GNU extension. Recipients must have the GNU uudecode
program to decode them.
