NAME

sasl_getrealm_t
- Cyrus SASL documentation

SYNOPSIS

#include

int
sasl_getrealm_t(void *context, 
int id, 
const char **availrealms, 
const char **result)

DESCRIPTION

int
sasl_getrealm_t(void *context, 
int id, 
const char **availrealms, 
const char **result)

sasl_getrealm_t() is
used when there is an interaction with SASL_CB_GETREALM as
the type.

If a mechanism
would use this callback, but it is not present, then the
first realm listed is automatically selected. (Note that a
mechanism may still force the existence of a getrealm
callback by SASL_CB_GETREALM to its required_prompts list).

Parameters

&bull;

context &ndash; context from the callback
record 

&bull;

id &ndash; callback ID (SASL_CB_GETREALM)

&bull;

availrealms &ndash; A string list of the
available realms. NULL terminated, may be empty.

&bull;

result &ndash; The chosen realm. (a NUL
terminated string)

RETURN VALUE

SASL callback
functions should return SASL return codes. See sasl.h for a
complete list. SASL_OK indicates success.

Other return
codes indicate errors and should be handled.
