NG_HUB(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual NG_HUB(4)

NAME

ng_hub &mdash; packet
distribution netgraph node type

SYNOPSIS

#include

DESCRIPTION

The hub node type
provides a simple mechanism for distributing packets over
several links. Packets received on any of the hooks are
forwarded out the other hooks. Packets are not altered in
any way.

HOOKS

A hub node accepts any
request to connect, regardless of the hook name, as long as
the name is unique.

CONTROL MESSAGES

This node type supports the
generic control messages, plus the following:

NGM_HUB_SET_PERSISTENT
(setpersistent)

This command sets the
persistent flag on the node, and takes no arguments.

SHUTDOWN

This node shuts down upon
receipt of a NGM_SHUTDOWN control message, or when all hooks
have been disconnected. Setting the persistent flag via a
NGM_HUB_SET_PERSISTENT control message disables automatic
node shutdown when the last hook gets disconnected.

appeared in FreeBSD 5.3.
