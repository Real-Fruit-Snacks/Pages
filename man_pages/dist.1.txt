DESCRIPTION

dist is
similar to forw. It prepares the specified message
for redistribution to addresses that (presumably) are not on
the original address list.

The default
message form contains the following elements:

Resent-From:
{from switch} or  or

Resent-To: {to switch} or blank 
Resent-cc: {cc switch} or blank 
Resent-fcc: {fcc switch} or blank

If a file named
&ldquo;distcomps&rdquo; exists in the user&rsquo;s
nmh directory, it will be used instead of this default form.
You may specify an alternate forms file with the switch
-form formfile. Forms are processed via the
nmh template system; see mh-format(5) for
details. Components from the redistributed message are
available as standard component escapes in the forms
file.

In addition to
the standard mh-format(5) escapes, the following
component escapes are also supported:

Description

fcc

string

Any folders specified with
&rsquo;-fcc folder&rsquo; 

nmh-from

string

Addresses specified with
&rsquo;-from address&rsquo; 

nmh-to

string

Addresses specified with
&rsquo;-to address&rsquo; 

nmh-cc

string

Addresses specified with
&rsquo;-cc address&rsquo; 

See
forw(1) for descriptions of the -from,
-to, -cc, and -fcc switches.

If the draft
already exists, dist will ask you as to the
disposition of the draft. A reply of quit will abort
dist, leaving the draft intact; replace will
replace the existing draft with a blank skeleton; and
list will display the draft.

Only those
addresses in &ldquo;Resent-To:&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Resent-cc:&rdquo;, and
&ldquo;Resent-Bcc:&rdquo; will be sent. Also, a
&ldquo;Resent-Fcc: folder&rdquo; will be honored (see
send(1)). Note that with dist, the draft
should contain only &ldquo;Resent-xxx:&rdquo; fields
and no body. The headers and the body of the original
message are copied to the draft when the message is sent.
Use care in constructing the headers for the
redistribution.

Because the
draft is minimal, the prompter(1) editor is quite
useful with dist.

If the
-annotate switch is given, the message being
distributed will be annotated with the lines:

Resent: date 
Resent: addrs

where each address list
contains as many lines as required. This annotation will be
done only if the message is sent directly from dist.
If the message is not sent immediately from dist,
&ldquo;comp -use&rdquo; may be used to re-edit and
send the constructed message, but the annotations
won&rsquo;t take place. Normally annotations are done in
place in order to preserve any links to the message. You may
use the -noinplace switch to change this.

See
comp(1) for a description of the -editor and
-noedit switches. Note that while in the editor, with
-atfile and if the current directory is writable, the
message being resent is available through a link named
&ldquo;@&rdquo; (assuming the default whatnowproc).
In addition, the actual pathname of the message is stored in
the environment variable $editalt, and the pathname
of the folder containing the message is stored in the
environment variable $mhfolder. The creation of the
&ldquo;@&rdquo; file is controlled via the -atfile
and -noatfile options.

The
-draftfolder +folder and -draftmessage
msg switches invoke the nmh draft folder
facility. This is an advanced (and highly useful) feature.
Consult mh-draft(5) for more information.

Upon exiting
from the editor, dist will invoke the whatnow
program. See whatnow(1) for a discussion of available
options. The invocation of this program can be inhibited by
using the -nowhatnowproc switch. (In fact, it is the
whatnow program which starts the initial edit. Hence,
-nowhatnowproc will prevent any edit from
occurring.)

skeleton.

$HOME/.mh_profile

The user&rsquo;s profile.

/draft

The draft file.

PROFILE COMPONENTS

Path:

To determine the user&rsquo;s
nmh directory.

Current-Folder:

To find the default current folder.

Draft-Folder:

To specify the default draftfolder.

DEFAULTS

+folder

The current folder.

msg

The current message.

-noannotate

-nodraftfolder

-inplace

-noatfile

CONTEXT

If a folder is given, it will
become the current folder. The message distributed will
become the current message.

HISTORY

dist
originally used headers of the form
&ldquo;Distribute-xxx:&rdquo; instead of
&ldquo;Resent-xxx:&rdquo;. In order to conform with
the ARPA Internet standard, RFC 822, the
&ldquo;Resent-xxx:&rdquo; form is now used.
dist will recognize
&ldquo;Distribute-xxx:&rdquo; type headers and
automatically convert them to
&ldquo;Resent-xxx:&rdquo;.

BUGS

dist
does not rigorously check the message being distributed for
adherence to the transport standard, but post called
by send does. The post program will balk (and
rightly so) at poorly formatted messages, and dist
won&rsquo;t correct things for you.

If
whatnowproc is whatnow, then comp uses
a built-in whatnow, it does not actually run the
whatnow program. Hence, if you define your own
whatnowproc, don&rsquo;t call it whatnow since
comp won&rsquo;t run it.
