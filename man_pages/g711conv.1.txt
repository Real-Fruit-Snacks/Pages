G711CONV(1) BSD General Commands Manual G711CONV(1)

NAME

g711conv —
conversions according to G.711

SYNOPSIS

g711conv
[−a] [−u] [−P]
[−A] [−R]

DESCRIPTION

The g711conv utility is
part of the isdn4bsd package and is used to convert between
the A-Law and u-law formats as specified in ITU G.711. It is
based on a freely available and freely usable reference
implementation done by Sun Microsystems, Inc.

The following
options are available:

−a

Convert A-law
to u-law

−u

Convert u-law
to A-law

−r

Reverse bits
before conversion

−R

Reverse bits
after conversion

−P

Print the
resulting conversion tables (as C-source) to stdout instead
of doing the actual conversion.

STANDARDS

A-Law and u-Law conversions are
specified in ITU Recommendation G.711.

The reference
implementation done by Sun Microsystems, Inc. is available
from
http://www.itu.int/itudoc/itu-t/rec/g/g700-799/refimpl.txt

EXAMPLES

The command:

g711conv -P
-a

prints out the
A-law to u-law conversion table as C-source to stdout.

The command:

cat
max_headroom.ul | g711conv -u -R > /dev/i4btel0

converts the
u-law coded voice of Max Headroom to A-law, reverses the
bits of the result and moves that to an active isdn4bsd
telephone connection.
