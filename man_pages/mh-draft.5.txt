NAME

mh-draft -
draft folder facility for nmh message system

DESCRIPTION

There are a
number of interesting advanced facilities for the
composition of outgoing mail.

The Draft
Folder 
The comp, dist, forw, repl,
send, and whom commands each take the switches
-draftfolder +folder and -draftmessage
msg, which allow you to manipulate the various draft
messages you are composing.

If
-draftfolder +folder is used, draft messages
will be constructed in the indicated folder. The
&ldquo;Draft-Folder&rdquo; profile entry may be used
to specify a default draft folder.

If the switch
-draftmessage msg is given, the specified
draft is used to compose the message. If
-draftmessage msg is not used, then the draft
defaults to &rsquo;new&rsquo; (create a new draft) unless
the user invokes comp with -use, in which case
the default is &rsquo;cur&rsquo;.

Hence, the user
may have several message compositions in progress
simultaneously. Now, all of the nmh tools are
available on each of the user&rsquo;s message drafts (e.g.
show, scan, pick, and so on). If the
folder does not exist, the user is asked if it should be
created (just like with refile). The last draft
message the user was composing is known as &rsquo;cur&rsquo;
in the draft folder.

Using
send, the user can send drafts using the standard
nmh &rsquo;msgs&rsquo; convention with
-draftmessage msgs. If no &rsquo;msgs&rsquo;
are given, it defaults to &rsquo;cur&rsquo;.

In addition,
all of these programs have a -nodraftfolder switch,
which undoes the last occurrence of -draftfolder
folder (useful if a default is specified in the
user&rsquo;s nmh profile).

If the user
does not give the -draftfolder +folder switch,
then all these commands act &ldquo;normally&rdquo;. Note
that the -draft switch to send and show
still refers to the file called &rsquo;draft&rsquo; in the
user&rsquo;s nmh directory. In the interests of
economy of expression, when using comp or
send, the user needn&rsquo;t prefix the draft
&rsquo;msg&rsquo; or &rsquo;msgs&rsquo; with
-draftmessage. Both of these commands accept a
&rsquo;file&rsquo; or &rsquo;files&rsquo; argument and they
will, if given -draftfolder +folder, treat
these arguments as &rsquo;msg&rsquo; or &rsquo;msgs&rsquo;.
(This may appear to be inconsistent, at first, but it saves
a lot of typing.) Hence,

send
-draftfolder +drafts first

is the same
as

send
-draftfolder +drafts -draftmessage first

To make all
this a bit more clear, here are some examples. Let&rsquo;s
assume that the following entries are in the nmh
profile:

Draft-Folder:
drafts 
sendf: -draftfolder +drafts

Furthermore,
let&rsquo;s assume that the program sendf is a
(symbolic) link in the user&rsquo;s $HOME/bin/
directory to send. Now,

comp 
dist 
forw 
repl

will construct
the message draft in the &rsquo;drafts&rsquo; folder using
the &rsquo;new&rsquo; message number. Furthermore, they each
define &rsquo;cur&rsquo; in this folder to be that message
draft. If the user were to use the quit option at the
&rsquo;What now?&rsquo; prompt, then later on, if no other
draft composition was done, the draft could be sent with
simply

sendf

Or, if more
editing was required, the draft could be edited with

comp -use

If other drafts
had been composed in the meantime, so that this message
draft was no longer known as &rsquo;cur&rsquo; in the
&rsquo;draft&rsquo; folder, then the user could scan
the folder to see which message draft should be used for
editing or sending. Clever users could even employ a
backquoted pick to do the work:

comp -use `pick
+drafts -to nmh-workers`

or

sendf `pick
+drafts -to nmh-workers`

Note that in
the comp example, the output from pick must
resolve to a single message draft (it makes no sense to talk
about composing two or more drafts with one invocation of
comp). In contrast, in the send example, as
many message drafts as desired can appear, since send
doesn&rsquo;t mind sending more than one draft at a
time.

Note that the
argument -draftfolder +folder is not included
in the profile entry for send, since when
comp, et al, invoke send directly, they supply
send with the Unix pathname of the message draft;
not a -draftmessage msg argument. As
far as send is concerned, a draft folder is not being
used.

It is important
to realize that nmh treats the draft folder like a
standard nmh folder in nearly all respects. There are
two exceptions:

First, under no
circumstances will the -draftfolder folder
switch cause the named folder to become the current folder.
Obviously, if the folder appeared in the context of a
standard +folder argument to an nmh program,
as in

scan
+drafts

it might become
the current folder, depending on the context changes of the
nmh program in question.

Second,
although conceptually send deletes the
&rsquo;msgs&rsquo; named in the draft folder, it does not
call delete-prog to perform the deletion.

What Happens
if the Draft Exists 
When the comp, dist, forw, and
repl commands are invoked and the draft you indicated
already exists, these programs will prompt the user for a
response directing the program&rsquo;s action. The prompt
is

Draft
"/home/foobar/nmhbox/draft" exists (xx bytes).

Disposition?

The appropriate
responses and their meanings are:

replace

deletes the draft and starts afresh

list

lists the draft

refile

files the draft into a folder and starts afresh

quit

leaves the draft intact and exits

In addition, if
you specified -draftfolder folder to the
command, then one other response will be accepted:

new

creates a new draft

just as if
-draftmessage new had been given. Finally, the
comp command will accept one more response:

use

re-uses the draft

just as if
-use had been given.
