DESCRIPTION

This page
documents how to use virt-v2v(1) to convert guests to
an oVirt or RHV management instance. There are three output
modes that you can select, but only -o rhv-upload
should be used normally, the other two are deprecated:

-o rhv-upload -os STORAGE

Full description: "OUTPUT
TO RHV"

This is the
modern method for uploading to oVirt/RHV via the REST API.
It requires oVirt/RHV ≥ 4.2.

-o rhv -os esd:/path

-o rhv -os /path

Full description: "OUTPUT
TO EXPORT STORAGE DOMAIN"

This is the old
method for uploading to oVirt/RHV via the Export Storage
Domain (ESD). The ESD can either be accessed over NFS (using
the -os esd:/path form) or if you have already
NFS-mounted it somewhere specify the path to the mountpoint
as -os /path.

The Export
Storage Domain was deprecated in oVirt 4, and so we expect
that this method will stop working at some point in the
future.

-o vdsm

This is the old method used
internally by the RHV-M user interface. It is never intended
to be used directly by end users.

OUTPUT TO RHV

This new method
to upload guests to oVirt or RHV directly via the REST API
requires oVirt/RHV ≥ 4.2.

You need to
specify -o rhv-upload as well as the following extra
parameters: 
-oc
"https://ovirt-engine.example.com/ovirt-engine/api"

The URL of the REST API which
is usually the server name with
"/ovirt-engine/api" appended, but might be
different if you installed oVirt Engine on a different
path.

You can
optionally add a username and port number to the URL. If the
username is not specified then virt-v2v defaults to using
"admin@internal" which is the typical superuser
account for oVirt instances.

-of raw

Currently you must use -of
raw and you cannot use -oa preallocated.

These
restrictions will be loosened in a future version.

-op password-file

A file containing a password to
be used when connecting to the oVirt engine. Note the file
should contain the whole password, without any trailing
newline, and for security the file should have mode 0600
so that others cannot read it.

-os
"ovirt-data"

The storage domain.

-oo
rhv-cafile=ca.pem

The ca.pem file
(Certificate Authority), copied from
/etc/pki/ovirt-engine/ca.pem on the oVirt engine.

If -oo
rhv-verifypeer is enabled then this option can be used
to control which CA is used to verify the client’s
identity. If this option is not used then the system’s
global trust store is used.

-oo
rhv-cluster="CLUSTERNAME"

Set the RHV Cluster Name. If
not given it uses "Default".

-oo
rhv-disk-uuid="UUID"

This option can used to
manually specify UUIDs for the disks when creating the
virtual machine. If not specified, the oVirt engine will
generate random UUIDs for the disks. Please note that:

•

you must pass as many -oo
rhv-disk-uuid=UUID options as the amount of disks in the
guest 

•

the specified UUIDs must not conflict with the UUIDs of
existing disks

-oo rhv-proxy

Proxy the upload through oVirt
Engine. This is slower than uploading directly to the oVirt
node but may be necessary if you do not have direct network
access to the nodes.

-oo rhv-verifypeer

Verify the oVirt/RHV
server’s identity by checking the server’s
certificate against the Certificate Authority.

OUTPUT TO EXPORT STORAGE DOMAIN

This section
only applies to the -o rhv output mode. If you use
virt-v2v from the RHV-M user interface, then behind the
scenes the import is managed by VDSM using the -o
vdsm output mode (which end users should not try to use
directly).

You have to
specify -o rhv and an -os option that points
to the RHV-M Export Storage Domain. You can either specify
the NFS server and mountpoint, eg.
"-os rhv-storage:/rhv/export", or you can
mount that first and point to the directory where it is
mounted, eg. "-os /tmp/mnt". Be careful not
to point to the Data Storage Domain by accident as that will
not work.

On successful
completion virt-v2v will have written the new guest to the
Export Storage Domain, but it will not yet be ready to run.
It must be imported into RHV using the UI before it can be
used.

In RHV ≥ 2.2
this is done from the Storage tab. Select the export domain
the guest was written to. A pane will appear underneath the
storage domain list displaying several tabs, one of which is
"VM Import". The converted guest will be listed
here. Select the appropriate guest an click
"Import". See the RHV documentation for additional
details.

If you export
several guests, then you can import them all at the same
time through the UI.

Testing RHV
conversions 
If you do not have an oVirt or RHV instance to test against,
then you can test conversions by creating a directory
structure which looks enough like a RHV-M Export Storage
Domain to trick virt-v2v:

uuid=`uuidgen`

mkdir /tmp/rhv 
mkdir /tmp/rhv/$uuid 
mkdir /tmp/rhv/$uuid/images 
mkdir /tmp/rhv/$uuid/master 
mkdir /tmp/rhv/$uuid/master/vms 
touch /tmp/rhv/$uuid/dom_md 
virt-v2v [...] -o rhv -os /tmp/rhv

Debugging
RHV-M import failures 
When you export to the RHV-M Export Storage Domain, and then
import that guest through the RHV-M UI, you may encounter an
import failure. Diagnosing these failures is infuriatingly
difficult as the UI generally hides the true reason for the
failure.

There are
several log files of interest: 
/var/log/vdsm/import/

In oVirt ≥ 4.1.0, VDSM
preserves the virt-v2v log file for 30 days in this
directory.

This directory
is found on the host which performed the conversion. The
host can be selected in the import dialog, or can be found
under the "Events" tab in oVirt
administration.

/var/log/vdsm/vdsm.log

As above, this file is present
on the host which performed the conversion. It contains
detailed error messages from low-level operations executed
by VDSM, and is useful if the error was not caused by
virt-v2v, but by VDSM.

/var/log/ovirt-engine/engine.log

This log file is stored on the
RHV-M server. It contains more detail for any errors caused
by the oVirt GUI.
