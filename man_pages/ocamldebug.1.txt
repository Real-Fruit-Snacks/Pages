NAME

ocamldebug -
the OCaml source-level replay debugger.

SYNOPSIS

ocamldebug
[ options ] program [ arguments ]

DESCRIPTION

ocamldebug
is the OCaml source-level replay debugger.

Before the
debugger can be used, the program must be compiled and
linked with the -g option: all .cmo and .cma files
that are part of the program should have been created with
ocamlc -g, and they must be linked together with
ocamlc -g.

Compiling with
-g entails no penalty on the running time of
programs: object files and bytecode executable files are
bigger and take longer to produce, but the executable files
run at exactly the same speed as if they had been compiled
without -g.

OPTIONS

A summary of
options are included below. For a complete description, see
the html documentation in the ocaml-doc package. 
-c count

Set the maximum number of
simultaneously live checkpoints to count.

-cd dir

Run the debugger program from
the working directory dir, instead of the current
working directory. (See also the cd command.)

-emacs

Tell the debugger it is executed under Emacs. (See
The OCaml user’s manual for information on how
to run the debugger under Emacs.) Implies
-machine-readable. 

-I directory

Add directory to the
list of directories searched for source files and compiled
files. (See also the directory command.)

-machine-readable

Print information in a format
more suitable for machines instead of human operators where
applicable. For example, when describing a location in a
program, such as when printing a backtrace, print the
program counter and character offset in a file instead of
the filename, line number, and character offset in that
line.

-s socket

Use socket for
communicating with the debugged program. See the description
of the command set socket in The OCaml
user’s manual for the format of socket.

-version

Print version string and
exit.

-vnum

Print short version number and exit.

-help or --help

Display a short usage summary
and exit.

INITIALIZATION FILE

When
ocamldebug(1) is invoked, it will read commands from
an initialization file before giving control to the user.
The default file is .ocamldebug in the current
directory if it exists, otherwise .ocamldebug in the
user’s home directory.

Note that you
can also use the source file command to read commands
from a file.
