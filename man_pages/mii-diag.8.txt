NAME

mii-diag -
Examine and set the MII registers of a network interface

SYNOPSIS

mii-diag
[options] [interface]

DESCRIPTION

mii-diag
is a program that you can use to diagnose and solve most
problems with network interfaces. interface defaults
to eth0.

OPTIONS

These programs
follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options
starting with two dashes (’-’). A summary of
options is included below. 
−h, −? −−help

Show summary of options.

−v,
−−version

Show version.

−V,
−−verbose

Verbose mode

−D,
−−debug

Debug mode

−a,
−−all

Show all interfaces (Not
recommended with options that change settings.)

−A,
−−advertise [Mode]

Change the capabilities
advertised by your network interface. Currently the
following modes are allowed: 100baseT4, 100baseTx
100baseTx-FD, 100baseTx-HD, 10baseT, 10baseT-FD and
10baseT-HD.

−f,
−−force

Force the operation

−F,
−−fixedspeed

Force your network interface to
a speed mode. Currently the following modes are allowed:
100baseT4, 100baseTx 100baseTx-FD, 100baseTx-HD, 10baseT,
10baseT-FD and 10baseT-HD.

−g,
−−read-parameters

Get driver-specific
parameters.

−G,
−−set-parameters [Options]

Set driver-specific parameters.
Parameters are comma separated, missing elements retain
existing value. Write general settings value. Only use this,
if you know what you are doing!

−p,
−−phy

Set the PHY (MII address) to
from which mii-diag generates the report.

−r,
−−restart

Restart the link
negotiation.

−R,
−−Reset

Reset the transceiver.

−s,
−−status

Exit with status 0 if link beat
is found, or 2 if not.

−C, −−BMCR
[integer value]

Set the Basic Mode Control
Register to . The meaning of the bits are: 
* 0x0080 - Internal Collision Test enabled 
* 0x0100 - Full Duplex (Half otherwise) 
* 0x0200 - Restarted auto-negotiation in progress 
* 0x0400 - Transceiver isolated from the MII 
* 0x0800 - Transceiver powered down 
* 0x1000 - Auto-negotiation enabled. 
* 0x2000 - 100 Mbit (10 Mbit elsewise) 
* 0x4000 - Transceiver in loopback mode 
* 0x8000 - Transceiver currently being reset

−m,
−−monitor

Monitor status registers.

−w,
−−watch

Continuously monitor the
transceiver and report changes.
