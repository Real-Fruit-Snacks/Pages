NAME

sctp_recvv -
Receive a message from a SCTP socket with an extensible
way.

SYNOPSIS

int
sctp_recvv(int sd, const struct iovec *
iov, int iovlen, 
struct sockaddr * from, socklen_t *
fromlen, void * info, 
socklen_t * infolen, unsigned int *
infotype, int * flags);

DESCRIPTION

sctp_recvv
provides an extensible way for the SCTP stack to pass up
different SCTP attributes associated with a received message
to an application. There are two types of attributes that
can be returned by this call: the attribute of the received
message and the attribute of the next message in the receive
buffer. The caller enables the SCTP_RECVRCVINFO and
SCTP_RECVNXTINFO socket options, respectively, to receive
these attributes. Attributes of the received message are
returned in struct sctp_rcvinfo, and attributes of the next
message are returned in struct sctp_nxtinfo. If both options
are enabled, both attributes are returned using the
following structure.

struct
sctp_recvv_rn { 
struct sctp_rcvinfo recvv_rcvinfo; 
struct sctp_nxtinfo recvv_nxtinfo; 
};

sd is
the socket descriptor. iov is the scatter buffer, and
only one user message is returned in this buffer.
iovlen is the number of elements in iov. from
is a pointer to a buffer to be filled with the sender of the
received message&rsquo;s address. fromlen is an
in/out parameter describing the from length. info is
a pointer to the buffer to hold the attributes of the
received message, the structure type of info is determined
by the info_type parameter. infolen is an in/out
parameter describing the size of the info buffer. On return,
infotype is set to the type of the info buffer, and
the current defined values are as follows: 
SCTP_RECVV_NOINFO

If neither SCTP_RECVRCVINFO nor
SCTP_RECVNXTINFO options are enabled, no attribute will be
returned. If only the SCTP_RECVNXTINFO option is enabled but
there is no next message in the buffer, no attribute will be
returned. In these cases, *info_type will be set to
SCTP_RECVV_NOINFO.

SCTP_RECVV_RCVINFO

The type of info is struct
sctp_rcvinfo, and the attribute relates to the received
message.

SCTP_RECVV_NXTINFO

The type of info is struct
sctp_nxtinfo, and the attribute relates to the next message
in the receive buffer. This is the case when only the
SCTP_RECVNXTINFO option is enabled and there is a next
message in the buffer.

SCTP_RECVV_RN

The type of info is struct
sctp_recvv_rn. The recvv_rcvinfo field is the attribute of
the received message, and the recvv_nxtinfo field is the
attribute of the next message in the buffer. This is the
case when both SCTP_RECVRCVINFO and SCTP_RECVNXTINFO options
are enabled and there is a next message in the receive
buffer.

flags is
pointer to an integer to be filled with any message flags
(e.g., MSG_NOTIFICATION).

RETURN VALUE

On success,
sctp_recvv returns the number of bytes received or -1
if an error occurred.
