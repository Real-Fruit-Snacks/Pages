NAME

aupanel -
allows user adjustment of Network Audio System device
attributes

SYNOPSIS

aupanel
[-audio servername] [-device id]
[-interval seconds]

DESCRIPTION

aupanel
provides an X-based window-oriented interface allowing the
user to adjust the attributes of the devices provided by the
Network Audio System service.

OPTIONS

The following
options may be used with aupanel: 
-audio servername

This option specifies the
Network Audio System server to contact.

-device id

This option specifies the
initially activated audio device on the server. If the
id is a decimal number n, the
nth device returned by the server is used. If
it is a hexadecimal number (starting with 0x) it is
used as the resource identifier of the desired device.
Otherwise, id should be the exact device name (e.g.
Stereo Channel Output). You can use auinfo to query
an audioserver for this information.

-interval
seconds

aupanel queries the
device attributes in regular intervals with a default length
of 10 seconds. With this option a different interval
length can be specified. Using an interval length of
0 disables the automatic querying.

Additionally,
options from the Athena Widget Set can be used.

AUPANEL AND THE ATHENA WIDGET SET

aupanel
uses the X Toolkit Intrinsics and the Athena Widget Set. For
more information, see the Athena Widget Set
documentation.

ADJUSTING DEVICE ATTRIBUTES

To adjust the
attributes of a device, select the desired device from the
Devices menu. The device gain may be adjusted using
the Gain slider. If applicable, the device input mode
can be toggled between Line-In and Microphone
by clicking on the appropriate box. If applicable, the
device output mode can be selected by clicking on the
Speaker, Headphone, and Line-Out boxes.
Some output devices may support combinations of these
selections.

To query the
current device attributes, click on the Query
button.

To mute (resp.
unmute) the current device, click on the Mute
button.

ENVIRONMENT

In addition to
the standard toolkit environment variables, the following
environment variables are used by aupanel: 
AUDIOSERVER

This variable specifies the
default audio server to contact if -audio is not
specified on the command line. If this variable is not set
and the -audio is not specified on the command line,
aupanel will attempt to connect to the audio server
running on the X Window System display.
