NAME
       jconsole  - start a graphical console to monitor and manage Java appli‐
       cations

SYNOPSIS
       jconsole [-interval=n] [-notile] [-plugin path] [-version]  [connection
       ...  ] [-Jinput_arguments]

       jconsole -help

OPTIONS
       -interval
              Sets the update interval to n seconds (default is 4 seconds).

       -notile
              Doesn't tile the windows for two or more connections.

       -pluginpath path
              Specifies  the path that jconsole uses to look up plug-ins.  The
              plug-in path should contain a provider-configuration file  named
              META-INF/services/com.sun.tools.jconsole.JConsolePlugin     that
              contains one line for each plug-in.  The line specifies the ful‐
              ly   qualified   class   name  of  the  class  implementing  the
              com.sun.tools.jconsole.JConsolePlugin class.

       -version
              Prints the program version.

       connection = pid | host:port | jmxURL
              A connection is described by either pid, host:port or jmxURL.

              • The pid value is the process ID of a target process.  The  JVM
                must  be  running with the same user ID as the user ID running
                the jconsole command.

              • The host:port values are the name of the host system on  which
                the  JVM is running, and the port number specified by the sys‐
                tem property com.sun.management.jmxremote.port  when  the  JVM
                was started.

              • The  jmxUrl  value  is the address of the JMX agent to be con‐
                nected to as described in JMXServiceURL.

       -Jinput_arguments
              Passes input_arguments to the JVM on which the jconsole  command
              is run.

       -help or --help
              Displays the help message for the command.

DESCRIPTION
       The jconsole command starts a graphical console tool that lets you mon‐
       itor and manage Java applications and virtual machines on  a  local  or
       remote machine.

       On  Windows, the jconsole command doesn't associate with a console win‐
       dow.  It does, however, display a dialog  box  with  error  information
       when the jconsole command fails.
