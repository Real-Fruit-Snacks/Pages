名称
       lastlog - 报告所有用户的最近登录情况，或者指定用户的最近登录情况

大纲
       lastlog [选项]

描述
       lastlog formats and prints the contents of the last login log
       /var/log/lastlog file. The login-name, port, and last login time will
       be printed. The default (no flags) causes lastlog entries to be
       printed, sorted by their order in /etc/passwd.

选项
       The options which apply to the lastlog command are:

       -b, --before DAYS
           Print only lastlog records older than DAYS.

       -C, --clear
           Clear lastlog record of a user. This option can be used only
           together with -u (--user)).

       -h, --help
           显示帮助信息并退出。

       -R, --root CHROOT_DIR
           Apply changes in the CHROOT_DIR directory and use the configuration
           files from the CHROOT_DIR directory. Only absolute paths are
           supported.

       -S, --set
           Set lastlog record of a user to the current time. This option can
           be used only together with -u (--user)).

       -t, --time DAYS
           Print the lastlog records more recent than DAYS.

       -u, --user LOGIN|RANGE
           显示指定用户的最近登录记录。

           The users can be specified by a login name, a numerical user ID, or
           a RANGE of users. This RANGE of users can be specified with a min
           and max values (UID_MIN-UID_MAX), a max value (-UID_MAX), or a min
           value (UID_MIN-).

       If the user has never logged in the message ** Never logged in** will
       be displayed instead of the port and time.

       Only the entries for the current users of the system will be displayed.
       Other entries may exist for users that were deleted previously.

注意
       The lastlog file is a database which contains info on the last login of
       each user. You should not rotate it. It is a sparse file, so its size
       on the disk is usually much smaller than the one shown by "ls -l"
       (which can indicate a really big file if you have in passwd users with
       a high UID). You can display its real size with "ls -s".

配置文件
       The following configuration variables in /etc/login.defs change the
       behavior of this tool:

文件
       /var/log/lastlog
           Database times of previous user logins.

CAVEATS
       Large gaps in UID numbers will cause the lastlog program to run longer
       with no output to the screen (i.e. if in lastlog database there is no
       entries for users with UID between 170 and 800 lastlog will appear to
       hang as it processes entries with UIDs 171-799).

       Having high UIDs can create problems when handling the <term>
       /var/log/lastlog</term> with external tools. Although the actual file
       is sparse and does not use too much space, certain applications are not
       designed to identify sparse files by default and may require a specific
       option to handle them.
