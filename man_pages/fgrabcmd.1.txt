NAME

fgrabcmd, fgrab
− download files from the FSP database

SYNOPSIS

fgrabcmd
[-[f|o]|u|t|n|a|c|r|p] 
fgrabcmd [-[f|o]|u|t|n|a|c|r|p] filename ...

fgrab
[-[f|o]|u|t|n|a|c|r|p] 
fgrab [-[f|o]|u|t|n|a|c|r|p] filename ...

DESCRIPTION

When used
without arguments, a list of file names is read from the
standard input. When arguments are given, the arguments are
taken to be the list of file names. For each file named in
the list, fgrabcmd copies the file to the
client’s current working directory in the client
machine, and deletes it from the FSP database. It is
guaranteed that multiple concurrent grab actions appear to
be mutually exclusive. fgrabcmd will perform
csh file name globbing based on file and directory
information obtained from the FSP database.

Since
user’s command shells generally cannot do the proper
globbing for this program, it is recommended that user
defines a shell alias or function to turn off command shell
globbing before running this program. csh
example:

alias fgrab
\(set noglob\; exec fgrabcmd \!\*\)

ARGUMENTS

-p --
preserve date/times of original file.

-f | -o
-- forces overwriting of files during an fgrab.

-u --
forces unique filenames (appends a unique integer to each
copy)

-t --
forces overwrite of local file if download is successful.
This has the drawback of possibly leaving behind temporary
files with names like .fsp.####

-n --
forces fgrabcmd to refuse to overwrite files with
identical names.

-a | -c
-- forces fgrabcmd to try and append data to a
partial file.

-r --
forces fgetcmd to recursively get all files in given
directories.

The default
mode is for fgrabcmd is to create unique file
names.

ENVIRONMENT

See fsp_env(7)
for list of used environment variables.

BUGS

If fgrab
is interrupted, the file being copied is deleted
nonetheless.
