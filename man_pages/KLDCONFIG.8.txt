KLDCONFIG(8) BSD System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
KLDCONFIG(8)

NAME

kldconfig &mdash; display
or modify the kernel module search path

SYNOPSIS

kldconfig
[&minus;dfimnUv] [&minus;S name]
[path ...] 
kldconfig &minus;r

DESCRIPTION

The kldconfig utility
displays or modifies the search path used by the kernel when
loading modules using the kldload(8) utility or the
kldload(2) syscall.

The following
options are available:

&minus;d

Remove the
specified paths from the module search path.

&minus;f

Do not display
a diagnostic message if a path specified for adding is
already present in the search path, or if a path specified
for removing is not present in the search path. This may be
useful in startup/shutdown scripts for adding a path to a
file system which is still not mounted, or in shutdown
scripts for unconditionally removing a path that may have
been added during startup.

&minus;i

Add the
specified paths to the beginning of the search path, not to
the end. This option can only be used when adding paths.

&minus;m

Instead of
replacing the module search path with the set of paths
specified, &rsquo;&rsquo;merge&rsquo;&rsquo; in the new
entries.

&minus;n

Do not actually
change the module search path.

&minus;r

Display the
current search path. This option cannot be used if any paths
are also specified.

&minus;S name

Specify the sysctl name to use
instead of the default kern.module_path.

&minus;U

&rsquo;&rsquo;Unique-ify&rsquo;&rsquo;
the current search path - if any of the directories is
repeated one or more times, only the first occurrence
remains. This option implies &minus;m.

&minus;v

Verbose output:
display the new module search path. If the path has been
changed, and the &minus;v flag is specified more than
once, the old path is displayed as well.

FILES 
/boot/kernel, /boot/modules, /modules

The default module search path
used by the kernel.

DIAGNOSTICS

The kldconfig utility
exits with a status of 0 on success and with a nonzero
status if an error occurs.
