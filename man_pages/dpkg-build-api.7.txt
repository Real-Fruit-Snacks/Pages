NAME
       dpkg-build-api - source package dpkg build API level

SYNOPSIS
        Build-Depends:
         dpkg-build-api (= 1),

DESCRIPTION
       The source package dpkg build API level, defines a versioned interface
       for source packages, where each API level provides specific behaviors
       and guarantees.

       These interfaces can then be adopted by packages in a gradual way, and
       phased out more easily than with global behavior changes.

       The declaration of this API level is done through build-dependencies,
       in one of Build-Depends, Build-Depends-Indep or Build-Depends-Arch, or
       via the environment variable DPKG_BUILD_API, which will override these
       if both are present, and might emit a warning in case they are
       different.

API LEVELS
       v2  This level is still under development, and cannot be declared via
           build-dependencies.

       v1  This is the recommended level.  Since dpkg 1.22.0.

           Changes from v0 are:

           •   dpkg-shlibdeps no longer uses the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment
               variable.  The -l option should be used instead.

           •   dpkg-buildpackage defaults to Rules-Requires-Root to no.  To
               restore the v0 behavior Rules-Requires-Root should be set to
               binary-targets.

           •   dpkg-buildpackage requires all required debian/rules targets.
               That is clean, build, build-indep, build-arch, binary-indep and
               binary-arch.

           •   vendor.mk defaults to using dpkg_vendor_derives_from_v1 for the
               dpkg_vendor_derives_from macro.  To restore the v0 behavior set
               dpkg_vendor_derives_from to dpkg_vendor_derives_from_v0.

           •   default.mk defaults to including buildtools.mk.

       v0  This is the current global level, equivalent to not specifying one.
           The interfaces and behaviors provided are subject to the normal
           global interface updates, which tend to require longer deprecation
           cycles and/or coordinated transitions.
