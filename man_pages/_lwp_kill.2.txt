NAME

_lwp_kill
&minus; send a signal to a LWP

SYNOPSIS

#include

#include 

int
_lwp_kill(lwpid_t target_lwp, int
sig);

DESCRIPTION

The
_lwp_kill() function sends a signal to the LWP
specified by target_lwp. The signal that is to be
sent is specified by sig and must be one from the
list given in signal(3HEAD). If sig is 0 (the
null signal), error checking is performed but no signal is
actually sent. This can be used to check the validity of
target_lwp.

The
target_lwp must be an LWP within the same process as
the calling LWP.

RETURN VALUES

Upon successful
completion, 0 is returned. A non-zero value indicates
an error.

ERRORS

If any of the
following conditions occur, _lwp_kill() fails and
returns the corresponding value: 
EINVAL

The sig argument is not
a valid signal number.

ESRCH

The target_lwp argument cannot be found in the
current process.
