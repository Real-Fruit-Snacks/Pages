SYNOPSIS

droplang
[ connection-option... ] langname [
dbname ]

droplang
[ connection-option... ] --list | -l
dbname

DESCRIPTION

droplang
is a utility for removing an existing programming language
from a PostgreSQL database. droplang can drop any
procedural language, even those not supplied by the
PostgreSQL distribution.

Although
backend programming languages can be removed directly using
several SQL commands, it is recommended to use
droplang because it performs a number of checks and
is much easier to use. See DROP LANGUAGE
[drop_language(7)] for more.

OPTIONS

droplang
accepts the following command line arguments: 
langname

Specifies the name of the
backend programming language to be removed.

[-d] dbname

[--dbname] dbname

Specifies from which database
the language should be removed. The default is to use the
database with the same name as the current system user.

-e

--echo

Display SQL commands as they are executed.

-l

--list

Show a list of already installed languages in the target
database. 

droplang
also accepts the following command line arguments for
connection parameters: 
-h host 
--host host

Specifies the host name of the
machine on which the server is running. If host begins with
a slash, it is used as the directory for the Unix domain
socket.

-p port 
--port port

Specifies the Internet TCP/IP
port or local Unix domain socket file extension on which the
server is listening for connections.

-U username

--username username

User name to connect as

-W

--password

Force password prompt.

ENVIRONMENT

PGDATABASE

PGHOST

PGPORT

PGUSER

Default connection parameters

DIAGNOSTICS

Most error
messages are self-explanatory. If not, run droplang
with the --echo option and see under the respective
SQL command for details.

NOTES

Use
createlang(1) to add a language.

EXAMPLES

To remove the
language pltcl:

$ droplang
pltcl dbname
