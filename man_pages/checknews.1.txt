NAME

checknews
&minus; check for unread news

SYNOPSIS

checknews

DESCRIPTION

Checknews
informs the user whether he has unread news. It is suitable
for running from a .profile (or .login if you
use a certain non-standard shell) file.

Checknews
normally runs readnews(1) with the &minus;c
option. As a heuristic concession to practicality, if the
user has a .rnlast file in his $HOME directory,
checknews runs rn &minus;c &minus;s3
instead.
