DESCRIPTION

These routines
are useful for mapping 48 bit Ethernet numbers to their
ASCII representations or their corresponding host names, and
vice versa.

The function
ether_ntoa() converts a 48 bit Ethernet number
pointed to by e to its standard ASCII
representation; it returns a pointer to the ASCII
string. The representation is of the form
x:x:x: x:x:x where
x is a hexadecimal number between 0 and
ff. The function ether_aton() converts an
ASCII string in the standard representation back to a
48 bit Ethernet number; the function returns NULL if
the string cannot be scanned successfully.

The function
ether_ntohost() maps an Ethernet number (pointed to
by e) to its associated hostname. The string pointed
to by hostname must be long enough to hold the hostname and
a NULL character. The function returns zero upon
success and non-zero upon failure. Inversely, the function
ether_hostton() maps a hostname string to its
corresponding Ethernet number; the function modifies the
Ethernet number pointed to by e. The function also
returns zero upon success and non-zero upon failure. In
order to do the mapping, both these functions may lookup one
or more of the following sources: the ethers file, the
NIS maps ’’ethers.byname’’
and ’’ethers.byaddr’’ and the
NIS+ table ’’ethers’’. The
sources and their lookup order are specified in the
/etc/nsswitch.conf file (see nsswitch.conf(4)
for details).

The function
ether_line() scans a line (pointed to by l)
and sets the hostname and the Ethernet number (pointed to by
e). The string pointed to by hostname must be long
enough to hold the hostname and a NULL character. The
function returns zero upon success and non-zero upon
failure. The format of the scanned line is described by
ethers(4).

BUGS

Programs that
call ether_hostton() or ether_ntohost()
routines cannot be linked statically since the
implementation of these routines requires dynamic linker
functionality to access shared objects at run time.
