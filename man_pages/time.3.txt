NAME

time - time
functions for gawk

SYNOPSIS

@load
"time"

time =
gettimeofday() 
ret = sleep(amount)

CAUTION

This extension
is deprecated in favor of the timex extension in the
gawkextlib project. Loading it issues a warning. It
will be removed from the gawk distribution in the
next major release.

DESCRIPTION

The time
extension adds two functions named gettimeofday() and
sleep(), as follows. 
gettimeofday()

This function returns the
number of seconds since the Epoch as a floating-point value.
It should have subsecond precision. It returns -1 upon error
and sets ERRNO to indicate the problem.

sleep(seconds)

This function attempts to sleep
for the given amount of seconds, which may include a
fractional portion. If seconds is negative, or the
attempt to sleep fails, then it returns -1 and sets
ERRNO. Otherwise, the function should return 0 after
sleeping for the indicated amount of time.

EXAMPLE

@load
"time" 
... 
printf "It is now %g seconds since the Epoch\n",
gettimeofday() 
printf "Pausing for a while... " ; sleep(2.5) ;
print "done"
