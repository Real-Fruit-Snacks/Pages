NAME

de &mdash; DEC DC21x4x
Ethernet device driver

SYNOPSIS

To compile this driver into the
kernel, place the following line in your kernel
configuration file:

device
de

Alternatively,
to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following line in loader.conf(5):

if_de_load="YES"

DEPRECATION NOTICE

The de driver is not
present in FreeBSD 13.0 and later. See
https://github.com/freebsd/fcp/blob/master/fcp-0101.md for
more information.

DESCRIPTION

The de driver provides
support for the Ethernet adapters based on the Digital
Equipment DC21x4x based self-contained Ethernet and Fast
Ethernet chips.

The de
driver supports the following media types:

autoselect

Enable
autoselection of the media type and options

10baseT/UTP

Set 10Mbps
operation on the 10baseT port

10base2/BNC

Set 10Mbps
operation on the BNC port

10base5/AUI

Set 10Mbps
operation on the AUI port

100baseTX

Set 100Mbps
(Fast Ethernet) operation

100baseFX

Set 100Mbps
operation

100baseT4

Set 100Mbps
operation (4-pair cat-3 cable)

The de
driver supports the following media options:

full-duplex

Set full duplex
operation

Note that the
media types available depend on the particular card in use.
Some cards are explicitly programmed to a particular media
type by a setup utility and are not changeable.

Use the
ifconfig(8) command and in particular the &minus;m
flag to list the supported media types for your particular
card.

The old
&rsquo;&rsquo;ifconfig linkN&rsquo;&rsquo; method of
configuration is not supported.

DIAGNOSTICS

de%d: waking device from
sleep/snooze mode  The 21041 and 21140A chips
support suspending the operation of the card.

de%d: error:
desired IRQ of %d does not match device&rsquo;s actual IRQ
of %d  The device probe detected that the board is
configured for a different interrupt than the one specified
in the kernel configuration file.

de%d: not
configured; limit of %d reached or exceeded  There
is a limit of 32 de devices allowed in a single
machine.

de%d: not
configured; 21040 pass 2.0 required (%d.%d found)  
de%d: not configured; 21140 pass 1.1 required (%d.%d
found)  Certain revisions of the chipset are not
supported by this driver.
