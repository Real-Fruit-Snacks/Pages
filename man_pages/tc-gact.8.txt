NAME
       gact - generic action

SYNOPSIS
       tc ... action gact CONTROL [ RAND ] [ INDEX ]
       CONTROL := { reclassify | drop | continue | pass | pipe |
               goto chain CHAIN_INDEX |
               jump JUMP_COUNT }

       RAND := random RANDTYPE CONTROL VAL
       RANDTYPE := { netrand | determ }
       VAL := number not exceeding 10000
       JUMP_COUNT := absolute jump from start of action list
       INDEX := index value used

DESCRIPTION
       The  gact  action  allows  reclassify,  dropping, passing, or accepting
       packets.  At the moment there are only two algorithms. One is determin‐
       istic and the other uses internal kernel netrand.

OPTIONS
       random RANDTYPE CONTROL VAL
              The probability of taking the action expressed in terms of 1 out
              of VAL packets.

       CONTROL
              Indicate how tc should proceed if the packet matches.  For a de‐
              scription of the possible CONTROL values, see tc-actions(8).

EXAMPLES
       Apply a rule on ingress to drop packets from a given source address.
              # tc filter add dev eth0 parent ffff: protocol ip prio 6 u32 match ip src 10.0.0.9/32 flowid 1:16 action drop

       Allow 1 out 10 packets from source randomly using the netrand generator
              # tc filter add dev eth0 parent ffff: protocol ip prio 6 u32 match ip src 10.0.0.9/32 flowid 1:16 action drop random netrand ok 10

       Deterministically accept every second packet
              # tc filter add dev eth0 parent ffff: protocol ip prio 6 u32 match ip src 10.0.0.9/32 flowid 1:16 action drop random determ ok 2
