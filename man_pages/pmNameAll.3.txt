NAME

pmNameAll
- translate a PMID to a set of performance metric names

C SYNOPSIS

#include

int
pmNameAll(pmID pmid, char
***nameset);

cc ...
-lpcp

DESCRIPTION

Given a
Performance Metric Identifier (PMID) via pmid,
pmNameAll will determine all the corresponding metric
names, if any, in the Performance Metrics Name Space (PMNS),
and return these via nameset.

The resulting
list of pointers nameset and the values (the
relative names) that the pointers reference will have been
allocated by pmNameAll with a single call to
malloc(3), and it is the responsibility of the
pmNameAll caller to use free(nameset) to
release the space when it is no longer required.

In the absence
of errors, pmNameAll returns the number of names in
nameset.

For many
examples of a PMNS, there will be a 1:1 mapping between a
name and a PMID, and under these circumstances,
pmNameID(3) provides a slightly simpler interface in
the absence of duplicate names for a particular PMID.

DIAGNOSTICS

PM_ERR_NOPMNS

Failed to access a PMNS for
operation. Note that if the application hasn&rsquo;t a
priori called pmLoadNameSpace(3) and wants to use the
distributed PMNS, then a call to pmNameAll must be
made after the creation of a context (see
pmNewContext(3)).

PM_ERR_PMID

pmid does not correspond
to a defined PMID in the PMNS.

PM_ERR_*

Other diagnostics are for
protocol failures when accessing the distributed PMNS.
