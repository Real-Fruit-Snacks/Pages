SYNOPSIS

crack_testlib

crack_testnum

crack_teststr

DESCRIPTION

crack_testlib
tests if the input string will be accepted as a valid
password by the installed cracklib dictionary using the
FascistCheck(3) subroutine. crack_testnum
tests if the input integer is an index to a word in the
installed cracklib dictionary and returns the word if found.
crack_teststr tests if the input string is in the
installed cracklib dictionary and returns its index number
if found.

The database is
in a binary format generated by the utilities
crack_mkdict(8) and crack_packer(8). On a
Debian system the database is located in the directory
/var/cache/cracklib/cracklib_dict and is generated daily
with the program update-cracklib (8), which is called
from the cron job /etc/cron.daily/cracklib crack.h
using the constant CRACKLIB_DICTPATH though none of
the subroutines in the cracklib libraries have this location
hardcoded into their implementations.

Each take one
string or number per line. Enter ^C when done.
