NAME

sq pki link
retract - Retract links

SYNOPSIS

sq pki link
retract [OPTIONS] FINGERPRINT|KEYID
USERID|EMAIL

DESCRIPTION

Retract
links.

This command
retracts links that were previously created using ’sq
pki link add’. See that subcommand’s
documentation for more details. Note: this is called
’retract’ and not ’remove’, because
the certifications are not removed. Instead a new
certification is added, which says that the binding has not
been authenticated.

’sq pki
link retract’ respects the reference time set by the
top-level ’--time’ argument. This causes a link
to be retracted as of a particular time instead of the
current time.

OPTIONS

Subcommand
options 
--email=email

An email address to unlink from
the certificate. The email address must match a User ID with
the email, although, it need not be linked.

--notation NAME
VALUE

Add a notation to the
certification. A user-defined notation’s name must be
of the form ’name [AT] a.org’. If
the notation’s name starts with a !, then the notation
is marked as being critical. If a consumer of a signature
doesn’t understand a critical notation, then it will
ignore the signature. The notation is marked as being human
readable.

--userid=USERID

A User ID to unlink from the
certificate. This must match a known User ID, although it
need not be linked.

FINGERPRINT|KEYID

The certificate whose
acceptance is being retracted.

USERID|EMAIL

A User ID or email address to
unlink from the certificate. This must match a known User
ID. Scripts should prefer to use ’--email’ or
’--userid’, as ’sq’ does not need to
guess if a value is a User ID or an email address. If no
User IDs, or email addresses are provided, then all known
User IDs are unlinked.

Global
options
