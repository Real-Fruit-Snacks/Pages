NAME

kubectl logs -
Print the logs for a container in a pod

SYNOPSIS

kubectl
logs [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION

has only one container, the container name is optional.

OPTIONS

--ignore-errors=false

If watching / following pod logs, allow for any errors
that occur to be non-fatal

--insecure-skip-tls-verify-backend=false

limit.

--prefix=false

container name)

-p, --previous=false

If true, print the logs for the previous instance of the
container in a pod if it exists.

-l, --selector=""

Only return logs newer than a relative duration like 5s,
2m, or 3h. Defaults to all logs. Only one of since-time /

--since-time=""

Only return logs after a specific date (RFC3339).
Defaults to all logs. Only one of since-time / since may be
used. 

--tail=-1

Lines of recent log file to display. Defaults to -1 with
no selector, showing all log lines otherwise 10, if a
selector is provided.
