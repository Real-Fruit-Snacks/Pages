ceph-osd - ceph
object storage daemon

SYNOPSIS

ceph-osd
-i osdnum [ --osd-data datapath ] [
--osd-journal 
journal ] [ --mkfs ] [ --mkjournal ] [--flush-journal]
[--check-allows-journal] [--check-wants-journal]
[--check-needs-journal] [ --mkkey ] [ --osdspec-affinity
]

DESCRIPTION

ceph-osd
is the object storage daemon for the Ceph distributed file
system. It is responsible for storing objects on a local
file system and providing access to them over the
network.

The datapath
argument should be a directory on a xfs file system where
the object data resides. The journal is optional, and is
only useful performance-wise when it resides on a different
disk than datapath with low latency (ideally, an NVRAM
device).

OPTIONS

-f,
--foreground

Foreground: do not daemonize
after startup (run in foreground). Do not generate a pid
file. Useful when run via ceph-run(8).

-d

Debug mode: like -f, but also send all log output
to stderr.

--setuser userorgid

Set uid after starting. If a
username is specified, the user record is looked up to get a
uid and a gid, and the gid is also set as well, unless
--setgroup is also specified.

--setgroup
grouporgid

Set gid after starting. If a
group name is specified the group record is looked up to get
a gid.

--osd-data osddata

Use object store at
osddata.

--osd-journal
journal

Journal updates to
journal.

--check-wants-journal

Check whether a journal is
desired.

--check-allows-journal

Check whether a journal is
allowed.

--check-needs-journal

Check whether a journal is
required.

--mkfs

Create an empty object repository. This also initializes
the journal (if one is defined).

--mkkey

Generate a new secret key. This
is normally used in combination with --mkfs as it is
more convenient than generating a key by hand with
ceph-authtool(8).

--mkjournal

Create a new journal file to
match an existing object repository. This is useful if the
journal device or file is wiped out due to a disk or file
system failure.

--flush-journal

Flush the journal to permanent
store. This runs in the foreground so you know when it's
completed. This can be useful if you want to resize the
journal or need to otherwise destroy it: this guarantees you
won't lose data.

--get-cluster-fsid

Print the cluster fsid (uuid)
and exit.

--get-osd-fsid

Print the OSD's fsid and exit.
The OSD's uuid is generated at --mkfs time and is thus
unique to a particular instantiation of this OSD.

--get-journal-fsid

Print the journal's uuid. The
journal fsid is set to match the OSD fsid at --mkfs
time.

-c ceph.conf,
--conf=ceph.conf

Use ceph.conf
configuration file instead of the default
/etc/ceph/ceph.conf for runtime configuration
options.

-m monaddress[:port]

Connect to specified monitor
(instead of looking through ceph.conf).

--osdspec-affinity

Set an affinity to a certain
OSDSpec. This option can only be used in conjunction with
--mkfs.

AVAILABILITY

ceph-osd
is part of Ceph, a massively scalable, open-source,
distributed storage system. Please refer to the Ceph
documentation at http://ceph.com/docs for more
information.
