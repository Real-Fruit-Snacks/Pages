NAME

START
TRANSACTION &minus; start a transaction block

SYNOPSIS

START
TRANSACTION [ ISOLATION LEVEL { READ COMMITTED |
SERIALIZABLE } ] [ READ WRITE | READ ONLY ]

DESCRIPTION

This command
begins a new transaction. If the isolation level or
read/write mode is specified, the new transaction has those
characteristics, as if SET TRANSACTION
[set_transaction(7)] was executed. In all other
respects, the behavior of this command is identical to the
BEGIN [begin(7)] command.

PARAMETERS

See under SET
TRANSACTION [set_transaction(7)] about the meaning of
the parameters.

COMPATIBILITY

This command
conforms to the SQL standard; but see also the compatibility
section of SET TRANSACTION [set_transaction(7)].
