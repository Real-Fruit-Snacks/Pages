NAME

lptcontrol &mdash; a
utility for manipulating the lpt printer driver

SYNOPSIS

lptcontrol &minus;i |
&minus;p | &minus;e | &minus;s
[&minus;d device]

DESCRIPTION

The lptcontrol utility is
used to set either the interrupt-driven, extended or polling
mode of individual lpt(4) devices. When a printer is
switched from a mode to another, this change will only take
effect the next time the device is opened.

Extended mode is
anything the parallel port interface can support. For an
ECP/ISA parallel port, it may be FIFO+DMA or ECP.

The following
command line options are supported:

&minus;i

Turn on
interrupt-driven mode.

&minus;p

Turn on polled
mode.

&minus;e

Turn on
extended mode.

&minus;s

Turn on
standard mode, i.e., turn off extended mode.

&minus;d
device

Set the mode of the printer
device specified by device. The default value for
device is /dev/lpt0.

One of
&minus;i, &minus;p or &minus;e must be
specified.
