NAME

oz-install -
tool to automatically install operating systems into
files

SYNOPSIS

oz-install
[OPTIONS] 

DESCRIPTION

This is a tool
to automatically install operating system into files that
represent disk images. The input is an XML file representing
the operating system and packages to be installed. By
default (and by design), the first stage of the install only
installs a JEOS (Just Enough Operating System);
customization, including the installation of additional
packages can also be done, but requires additional
flags.

Note that
oz-install does the actual installation using a combination
of KVM and libvirt, so both of these must be available (and
working) for oz-install to have a chance to succeed.

OPTIONS

-a

Use the user-provided auto
installation file auto. By default, Oz will use a
hard-coded auto-installation file (kickstart, preseed, sif,
etc) to do a basic OS installation. Using this option, the
user can provide an alternate auto-installation file to do
the install. The caveat is that user-provided
auto-installation files are more likely to cause
installation errors, so this option should be used with
caution.

-b 

Use disk_bus for the
storage device while doing the install. By default, Oz has
built-in knowledge of the appropriate disk bus to use while
installing each guest operating system (ide or virtio). This
option allows the user to override that default with their
own choice.

-c 

Get the configuration from
config file config, instead of the default
/etc/oz/oz.cfg. If neither one exists, Oz will use sensible
defaults. The config file is in standard ini format; for an
explanation of the sections and keys, see the
CONFIGURATION FILE section.

-d 

Turn on debugging output to
level loglevel. The log levels are: 
0 - errors only (this is the default) 
1 - errors and warnings 
2 - errors, warnings, and information 
3 - all messages 
4 - all messages, prepended with the level and classname

-f

Force the generation of new installation media. By
default, oz-install will always try to use a locally cached
version of the oz-modified install media if it is available.
Failing that, oz-install will try to use a locally cached
version of the pristine install media if it is available.
You can use this flag to force it to always download and
regenerate the oz-modified install media, even if it has a
local version available.

-g

Generate the ICICLE (a package manifest, with some
additional metadata) after the installation is complete.

-h

Print a short help message.

-i 

If oz-install has been
instructed to generate an ICICLE (see the -g option), then
it will normally write the ICICLE XML to stdout. To have
oz-install write the ICICLE to a file instead, use the -i
option. Note that it is an error to specify -i without
-g.

-m

Use mac_address for the
network device while doing the install. The default value is
autogenerated by Oz. This option allows the user to override
this behaviour.

-n

Use network_device for
the network device while doing the install. By default, Oz
has built-in knowledge of the appropriate network device to
use while installing each guest operating system (ne2k_pci,
rtl8139, virtio). This option allows the user to override
that default with their own choice.

-p

Cleanup old guests before installation. By default, if a
guest with the same libvirt UUID, libvirt name, or diskimage
exists prior to Oz starting installation, Oz will abort. If
this option is used, then Oz will undefine the libvirt guest
with the same name or UUID and delete the diskimage, so it
should be used with caution.

-s 

Write the disk image to
disk, rather than the default of the TDL name.

-t 

Terminate the installation of
the guest in timeout seconds rather than the oz
default. This value should be increased if running on slow
storage or running multiple oz-install operations on the
same machine.

Please note
that there is a separate termination action that occurs if
300 seconds elapses with no disk activity to the operating
system. This timer value is not configurable.

-u

Customize the image after installation. This generally
installs additional packages onto the disk image after
installation. 

-x 

Oz will normally generate a
libvirt XML file in the current working directory suffixed
with the date and time. Specifying the -x option allows the
filename to be overridden.

CONFIGURATION FILE

The Oz
configuration file is in standard INI format with several
sections. If any section or configuration key is missing, Oz
will use a sensible default. For true/false configuration
keys, the values of "true", "True",
"yes", or "Yes" can be used to turn the
option on, and "false", "False",
"no", or "No" can be used to turn the
behavior off. The configuration file should have the
following form:

[paths] 
output_dir = /var/lib/libvirt/images 
data_dir = /var/lib/oz 
screenshot_dir = . 
sshprivkey = /etc/oz/id_rsa-icicle-gen

[libvirt] 
uri = qemu:///system 
type = kvm 
bridge_name = virbr0 
cpus = 1 
memory = 1024 
image_type = raw

[cache] 
original_media = yes 
modified_media = no 
jeos = no

[icicle] 
safe_generation = no

The
paths section defines the paths that Oz will use for
storing data. The output_dir key describes where to
store the images after they are built, and the
data_dir key describes where to cache install media
and use temporary storage. Both locations must have a decent
amount of free disk space in order for Oz to work properly.
The screenshot_dir key describes where to store
screenshots of failed installs. The sshprivkey key
describes where the ssh keys are stored, which are required
by Oz to do customization of the image.

The
libvirt section allows some manipulation of how Oz
uses libvirt. The uri key describes the libvirt URI
to use to do the guest installation. The type key
defines what type of virtualization to use. The
bridge_name key defines which bridge Oz should place
the guests that it launches on. The cpus key defines
how many cpus should be used inside the virtual machine. The
memory key defines how much memory (in megabytes)
should be used inside the virtual machine. The
image_type key defines which output disk type should
be used; this can be any value that libvirt supports.

The
cache section allows some manipulation of how Oz
caches data. The caching of data in Oz is a tradeoff between
installation time and storage space. The
original_media key tells Oz to cache the original
installation media so that it does not have to download it
the next time an install for the same operating system is
requested. The modified_media key tells Oz to cache
the oz-modified installation media so that it does not have
to download and modify it the next time an install for the
same operating system is requested. The jeos key
tells Oz to cache the installed operating system after
installation. This can significantly speed up subsequent
installation of the same operating system, with the
additional downside of the operating system getting
out-of-date with respect to security updates. Use with
care.

The
icicle section allows some manipulation of how Oz
generates ICICLE output. ICICLE is a package manifest that
can optionally be generated at the end of installs. The
safe_generation key controls whether Oz uses a
throwaway overlay file while generating the ICICLE. If it is
set to "no" (the default), then Oz will boot up
the guest at the end of the install and run the appropriate
commands to generate the ICICLE. If it is set to
"yes", then Oz will use a throwaway overlay file
while generating the ICICLE. After the ICICLE is generated,
Oz will delete the backing file, leaving the original disk
image pristine.
