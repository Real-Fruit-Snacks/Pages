NAME

renice &mdash; alter
priority of running processes

SYNOPSIS

renice priority
[

[&minus;p] pid ... ] [ 
[&minus;g] pgrp ... ] [ 
[&minus;u] user ... ]

DESCRIPTION

renice alters the
scheduling priority of one or more running processes. The
following who parameters are interpreted as process
ID&rsquo;s, process group ID&rsquo;s, or user names.
&rsquo;ing a process group causes all processes in the
process group to have their scheduling priority altered.
&rsquo;ing a user causes all processes owned by the user to
have their scheduling priority altered. By default, the
processes to be affected are specified by their process
ID&rsquo;s.

Options
supported by :

&minus;g

Force
who parameters to be interpreted as process group
ID&rsquo;s.

&minus;u

Force the
who parameters to be interpreted as user names.

&minus;p

Resets the
who interpretation to be (the default) process
ID&rsquo;s.

For example,

renice +1 987 -u
daemon root -p 32

would change the
priority of process ID&rsquo;s 987 and 32, and all processes
owned by users daemon and root.

Users other than
the super-user may only alter the priority of processes they
own, and can only monotonically increase their
&rsquo;&rsquo;nice value&rsquo;&rsquo; within the range 0 to
PRIO_MAX (20). (This prevents overriding administrative
fiats.) The super-user may alter the priority of any process
and set the priority to any value in the range PRIO_MIN
(&minus;20) to PRIO_MAX. Useful priorities are: 20 (the
affected processes will run only when nothing else in the
system wants to), 0 (the &rsquo;&rsquo;base&rsquo;&rsquo;
scheduling priority), anything negative (to make things go
very fast).

FILES 
/etc/passwd

to map user
names to user ID&rsquo;s

BUGS

Non super-users can not increase
scheduling priorities of their own processes, even if they
were the ones that decreased the priorities in the first
place.
