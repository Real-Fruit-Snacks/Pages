NAME

sendfax -
submit a facsimile job for transmission

SYNOPSIS

sendfax
[ options ] [ files... ]

DESCRIPTION

sendfax
submits one or more facsimile transmission requests to a
Hyla FAX facsimile server. Requests
are normally processed immediately, although they may also
be queued for transmission at a later time using a syntax
identical to the at(1) command. For each job that is
queued, sendfax prints a job identifier and a
job group identifier on the standard output. A job
identifier is the token by which jobs are identified within
Hyla FAX ; job group identifiers are
used to reference a set of jobs that have been submitted at
the same time. Job and job group identifiers can be supplied
to the faxrm(1) command to remove the jobs or to the
faxalter(1) command to alter job parameters.

Facsimile are
made from the concatenation of a cover page (see below) and
one or more files specified on the command line. If no files
are supplied on the command line, sendfax will read
data from the standard input unless polling is requested.
Cover pages are distinguished for the purpose of generating
&rsquo;&rsquo;continuation cover pages&rsquo;&rsquo;
on the server; these are makeup cover pages that are
automatically generated if a job fails after sending the
original user-specified cover page.

sendfax
passes P OST S CRIPT &reg; and
TIFF documents directly through to the fax
server for transmission, and attempts to convert other file
formats to either P OST S
CRIPT or TIFF. In normal
operation sendfax automatically converts
ASCII-text, troff(1) output, Portable
Document Format (PDF), and Silicon Graphics format images
for transmission. Support for other file formats can be
easily added through an extensible file typing and
conversion facility; see typerules(5). Note that
since TIFF Class F documents are processed
directly it is simple to forward a received facsimile.

By default
sendfax will generate a cover page for each facsimile
that is to be transmitted. This cover page is created by the
ancillary faxcover(1) program using information
deduced by sendfax and by information supplied on the
command line. Automatic cover page generation may be
suppressed with the -n option.

In addition to
sending documents, sendfax can be used to poll a
remote facsimile machine to retrieve waiting documents. If
the -p option is specified, a polling request will be
submitted to each destination. If a poll request is made in
conjunction with the transmission of documents, the poll
request will take place after the documents are transmitted.
Documents retrieved by polling are returned to the requestor
by electronic mail and may be viewed with a suitable viewer
program.

One or more
destinations must be specified on the command line using the
-d option. A destination is the dialing string to use
to contact the remote fax machine. Phone numbers may include
non-alphanumeric characters for readability&mdash;only
alphanumerics, &rsquo;&rsquo;+&rsquo;&rsquo; (for denoting a
country code), and &rsquo;&rsquo;#&rsquo;&rsquo; (for
denoting a subaddress) are significant in placing a call.
Alphabetic characters are automatically mapped to their
numeric key equivalents: &rsquo;&rsquo;abcABC&rsquo;&rsquo;
to &rsquo;&rsquo;2&rsquo;&rsquo;,
&rsquo;&rsquo;defDEF&rsquo;&rsquo; to
&rsquo;&rsquo;3&rsquo;&rsquo;, etc. Dialing prefixes, such
as &rsquo;&rsquo;1&rsquo;&rsquo; and
&rsquo;&rsquo;011&rsquo;&rsquo; (for long distance calling
in the United States) need not be included if an unambiguous
number is specified. Examples of unambiguous phone numbers
are:

+31.77.594.131

to call the Netherlands

+14159657824

to call California

9657824

to make a local call

1-215-356-1666

to call Pennsylvania from within the US

Non-numeric strings, such as
&rsquo;&rsquo;*70&rsquo;&rsquo; (to defeat call waiting),
may be included in the destination phone number. Whether or
not they are stripped from the string used to dial the
destination fax machine is dependent on the dialstring rules
configured for use on the server; c.f.
hylafax-config(5) and dialrules(5).

A destination
may also be specified as user@fax-number. In this
case the user string will be passed to
faxcover as the identity of the recipient. Note that
multi-word names must be enclosed in quote marks; for
example, &rsquo;&rsquo;Sam
Leffler@+1.415.555.1212&rsquo;&rsquo;.

The order of
options on the command line is significant. Each fax to be
transmitted is assigned the current value of parameters
specified on the command line; e.g. whether or not to
generate a cover page. This means that options that specify
parameters for a particular destination must precede the
dialstring specified with the -d option. For
example,

sendfax -n -d
5551212 /etc/passwd

submits a fax
to 5551212 that has no cover page while

sendfax -d
5551212 -n /etc/passwd

submits the
same fax but with the default cover page handling. Note also
that parameter values persist across -d options so
the following

sendfax -n -d
5551212 -d 5551313 /etc/network

submits two
facsimile, both of which have no cover page.

OPTIONS

-1

Transmit facsimile documents
using 1-D MH compression. By default Hyla
FAX will use the optimal compression
scheme supported by the transmitting modem and receiving
facsimile device.

-2

Transmit facsimile documents using 2-D MR compression,
if possible. By default Hyla FAX will
use the optimal compression scheme supported by the
transmitting modem and receiving facsimile device.

-3

Transmit facsimile documents using 2-D MMR compression,
if possible. By default Hyla FAX will
use the optimal compression scheme supported by the
transmitting modem and receiving facsimile device.

-a time

Schedule transmission up to one year in advance at the
indicated time. Time is specified in the
format: &rsquo;&rsquo;HH:MM [AM|PM] | now [+ N period
| month DD | dayofweek ]&acute;&acute; where
month can be Jan(uary), Feb(ruary), Mar(ch), Apr(il),
May, Jun(e), Jul(y), Aug(ust), Sep(tember), Oct(ober),
Nov(ember), or Dec(ember); period can be minute(s),
hour(s), day(s), week(s), or month(s); dayofweek can
be Mon(day), Tue(sday), Wed(nesday), Thu(rsday), Fri(day),
Sat(urday), Sun(day); e.g. &rsquo;&rsquo;now + 30
minutes&acute;&acute; to schedule transmission 30 minutes in
the future. Trailing information in the time field
(such as YYYY) is ignored. By default, sendfax
schedules facsimile for immediate delivery. Time should be
given in the user&rsquo;s local time.

-A

Archive the job on the server according to the
bin/archive script when the job is done.

-b speed

Transmit facsimile documents using a signalling rate
that is constrained to be at least speed bits/second.
If the specified speed is greater than the transmitting
modem or receiver is capable of, it is reduced to the
highest possible speed both devices support. If a negotiated
signalling rate greater than or equal to speed cannot
be negotiated then the job is aborted. Possible speeds are:
2400, 4800, 7200, 9600, 12000, 14400, 16800, 19200, 21600,
24000, 26400, 28800, 31200, and 33600. By default Hyla
FAX will use the fastest possible rate
supported by the transmitting modem and receiving facsimile
device. 

-B speed

Try to transmit facsimile documents using the desired
signalling rate. Possible speeds are: 2400, 4800, 7200,
9600, 12000, 14400, 16800, 19200, 21600, 24000, 26400,
28800, 31200, and 33600. If the specified speed is greater
than the transmitting modem or receiver is capable of, it is
reduced to the highest possible speed both devices support.
By default Hyla FAX will use the
fastest possible rate supported by the transmitting modem
and receiving facsimile device (unless restricted by other
server configuration); this option can be used to reduce the
speed. Note that international calls are frequently more
reliable when transmissions are restricted to 9600
bits/second. For Class 1/1.0 devices, if the specified speed
is not greater than 14400 then V.34 will not be attempted,
and if the specified speed is 9600 or 7200 then V.29 will be
assumed in lieu of V.17.

-c comments

Pass comments to the faxcover(1) program
for inclusion in the comments field of any generated cover
page. 

-C file

Pass file to the faxcover(1) program for
use as the cover page template.

-D

Enable notification by electronic mail when the
facsimile has been delivered. By default Hyla
FAX will notify the submitter only if
there is a problem with a job.

-d
destination

Create a job to transmit the
supplied documents to a facsimile machine at the indicated
destination. If the destination is of the form
&rsquo;&rsquo;user@phone-number#subaddress&rsquo;&rsquo;
then any cover page will show user as the intended
recipient, and the remote system will be supplied the
subaddress value (i.e. for routing) provided that the
sending modem and the receiving system support it.

-E

Disable use of the Error Correction Mode (
ECM ) when transmitting page data. Setting
ECM to false will limit the maximum speed to
14400 bps. By default Hyla FAX will
attempt to use ECM when both the transmitting
modem and receiving device support it. Note that
international calls are sometimes faster when
ECM is disabled. Beware also that some modems
and/or facsimile devices do not properly implement
ECM causing transmission failures.

-f from

Use from as the identity of the facsimile sender.
Otherwise the sender is the user that invoked
sendfax. The sender is an account name to which the
Hyla FAX software should direct
notification messages. The from identity may be a
fullblown &rsquo;&rsquo;From:&rsquo;&rsquo; line, e.g. e.g.
&rsquo;&rsquo;Joe Blow joe [AT] foo.com>&rsquo;&rsquo; and
&rsquo;&rsquo;joe [AT] foo.com (Joe Blow)&rsquo;&rsquo; are
acceptable. If no host-part is specified in the from
string the local hostname is used. This option is useful
when sendfax is invoked on behalf of another user,
such as in the implementation of an electronic mail to fax
gateway. 

-F format

Use the specified format when imaging tag lines
on outgoing pages. Consult the description of the
TagLineFormat parameter in hylafax-config(5)
for an explanation of how to construct a format string.

Note that
many locales require that proper identification appear on
all transmitted facsimile; when using this facility one
should always include proper identification (e.g. a phone
number) in the imaged taglines.

-G

Enable usage of any extended
resolutions supported by the receiver. -G supersedes
the usage of any -l or -m options. Beware that
increased resolution will increase transmission time.

-h
[modem@]host[:port]

Force the jobs to be processed
on a specific host and, optionally, using a
particular modem. The host may be either a
symbolic name or a network address. If no -h option
is supplied, sendfax uses the
FAXSERVER environment variable to identify
the Hyla FAX server to which the jobs
should be directed. If no server is specified then
sendfax attempts to contact a server on the local
host. If no modem is specified, the job will be submitted to
any available modem.

-i identifier

Use the identifier
string in any notification messages instead of the usual job
identifier number. This option is useful for applications
that cross reference notification messages against job
submissions.

-I time

If a job must be requeued because of a communication
failure schedule the retry according to the specified
time. Times are given in seconds. Minutes, hours, and
days can be specified with
&rsquo;&rsquo;min&rsquo;&rsquo;,
&rsquo;&rsquo;hour&rsquo;&rsquo;, and
&rsquo;&rsquo;day&rsquo;&rsquo; suffixes,
respectively. By default Hyla FAX
reschedules jobs using retry times that depend on the manner
in which the job failed; this interface permits a user to
override this algorithm and specify a single fixed retry
time for all communication failures.

-k time

Kill the job if it does not complete in the indicated
time. The time is specified using notation
identical to the -a option. Note that the time
is relative to the time of the initial time-to-send. The
default kill time is &rsquo;&rsquo;now + 3
hours&rsquo;&rsquo; (three hours from the time the job is
first processed). To retry for an hour, &rsquo;&rsquo;now +1
hour&rsquo;&rsquo; could be used.

-l

Transmit the facsimile at a vertical resolution of 98
lines/inch; otherwise known as low resolution.

-m

Transmit the facsimile at a vertical resolution of 196
lines/inch; otherwise known as medium resolution or
fine mode.

-M mst

Transmit facsimile documents using the specified minimum
scanline time. Possible times are: 0ms, 5ms, 10ms2, 10ms,
20ms2, 20ms, 40ms2, and 40ms. If the specified time is less
than the transmitting modem or receiver is capable of, it is
increased to the lowest possible time both devices support.
By default Hyla FAX will use the
lowest possible time supported by the transmitting modem and
receiving facsimile device (unless restricted by other
server configuration). This option is mostly useful for
debugging. 

-n

Suppress the automatic generation of a cover page for
subsequent facsimile. Note that polling requests do not
receive a cover page unless they are combined with the
transmission of one or more files.

-N

Do not notify the sender by electronic mail when the
facsimile has been delivered or requeued.

-o owner

Specify the fax owner login name, replacing any
FAXUSER environment variable that may be set for the
same purpose. If neither is specified, the user&rsquo;s
current login name is used.

-p

Poll each destination for any available documents. If a
poll request is made together with document transmission,
the poll operation is done after the documents are
transmitted. Documents received by polling are returned to
the sender by electronic mail.

-P priority

Assign the specified scheduling priority to
subsequent jobs. A priority is an integer value in the range
[0-255]. Lower values result in higher priority processing.
By default, each job is assigned 127 for an initial
scheduling priority. If a job&rsquo;s priority is greater
than bulk faxes then the job&rsquo;s priority is raised
(numerically lowered) for each failed attempt to transmit so
that retransmit attempts are done ahead of newly submitted
jobs. In the case of bulk faxes (numerically higher than
190), then the job&rsquo;s priority is lowered (numerically
raised) for each failed attempt to transmit so that the
whole of the bulk-queued jobs will be attempted before any
are retried. The priority may also be specified as
one of the following symbolic names: default or
normal (127), bulk or junk (191),
low (190), or high (63).

-R

Enable notification by electronic mail when the
facsimile has been delivered and when it is requeued for
retransmission. By default Hyla FAX
will notify the submitter only if there is a problem with a
job. 

-r regarding

Pass regarding to the
faxcover(1) program as the value of the
&rsquo;&rsquo;Re:&rsquo;&rsquo; field of any generated cover
page.

-s size

Set the page size to use for the transmitted facsimile.
Facsimile are normally imaged with a system-default page
size (usually letter-size pages, 8.5" by 11", for
sites in North America). Alternate page sizes are specified
symbolically using either the name or abbreviation of an
entry in the pagesizes(5) database; e.g. a3
(ISO A3), a4 (ISO A4), a5 (ISO A5), a6
(ISO A6), b4 (ISO B4), na-let (North American
Letter), us-leg (American Legal), us-led
(American Ledger), us-exe (American Executive),
jp-let (Japanese Letter), and jp-leg (Japanese
Legal). Comparisons are case-insensitive and any match of a
substring of the full page-size name is sufficient; e.g.
&rsquo;&rsquo;legal&rsquo;&rsquo; would match
&rsquo;&rsquo;American Legal&rsquo;&rsquo;.

Note that it
may not be permissible to image into the full page area; the
guaranteed reproducible area for a page is typically inset.
Also, note that while arbitrary page sizes can be specified
through the page size database, only a limited set of page
dimensions are supported by the Group 3 facsimile protocol.
Thus if an odd-size facsimile is submitted for transmission
it may not be possible to determine if it can be sent until
the fax server establishes communication with the remote
facsimile machine.

-S tsi

Pass tsi to the server as the
suggested sender identification to be used, for example, in
tagline imaging and fax protocol.

-t tries

Make no more than tries attempts to send the
facsimile. By default, Hyla FAX will
terminate a job if 3 consecutive attempts to send a
particular page fail, or it appears the receiver is not a
facsimile machine. Otherwise Hyla FAX
places no limit on the number of attempts to send a
facsimile, instead terminating a job if it is not completed
within a kill time timeout interval. Note that a try
is a call in which carrier is established and the facsimile
protocol is commenced; this is contrasted with a call
attempt that might have failed because the line was busy.
Use &rsquo;&rsquo;-1&rsquo;&rsquo; to indicate that no
tries value should be specified to the server.

-T maxdials

Make no more than maxdials calls in attempting to
send the facsimile. By default, HylaFAX will redial 12 times
before killing a job. Use &rsquo;&rsquo;-1&rsquo;&rsquo; to
indicate that no maxdials value should be specified
to the server.

-U voice-no

Pass voice-no to the faxcover(1) program
as the sender&rsquo;s voice number.

-V voice-no

Pass voice-no to the faxcover(1) program
as the destination person&rsquo;s voice number.

-w

Wait for the job to complete before ending the sendfax
session. If this option is used, the sendfax process will
not terminate until the job is completed.

-W fax-no

Pass fax-no to the faxcover(1) program as
the sender&rsquo;s fax number.

-x company

Pass company to the faxcover(1) program as
the destination company name.

-X company

Pass company to the faxcover(1) program as
the sender&rsquo;s company name.

-y location

Pass location to the faxcover(1) program
as the destination company&rsquo;s location.

-Y location

Pass location to the faxcover(1) program
as the sender&rsquo;s company location.

-z filename

Read destinations from filename which contains a
list of the destinations formatted identically as
destinations for the -d option, one per line. Usage
of this option is similar to the -d option and may be
done in conjunction with other -d and -z
options. 

-v

Print information on the standard output about each
conversion and cover sheet generation operation it does. If
-v is specified twice, the protocol between
sendfax and the hfaxd server process that does
the submission work on the remote machine is also
displayed. 

-Z range

Specify that only certain pages of the fax should
actually be transmitted. The range is in a comma-seperated
list of ranges in the form of A[-B][,....]. The range is
specified against the resulting document to be faxed,
excluding any cover pages. So if you have more than one
document, make sure to account for them, and exclude the
cover pages in the range specification. Cover pages will
always be faxed, so a fax with a coverpage and 2 5 page
documents with a range specified of of 1,3,10 will fax the
cover page, and pages 1, 3, and 10 of the combined documents
(page 1 and 3 from the first document, and page 5 of the
second document).

DIAGNOSTICS

The following
messages are generated because of problems encountered on
the local machine.

Could not
call server. The facsimile server on the remote machine
did not respond.

No input
data; transmission aborted. No data was supplied
(typically on the standard input). No facsimile will be
sent.

Error
converting data; command was %s." A data conversion
operation failed; the shell command that was used is
printed.

Can not
convert %s. Data needed to be converted for
transmission, but the required conversion rule was not
located. This may indicate that the Hyla
FAX software was incorrectly installed;
or perhaps that an NFS-mounted directory is
temporarily unavailable.

%s: Can not
determine file type. sendfax was unable to deduce
the type of the file.

%s: Not a
regular file. The file is something other than a regular
file; for example, a directory.

The following
messages may be printed by sendfax. These messages
describe problems encountered by the server process on the
remote machine. This list is incomplete; other messages may
be generated by the server under unusual circumstances.
