NAME

fmt, htmlfmt -
simple text formatters

SYNOPSIS

fmt [
option ... ] [ file ... ]

htmlfmt
[ -a ] [ -c charset ] [ -u
url ] [ file ... ]

DESCRIPTION

Fmt
copies the given files (standard input by default) to
its standard output, filling and indenting lines. The
options are

-l n

Output line length is n, including indent
(default 70).

-w n

A synonym for -l.

-i n

Indent n spaces (default 0).

-j

Do not join short lines: only fold long lines.

Empty lines and
initial white space in input lines are preserved. Empty
lines are inserted between input files.

Fmt is
idempotent: it leaves already formatted text unchanged.

Htmlfmt
performs a similar service, but accepts as input text
formatted with HTML tags. It accepts fmt’s
-l and -w flags and also:

-a

Normally htmlfmt
suppresses the contents of form fields and anchors (URLs and
image files); this flag causes it to print them, in square
brackets. 

-c charset

change the default character
set from iso-8859-1 to charset. This is the character
set assumed if there isn’t one specified by the html
itself in a  directive.

-u url

Use url as the base URL for the document when
displaying anchors; sets -a.

BUGS

Htmlfmt
makes no attempt to render the two-dimensional geometry of
tables; it just treats the table entries as plain,
to-be-formatted text.
