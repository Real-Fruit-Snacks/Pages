NAME

sane-mustek_usb2
- SANE backend for SQ113 based USB flatbed scanners

DESCRIPTION

The
sane-mustek_usb2 library implements a SANE (Scanner
Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to USB flatbed
scanners based on the Service & Quality SQ113 chipset.
At the moment, only the Mustek BearPaw 2448 TA Pro is
supported. It&rsquo;s planned to add support for other
scanners that are based on the SQ113 and maybe SQ11 chip.
For more details, see the mustek_usb2 backend homepage:
http://www.meier-geinitz.de/sane/mustek_usb2-backend/.

This is BETA
software. Especially if you test new or untested scanners,
keep your hand at the scanner&rsquo;s plug and unplug it, if
the head bumps at the end of the scan area.

If you own a
scanner other than the ones listed on the mustek_usb2
homepage that works with this backend, please let me know
this by sending the scanner&rsquo;s exact model name and the
USB vendor and device ids (e.g. from
sane-find-scanner or syslog) to me. Even if the
scanner&rsquo;s name is only slightly different from the
models already listed as supported, please let me know.

LIBUSB ISSUES

Please use
libusb-0.1.8 or later. Without libusb or with older libusb
versions all kinds of trouble can be expected. The scanner
should be found by sane-find-scanner without further
actions. For setting permissions and general USB information
looks at sane-usb(5).

FILES

/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-mustek_usb2.a

The static library implementing
this backend.

/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-mustek_usb2.so

The shared library implementing
this backend (present on systems that support dynamic
loading).

ENVIRONMENT

SANE_DEBUG_MUSTEK_USB2

If the library was compiled
with debug support enabled, this environment variable
controls the debug level for this backend. Higher debug
levels increase the verbosity of the output.

Example: export
SANE_DEBUG_MUSTEK_USB2=4
