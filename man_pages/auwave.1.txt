NAME

auwave -
demonstrates the use of waveforms

SYNOPSIS

auwave
[-audio servername]

DESCRIPTION

auwave
demonstrates the use of waveform elements. The user can
interactively select any waveform supported by the server
and control its frequency and volume. Additionally, the gain
of the output device can be modified.

AUWAVE AND THE ATHENA WIDGET SET

auwave
uses the X Toolkit Intrinsics and the Athena Widget Set. For
more information, see the Athena Widget Set
documentation.

ENVIRONMENT

In addition to
the standard toolkit environment variables, the following
environment variables are used by auwave: 
AUDIOSERVER

This variable specifies the
default audio server to contact if -audio is not
specified on the command line. If this variable is not set
and the -audio is not specified on the command line,
auwave will attempt to connect to the audio server
running on the X Window System display.
