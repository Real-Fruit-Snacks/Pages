NAME
       File::MimeInfo::Rox - Open files by mimetype "Rox style"

SYNOPSIS
         use File::MimeInfo::Magic;
         use File::MimeInfo::Rox qw/:magic/;

         # open some file with the appropriate program
         mime_system($somefile);

         # more verbose version
         my $mt = mimetype($somefile)
           || die "Could not find mimetype for $somefile\n";
         mime_system($somefile, $mt)
           || die "No program to open $somefile available\n";

DESCRIPTION
       This module tries to mimic the behaviour of the rox file browser
       <http://rox.sf.net> when "opening" data files.  It determines the mime
       type and searches in rox's "Choices" directories for a program to
       handle that mimetype.

       See the rox documentation for an extensive discussion of this
       mechanism.

EXPORT
       The methods "mime_exec" and "mime_system" are exported, if you use the
       export tag ":magic" you get the same methods but File::MimeInfo::Magic
       will be used for mimetype lookup.

ENVIRONMENT
       The environment variable "CHOICESPATH" is used when searching for rox's
       config dirs. It defaults to
       "$ENV{HOME}/Choices:/usr/local/share/Choices:/usr/share/Choices"

METHODS
       "mime_system($file)"
       "mime_system($file, $mimetype, @_)"
           Try to open $file with the appropriate program for files of it's
           mimetype. You can use $mimetype to force the mimetype.  Also if you
           already know the mimetype it saves a lot of time to just tell it.

           If either the mimetype couldn't be determined or no appropriate
           program could be found "undef" is returned.  If the actual system
           fails an exception is raised.

           All remaining arguments are passed on to the handler.

       "mime_exec($file)"
       "mime_exec($file, $mimetype, @_)"
           Like "mime_system()" but uses exec instead of system, so it never
           returns if successful.

       "suggest_script_name($mimetype)"
           Returns the list "($dir, $file)" for the suggested place to write
           new script files (or symlinks) for mimetype $mimetype.  The
           suggested dir doesn't need to exist.
