NAME

pmInDomStr,
pmInDomStr_r - convert a performance metric instance
domain identifier into a string

C SYNOPSIS

#include

const char
*pmInDomStr(pmInDom indom); 
char *pmInDomStr_r(pmInDom indom, char
*buf, int buflen);

cc ...
-lpcp

DESCRIPTION

For use in
error and diagnostic messages, pmInDomStr return a
&rsquo;human readable&rsquo; version of the specified
instance domain identifier. The pmInDomStr_r function
does the same, but stores the result in a user-supplied
buffer buf of length buflen, which should have
room for at least 20 bytes.

The value for
the instance domain indom is typically extracted from
a pmDesc structure, following a call to
pmLookupDesc(3) for a particular performance
metric.

Internally, an
instance domain identifier is encoded with two fields:
domain and serial.

pmInDomStr
returns a string with each of the fields appearing as
decimal numbers, separated by periods.

The string
value returned by pmInDomStr is held in a single
static buffer, so the returned value is only valid until the
next call to pmInDomStr.

NOTES

pmInDomStr
returns a pointer to a static buffer and hence is not
thread-safe. Multi-threaded applications should use
pmInDomStr_r instead.

PCP ENVIRONMENT

Environment
variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On
each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains
the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5). Values for these
variables may be obtained programmatically using the
pmGetConfig(3) function.
