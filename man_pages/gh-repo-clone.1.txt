NAME
       gh-repo-clone - Clone a repository locally

SYNOPSIS
       gh repo clone <repository> [<directory>] [-- <gitflags>...]

DESCRIPTION
       Clone  a  GitHub repository locally. Pass additional git clone flags by
       listing them after "--".

       If the "OWNER/" portion of  the  "OWNER/REPO"  repository  argument  is
       omitted, it defaults to the name of the authenticating user.

       If  the repository is a fork, its parent repository will be added as an
       additional git remote called "upstream". The remote name can be config‚Äê
       ured  using  --upstream-remote-name.  The --upstream-remote-name option
       supports an "@owner" value which will name the remote after  the  owner
       of the parent repository.

OPTIONS
       -u, --upstream-remote-name <string>
              Upstream remote name when cloning a fork
