MPT(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual MPT(4)

NAME

mpt &mdash; LSI
Fusion-MPT SCSI/Fibre Channel driver

SYNOPSIS

To compile this driver into the
kernel, place the following lines in your kernel
configuration file:

device scbus

device mpt

Alternatively,
to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following line in loader.conf(5):

mpt_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION

The mpt driver provides
support for the LSI Logic Fusion-MPT family of SCSI, Fibre
Channel and SAS controllers.

HARDWARE

The following controllers are
supported by the mpt driver:

&bull;

LSI Logic 53c1030, LSI Logic
LSI2x320-X (Single and Dual Ultra320 SCSI)

&bull;

LSI Logic AS1064, LSI Logic
AS1068 (SAS/SATA)

&bull;

LSI Logic FC909 (1Gb/s Fibre
Channel)

&bull;

LSI Logic FC909A (Dual 1Gb/s
Fibre Channel)

&bull;

LSI Logic FC919, LSI Logic
7102XP-LC (Single 2Gb/s Fibre Channel)

&bull;

LSI Logic FC929, LSI Logic
FC929X, LSI Logic 7202XP-LC (Dual 2Gb/s Fibre Channel)

&bull;

LSI Logic FC949X (Dual 4Gb/s
Fibre Channel)

&bull;

LSI Logic FC949E, LSI Logic
FC949ES (Dual 4Gb/s Fibre Channel PCI-Express)

The Ultra 320
SCSI controller chips supported by the mpt driver can
be found onboard on many systems including:

&bull;

Dell PowerEdge 1750 thru
2850

&bull;

IBM eServer xSeries 335

These systems
also contain Integrated RAID Mirroring and Integrated RAID
Mirroring Enhanced which this driver also supports.

The SAS
controller chips are also present on many new AMD/Opteron
based systems, like the Sun 4100. Note that this controller
can drive both SAS and SATA drives or a mix of them at the
same time. The Integrated RAID Mirroring available for these
controllers is poorly supported at best.

The Fibre
Channel controller chipset are supported by a broad variety
of speeds and systems. The Apple Fibre Channel HBA is in
fact the FC949ES card.

This driver also
supports target mode for Fibre Channel cards. This support
may be enabled by setting the desired role of the core via
the LSI Logic firmware utility that establishes what roles
the card can take on - no separate compilation is
required.
