NAME

aview - A high
quality ASCII art image viewer

SYNOPSIS

aview
[options] filename.p[ngbp]m 
asciiview [options] filename.xxx

DESCRIPTION

This manual
page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution
because the original program does not have a manual
page.

aview/asciiview
is an image viewer which displays the images in ASCII
art...

aview
supports zooming/unzooming, three dithering modes,
inversion, contrast, brightness, gamma control and can save
into many formats (html, text, ansi, more/less etc.).

aview
can only show files in the PNM file format. But
asciiview automatically converts the file formats to
PNM (with extern programs like NetPBM and ImageMagic) and
then runs aview.

It supports the
usual aalib drivers (e.g. slang, x11 and stdout) as well as
the mousedrivers X11 and gpm.
