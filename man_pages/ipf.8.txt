NAME

ipf &minus;
alters packet filtering lists for IP packet input and
output

SYNOPSIS

ipf [
&minus;6AdDEInoPrsUvVyzZ ] [ &minus;l
 ] [ &minus;F
 ] &minus;f filename>
[ &minus;f filename> [...]]

DESCRIPTION

ipf
opens the filenames listed (treating "&minus;" as
stdin) and parses the file for a set of rules which are to
be added or removed from the packet filter rule set.

Each rule
processed by ipf is added to the kernel&rsquo;s
internal lists if there are no parsing problems. Rules are
added to the end of the internal lists, matching the order
in which they appear when given to ipf.

OPTIONS

&minus;6

This option is required to parse
IPv6 rules and to have them loaded.

&minus;A

Set the list to make changes to the active list
(default). 

&minus;d

Turn debug mode on. Causes a hexdump of filter rules to
be generated as it processes each one.

&minus;D

Disable the filter (if enabled). Not effective for
loadable kernel versions.

&minus;E

Enable the filter (if disabled). Not effective for
loadable kernel versions.

&minus;F

This option specifies which
filter list to flush. The parameter should either be
"i" (input), "o" (output) or
"a" (remove all filter rules). Either a single
letter or an entire word starting with the appropriate
letter maybe used. This option maybe before, or after, any
other with the order on the command line being that used to
execute options.

&minus;F 

To flush entries from the state
table, the -F option is used in conjunction with
either "s" (removes state information about any
non-fully established connections) or "S" (deletes
the entire state table). Only one of the two options may be
given. A fully established connection will show up in
ipfstat -s output as 4/4, with deviations either way
indicating it is not fully established any more.

&minus;f

This option specifies which
files ipf should use to get input from for modifying
the packet filter rule lists.

&minus;I

Set the list to make changes to the inactive list.

&minus;l

Use of the -l flag
toggles default logging of packets. Valid arguments to this
option are pass, block and nomatch.
When an option is set, any packet which exits filtering and
matches the set category is logged. This is most useful for
causing all packets which don&rsquo;t match any of the
loaded rules to be logged.

&minus;n

This flag (no-change) prevents ipf from actually
making any ioctl calls or doing anything which would alter
the currently running kernel.

&minus;o

Force rules by default to be added/deleted to/from the
output list, rather than the (default) input list.

&minus;P

Add rules as temporary entries in the authentication
rule table.

&minus;r

Remove matching filter rules rather than add them to the
internal lists

&minus;s

Swap the active filter list in use to be the
"other" one.

&minus;U

(SOLARIS 2 ONLY) Block packets travelling along the data
stream which aren&rsquo;t recognised as IP packets. They
will be printed out on the console.

&minus;v

Turn verbose mode on. Displays information relating to
rule processing.

&minus;V

Show version information. This will display the version
information compiled into the ipf binary and retrieve it
from the kernel code (if running/present). If it is present
in the kernel, information about its current state will be
displayed (whether logging is active, default filtering,
etc). 

&minus;y

Manually resync the in-kernel interface list maintained
by IP Filter with the current interface status list.

&minus;z

For each rule in the input file, reset the statistics
for it to zero and display the statistics prior to them
being zeroed.

&minus;Z

Zero global statistics held in the kernel for filtering
only (this doesn&rsquo;t affect fragment or state
statistics).

DIAGNOSTICS

Needs to be run
as root for the packet filtering lists to actually be
affected inside the kernel.
