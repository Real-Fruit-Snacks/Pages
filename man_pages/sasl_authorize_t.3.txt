NAME

sasl_authorize_t
- Cyrus SASL documentation

SYNOPSIS

#include

int
sasl_authorize_t(void *context, 
const char *requested_user, unsigned alen, 
const char *auth_identity, unsigned alen, 
const char *def_realm, unsigned urlen, 
struct propctx *propctx)

DESCRIPTION

sasl_authorize_t
is used to check whether the authorized user auth_identity
may act as the user requested_user. For example the user
root may wish to authenticate with his credentials but act
as the user mmercer (with all of mmercerâ€™s rights not
roots). A server application should be very careful, and
probably err on the side of caution, when determining which
users may proxy as whom.

RETURN VALUE

SASL callback
functions should return SASL return codes. See sasl.h for a
complete list. SASL_OK indicates success.
