NAME

pmsignal
- send a signal to one or more processes

SYNOPSIS

$PCP_BINADM_DIR/pmsignal
[-alnp] [-s signal] [PID
...|name ...]

DESCRIPTION

pmsignal
provides a cross-platform event signalling mechanism for use
with tools from the Performance Co-Pilot toolkit. It can be
used to send a named signal (only HUP, USR1, TERM,
and KILL are accepted) to one or more processes.

The processes
are specified directly using PIDs or as program names (with
either the -a or -p options). In the
all case, the set of all running processes is
searched for a basename(1) match on name. In
the program case, process identifiers are extracted
from files in the $PCP_RUN_DIR directrory where file names
are matched on name.pid.

The -n
option reports the list of process identifiers that would
have been signalled, but no signals are actually sent.

If a
signal is not specified, then the TERM signal will be
sent. The list of supported signals is reported when using
the -l option.

On Linux and
UNIX platforms, pmsignal is a simple wrapper around
the kill(1) command. On Windows, the is no direct
equivalent to this mechanism, and so an alternate mechanism
has been implemented - this is only honoured by PCP tools,
however, not all Windows utilities.

OPTIONS

The available
command line options are: 
-a, --all

Send signal to all named
processes.

-l, --list

List supported signals.

-n, --dry-run

List processes that would be
affected.

-p, --program

Extract programs from PCP
runtime PID files.

-s signal,
--signal=signal

Specify the signal to send, one
of: HUP, USR1, TERM, KILL.

-?, --help

Display usage message and
exit.

PCP ENVIRONMENT

Environment
variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On
each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains
the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).
