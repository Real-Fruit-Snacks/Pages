SYNOPSIS

/usr/bin/enable
printer...

/usr/bin/disable
[-c | -W] [ -r [reason]]
printer...

DESCRIPTION

The
enable command activates printers, enabling them to
print requests submitted by the lp command.
enable must be run on the printer server.

The
disable command deactivates printers, disabling them
from printing requests submitted by the lp command.
By default, any requests that are currently printing on
printer will be reprinted in their entirety either on
printer or another member of the same class of
printers. The disable command must be run on the
print server.

Use
lpstat -p to check the status of printers.

enable
and disable only effect queueing on the print
server’s spooling system. Executing these commands
from a client system will have no effect on the server.

OPTIONS

The following
options are supported for use with disable:

-c

Cancels any requests that are currently printing on
printer. This option cannot be used with the
-W option. If the printer is remote, the -c
option will be silently ignored.

-W

Waits until the request currently being printed is
finished before disabling printer. This option cannot
be used with the -c option. If the printer is remote,
the -W option will be silently ignored.

-r [reason]

Assigns a reason for the
disabling of the printer(s). This reason applies to
all printers specified. This reason is reported by
lpstat -p. Enclose reason in quotes if
it contains blanks. The default reason is "unknown
reason" for the existing printer, and "new
printer" for a printer added to the system but not
yet enabled.

OPERANDS

The following
operand is supported for both enable and
disable:
