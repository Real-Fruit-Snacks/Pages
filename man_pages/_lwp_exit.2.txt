NAME

_lwp_exit
&minus; terminate the calling LWP

SYNOPSIS

#include

void
_lwp_exit(void);

DESCRIPTION

The
_lwp_exit() function causes the calling LWP to
terminate. If it is the last non-daemon LWP in the process,
the process exits with a status of 0 (see
exit(2)).

If the LWP was
created undetached, it is transformed into a "zombie
LWP" that retains at least the LWP&rsquo;s ID
until it is waited for (see _lwp_wait(2)). Otherwise,
its ID and system resources may be reclaimed
immediately.
