SYNTAX

troff2html
[ options ] file ... ]

DESCRIPTION

troff2html
converts files written in the troff input language
and converts them to Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). It
works by running the input files through troffcvt and
then through tc2html and tc2html-toc.

troff2html
understands the usual troffcvt options. It also
understands the additional options listed below:

-D

Enable debugging output.

-E

Cause tc2html to echo token information to
stderr as tokens are read from troffcvt.

-n

No execution. Just show the commands that
troff2html would execute to process the document.

-p

Don&rsquo;t run the postprocessors (tc2html and
tc2html-toc). The output from troff2html will
be in the troffcvt output language.

-T title

Specify a title for the
document. This can be used for documents that do not contain
any recognizable title. If the document does contain a
title, it is overridden.

BUGS

troff2html
uses a set of special macros that tell troffcvt how
to generate tc2html-specific output that
tc2html uses to recognize HTML structural elements.
These macros do not work in compatibility mode.
