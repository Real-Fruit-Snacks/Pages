SYNOPSIS

[-p mode] [-x num]
[-y num] [file...]

DESCRIPTION

postdmd
translates DMD bitmap files, as produced by
dmdps, or files written in the Ninth Edition
bitfile(9.5) format into PostScript and writes the
results on the standard output. If no files are
specified, or if − is one of the input files,
the standard input is read.

OPTIONS

-b
num

Pack the bitmap in the output
file using num byte patterns. A value of 0
turns off all packing of the output file. By default,
num is 6.

-c num

Print num copies of each
page. By default only one copy is printed.

-f

Flip the sense of the bits in files before
printing the bitmaps.

-m num

Magnify each logical page by
the factor num. Pages are scaled uniformly about the
origin, which by default is located at the center of each
page. The default magnification is 1.0.

-n num

Print num logical pages
on each piece of paper, where num can be any positive
integer. By default num is set to 1.

-o list

Print pages whose numbers are
given in the comma-separated list. The list contains
single numbers N and ranges N1 −
N2. A missing N1 means the lowest numbered
page, a missing N2 means the highest. The page range
is an expression of logical pages rather than physical
sheets of paper. For example, if you are printing two
logical pages to a sheet, and you specified a range of
4, then two sheets of paper would print, containing
four page layouts. If you specified a page range of
3-4, when requesting two logical pages to a sheet;
then only page 3 and page 4 layouts would print, and
they would appear on one physical sheet of paper.

-p mode

Print files in either
portrait or landscape mode. Only the first character
of mode is significant. The default mode is
portrait.

-x num

Translate the origin num
inches along the positive x axis. The default coordinate
system has the origin fixed at the center of the page, with
positive x to the right and positive y up the page. Positive
num moves everything right. The default offset is
0 inches.

-y num

Translate the origin num
inches along the positive y axis. Positive num moves
everything up the page. The default offset is 0.

Only one bitmap
is printed on each logical page, and each of the input
files must contain complete descriptions of at least
one bitmap. Decreasing the pattern size using the -b
option may help throughput on printers with fast processors
(such as PS-810s), while increasing the pattern size will
often be the right move on older models (such as
PS-800s).

EXIT STATUS

The following
exit values are returned:

0

Successful completion.

non-zero

An error occurred.
