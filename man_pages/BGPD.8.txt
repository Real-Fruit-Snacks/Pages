NAME

bgpd &mdash; Border
Gateway Protocol (BGP) routing daemon

SYNOPSIS

bgpd [-cdnvV]
[-D macro=value]
[-f file]

DESCRIPTION

bgpd is a Border Gateway
Protocol (BGP) daemon which manages the network routing
tables. Its main purpose is to exchange information
concerning "network reachability" with other BGP
systems. bgpd uses the Border Gateway Protocol,
Version 4, as described in RFC 4271.

BGP is an
exterior gateway protocol using a multiple step decision
process to find the best path. Advanced filtering can be
used to influence the route decision for traffic
engineering. The session engine of bgpd is
responsible for maintaining the TCP session with each
neighbor. Updates are passed to the Route Decision Engine
(RDE) where the paths are filtered and used to compute a
Routing Information Base (RIB). The parent process is
responsible for keeping the RIB in sync with the kernel
routing table.

The route
decision process selects the best path by evaluating all
paths to the same destination. The decision process
continues to the next step if paths have equal attributes.
Paths that are less preferred are taken out of consideration
until there is only one path left.

1.

All paths with errors or loops
are not eligible.

2.

Paths with an unreachable
nexthop are not eligible. After this step all remaining
paths are valid.

3.

The path with the highest
LOCAL_PREF is selected.

4.

The path with the shortest
AS path attribute is selected.

5.

The ORIGIN attribute is
compared. The order is IGP before EGP before incomplete
origins.

6.

The path with the lowest
MULTI_EXIT_DISC metric is selected. Normally, this
value is only considered when choosing between multiple
routes sent by the same neighbouring AS. However, if
&ldquo;rde med compare always&rdquo; is set in the
configuration, the metric is compared for routes sent by any
AS.

7.

Comparison of the BGP session
type. Paths learned over an external (EBGP) session are
preferred over those learned via an internal (IBGP)
session.

8.

The path with the highest local
weight is selected.

9.

If &ldquo;rde route-age
evaluate&rdquo; is set then the oldest path is selected.

10.

The path coming from the
neighbor with the lowest BGP ID wins. If the
ORIGINATOR_ID attribute is present, that value will
be used in the comparison instead.

11.

The path with the shortest
CLUSTER_LIST attribute is selected. If it is not
present then a length of 0 is used in the comparison.

12.

The path coming from the peer
with the lowest IP address is selected. IPv4 sessions will
be preferred over IPv6 ones.

Attributes set
by filters can be used to tip the decision process to prefer
particular paths over others. This can be achieved by
changing the localpref, med, or weight
attributes. AS path prepending or changing the med or
origin attribute can be used to influence the routing
behaviour on remote systems.

To have
bgpd enabled at boot time, use &ldquo;rcctl enable
bgpd&rdquo;, which sets

bgpd_flags=""

in
rc.conf.local(8).

When bgpd
starts up, it reads settings from a configuration file,
typically bgpd.conf(5). A running bgpd process can be
controlled using the bgpctl(8) utility.

The options are
as follows:

-c

Force
bgpd to do carp(4) demotion at startup when the
demote functionality is used. Normally, bgpd
will only do demotion at startup when the demotion counter
for the group in question is already greater than 0.
bgpd will start handling demotion after all sessions
with demotion configured for the given group have been
successfully established. At system startup, rc(8) has the
demotion counter for the group carp increased until
after bgpd is started, so this option should
not be used in rc.conf(8).

-D
macro=value

Define macro to be set
to value on the command line. Overrides the
definition of macro in the configuration file.

-d

Do not
daemonize. If this option is specified, bgpd will run
in the foreground and log to stderr.

-f file

Use file
as the configuration file, instead of the default
/etc/bgpd.conf.

-n

Configtest
mode. Only check the configuration file for validity.

-v

Produce more
verbose output.

-V

Show the
version and exit.

FILES 
/etc/bgpd.conf

Default
bgpd configuration file.

/run/openbgpd/bgpd.sock.

Default
bgpd control socket, where  is
the routing domain in which bgpd has been
started.
