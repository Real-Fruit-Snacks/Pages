DESCRIPTION

MLD is a control plane protocol
used by IPv6 hosts and routers to propagate multicast group
membership information. Normally this protocol is not used
directly, except by the kernel itself, in response to
multicast membership requests by user applications.
Multicast routing protocol daemons may open a raw socket to
directly interact with mld and receive membership
reports.

As of
FreeBSD 8.0, MLD version 2 is implemented. This adds
support for Source-Specific Multicast (SSM), whereby
applications may communicate to upstream multicast routers
that they are only interested in receiving multicast streams
from particular sources. The retransmission of state-change
reports adds some robustness to the protocol.

SYSCTL VARIABLES 
net.inet6.mld.ifinfo

This opaque read-only variable
exposes the per-link MLDv2 status to ifmcstat(8).

net.inet6.mld.gsrdelay

This variable specifies the
time threshold, in seconds, for processing Group-and-Source
Specific Queries (GSR). As GSR query processing requires
maintaining state on the host, it may cause memory to be
allocated, and is therefore a potential attack point for
Denial-of-Service (DoS). If more than one GSR query is
received within this threshold, it will be dropped, to
mitigate the potential for DoS.

net.inet6.mld.v1enable

If this variable is non-zero,
then MLDv1 membership queries (and host reports) will be
processed by this host, and backwards compatibility will be
enabled until the v1 &rsquo;Older Version Querier
Present&rsquo; timer expires. This sysctl is normally
enabled by default.
