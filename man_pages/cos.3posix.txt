COS(3POSIX)                POSIX Programmer's Manual               COS(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       cos, cosf, cosl — cosine function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <math.h>

       double cos(double x);
       float cosf(float x);
       long double cosl(long double x);

DESCRIPTION
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with  the
       ISO C  standard.  Any  conflict between the requirements described here
       and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017
       defers to the ISO C standard.

       These  functions shall compute the cosine of their argument x, measured
       in radians.

       An application wishing to check for error situations should  set  errno
       to  zero  and  call  feclearexcept(FE_ALL_EXCEPT)  before calling these
       functions. On return, if errno is non-zero or fetestexcept(FE_INVALID |
       FE_DIVBYZERO  |  FE_OVERFLOW  | FE_UNDERFLOW) is non-zero, an error has
       occurred.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, these functions shall return the cosine  of
       x.

       If x is NaN, a NaN shall be returned.

       If x is ±0, the value 1.0 shall be returned.

       If x is ±Inf, a domain error shall occur, and a NaN shall be returned.

ERRORS
       These functions shall fail if:

       Domain Error
                   The x argument is ±Inf.

                   If  the  integer expression (math_errhandling & MATH_ERRNO)
                   is non-zero, then errno shall be set to [EDOM].  If the in‐
                   teger  expression  (math_errhandling  &  MATH_ERREXCEPT) is
                   non-zero, then the invalid floating-point  exception  shall
                   be raised.

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
   Taking the Cosine of a 45-Degree Angle
           #include <math.h>
           ...
           double radians = 45 * M_PI / 180;
           double result;
           ...
           result = cos(radians);

APPLICATION USAGE
       These  functions  may  lose accuracy when their argument is near an odd
       multiple of π/2 or is far from 0.

       On error, the expressions (math_errhandling & MATH_ERRNO) and (math_er‐
       rhandling & MATH_ERREXCEPT) are independent of each other, but at least
       one of them must be non-zero.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
