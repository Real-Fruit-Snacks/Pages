DUMMYNET(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual DUMMYNET(4)

NAME

dummynet â€” traffic
shaper, bandwidth manager and delay emulator

DESCRIPTION

The dummynet system
facility permits the control of traffic going through the
various network interfaces, by applying bandwidth and queue
size limitations, implementing different scheduling and
queue management policies, and emulating delays and
losses.

The user
interface for dummynet is implemented by the ipfw(8)
utility, so please refer to the ipfw(8) manpage for a
complete description of the dummynet capabilities and
how to use it.

Kernel
Options 
The following options in the kernel configuration file are
related to dummynet operation:

IPFIREWALL

enable
ipfirewall (required for dummynet)

IPFIREWALL_VERBOSE

enable firewall
output

IPFIREWALL_VERBOSE_LIMIT

limit firewall
output

DUMMYNET

enable
dummynet operation

HZ

set the timer
granularity

Generally, the
following options are required:

options
IPFIREWALL 
options DUMMYNET

options HZ=1000

# strongly recommended

Additionally,
one may want to increase the number of mbuf clusters (used
to store network packets) according to the sum of the
bandwidth-delay products and queue sizes of all configured
pipes.

HISTORY

The dummynet facility was
initially implemented as a testing tool for TCP congestion
control by Luigi Rizzo luigi [AT] iet.it>, as
described on ACM Computer Communication Review, Jan.97
issue. Later it has been modified to work at the IP and
bridging levels, integrated with the ipfw(4) packet filter,
and extended to support multiple queueing and scheduling
policies.
