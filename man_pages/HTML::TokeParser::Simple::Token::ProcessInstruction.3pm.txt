HTML::TokeParser::SimpHTML::TokeParser::Simple::Token::ProcessInstruction(3pm)

NAME
       HTML::TokeParser::Simple::Token::ProcessInstruction - Token.pm process
       instruction class.

SYNOPSIS
        use HTML::TokeParser::Simple;
        my $p = HTML::TokeParser::Simple->new( $somefile );

        while ( my $token = $p->get_token ) {
            # This prints all text in an HTML doc (i.e., it strips the HTML)
            next unless $token->is_text;
            print $token->as_is;
        }

DESCRIPTION
       Process Instructions are from XML.  This is very handy if you need to
       parse out PHP and similar things with a parser.

       Currently, there appear to be some problems with process instructions.
       You can override this class if you need finer grained handling of
       process instructions.

       "is_pi()" and "is_process_instruction()" both return true.

OVERRIDDEN METHODS
       •   get_token0

       •   is_pi

       •   is_process_instruction

       •   return_token0
