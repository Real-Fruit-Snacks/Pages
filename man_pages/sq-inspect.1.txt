NAME

sq inspect -
Inspect data, like file(1)

SYNOPSIS

sq
inspect [OPTIONS] FILE

DESCRIPTION

Inspect data,
like file(1).

It is often
difficult to tell from cursory inspection using cat(1) or
file(1) what kind of OpenPGP one is looking at. This
subcommand inspects the data and provides a meaningful
human-readable description of it.

&rsquo;sq
inspect&rsquo; respects the reference time set by the
top-level &rsquo;--time&rsquo; argument. It uses the
reference time when determining what binding signatures are
active.
