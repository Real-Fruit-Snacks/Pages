NG_IFACE(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual NG_IFACE(4)

NAME

ng_iface â€”
interface netgraph node type

SYNOPSIS

#include

DESCRIPTION

An iface node is both a
netgraph node and a system networking interface. When an
iface node is created, a new interface appears which
is accessible via ifconfig(8). Iface node interfaces
are named ng0, ng1, etc. When a node is shutdown, the
corresponding interface is removed and the interface name
becomes available for reuse by future iface nodes;
new nodes always take the first unused interface. The node
itself is assigned the same name as its interface, unless
the name already exists, in which case the node remains
unnamed.

An iface
node has a single hook corresponding to each supported
protocol. Packets transmitted via the interface flow out the
corresponding protocol-specific hook. Similarly, packets
received on a hook appear on the interface as packets
received into the corresponding protocol stack. The
currently supported protocols are IP, IPv6, ATM, NATM, and
NS.

An iface
node can be configured as a point-to-point interface or a
broadcast interface. The configuration can only be changed
when the interface is down. The default mode is
point-to-point.

Iface
nodes support the Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF).

HOOKS

This node type supports the
following hooks:

inet

Transmission
and reception of IP packets.

inet6

Transmission
and reception of IPv6 packets.

atm

Transmission
and reception of ATM packets.

natm

Transmission
and reception of NATM packets.

ns

Transmission
and reception of NS packets.

CONTROL MESSAGES

This node type supports the
generic control messages, plus the following:

NGM_IFACE_GET_IFNAME
(getifname)

Returns the name of the
associated interface as a NUL-terminated ASCII string.
Normally this is the same as the name of the node.

NGM_IFACE_GET_IFINDEX
(getifindex)

Returns the global index of the
associated interface as a 32 bit integer.

NGM_IFACE_POINT2POINT
(point2point)

Set the interface to
point-to-point mode. The interface must not currently be
up.

NGM_IFACE_BROADCAST
(broadcast)

Set the interface to broadcast
mode. The interface must not currently be up.

SHUTDOWN

This node shuts down upon
receipt of a NGM_SHUTDOWN control message. The associated
interface is removed and becomes available for use by future
iface nodes.

Unlike most
other node types, an iface node does not go
away when all hooks have been disconnected; rather, and
explicit NGM_SHUTDOWN control message is required.

ALTQ Support

The ng_iface interface
supports ALTQ bandwidth management feature. However,
ng_iface is a special case, since it is not a
physical interface with limited bandwidth. One should not
turn ALTQ on ng_iface if the latter corresponds to
some tunneled connection, e.g. PPPoE or PPTP. In this case,
ALTQ should be configured on the interface that is used to
transmit the encapsulated packets. In case when your graph
ends up with some kind of serial line, either synchronous or
modem, the ng_iface is the right place to turn ALTQ
on.
