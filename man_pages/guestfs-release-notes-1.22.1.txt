RELEASE NOTES FOR LIBGUESTFS 1.22

These release
notes only cover the differences from the previous
stable/dev branch split (1.20.0). For detailed changelogs,
please see the git repository, or the ChangeLog file
distributed in the tarball.

New
features 
API

Remote access
to disks:

&bull;

Network Block Device (nbd)

&bull;

Secure Shell (ssh)

&bull;

HTTP and HTTPS

&bull;

FTP and FTPS

&bull;

iSCSI

&bull;

Gluster

&bull;

Ceph/rbd (Mike Kelly)

&bull;

Sheepdog

&bull;

TFTP

The SYSLINUX
and EXTLINUX bootloaders can now be installed in disk images
using the API.

Inspection can
now handle filesystems such as btrfs where subvolumes are
separately mountable (Matthew Booth).

"Attach
methods" are now known as "backends".
Compatibility with existing code is preserved.

Filenames can
contain &rsquo;:&rsquo;, as long as newer QEMU is being
used.

Tools

Virt-alignment-scan
and virt-df scan multiple guests in parallel.

Guestmount now
passes errno accurately back to userspace in almost all
cases.

Guestfish and
other tools can now use a URI-like syntax to access remote
disks, eg:

guestfish -a
ssh://example.com/path/to/disk.img

Guestfish and
guestmount now allow you to specify the filesystem type when
mounting, which is more secure (Dave Vasilevsky).

Guestfish is
now the "guest filesystem shell".

Guestfish
allows only 1 "true" "t" "yes"
"y" "on" 0 "false"
"f" "no" "n" "off"
for boolean values (case insensitive), and gives an error
for all other strings.

New tool
"guestunmount" for unmounting FUSE filesystems
safely.

"guestmount
--no-fork" flag prevents guestmount from
daemonizing.

Virt-resize now
uses sparse copies by default, saving considerable space for
guests which are mostly empty.

Bash tab
completion has been rewritten and can now handle most tools,
and correctly tab-complete "--long" options. In
addition, bash completion scripts are loaded on demand.

Language
bindings

The Java API
now supports events.

The Python
object now inherits from the "object" base
class.

Python methods
which previously returned lists of tuples can now be made to
return a Python dict. For backwards compatibility, you have
to enable this by using the constructor option
"guestfs.GuestFS (python_return_dict=True)".

The PHP
bindings are now tested properly, and have had multiple
fixes.

The
long-deprecated Perl "Sys::Guestfs::Lib" library
has been removed.

Examples

New example
program showing how to enable debugging and capture log
messages.

Other

Distributors
can add arbitrary extra packages to the appliance by
doing:

./configure
--with-extra-packages="list of package names"

Distributors
can use:

./configure
--with-supermin-extra-options="..."

to add
arbitrary extra options to supermin.

Security

No security issues were found in this release.

New APIs

cp-r 
extlinux 
feature-available 
get-program 
is-whole-device 
part-get-gpt-type 
part-set-gpt-type 
rename 
set-program 
syslinux

C only:

guestfs_event_to_string

Internals

The febootstrap tool has now been renamed to
"supermin". Libguestfs can use either, but now
prefers "supermin".
http://people.redhat.com/~rjones/supermin/

libxml2 is
required to build libguestfs.

The
hivexregedit program (from hivex) is required to build from
git.

Internal
functions can no longer be used unless the caller defines
"-DGUESTFS_PRIVATE=1".

Enable C
compiler warnings in Python, Ruby bindings.

Fail early and
clearly if libvirt does not support qemu/KVM (eg. if default
libvirt connection is to Xen).

"make
print-subdirs" rule, useful for selectively running
tests.

Multiple fixes
to allow separated (sourcedir != builddir) builds.

Multiple fixes
to Haskell bindings.

"ln"
and "ln-f" APIs now capture "errno"
correctly.

Language
binding tests use (mostly) a standard numbering scheme and
aim to test the same range of features in each language.
Also the number of launches required has been reduced so
these tests should run much more quickly.

Library code
internally uses GCC "__attribute__((cleanup))" (if
available) to simplify memory allocation.

Internal header
files have been reorganized. See the comments in
src/guestfs-internal*.h

Internal code
shared between the library and certain tools is now located
in a static "libutils" library.

Almost all
subdirectories can now use parallel builds, although note
that the top-level directories still build in series.

Use of
"PATH_MAX" and "NAME_MAX" has been
eliminated from the code.

The Java API
now requires JVM &ge; 1.6.

Force use of
"serial-tests" with automake &ge; 1.12.

Use of sockets
in the library protocol layer is abstracted, allowing other
non-POSIX layers to be added in future (see
src/conn-socket.c).

"qemu-img
info --output json" is used if available, for more
secure parsing of the output of this command.

Distros can now
use "make INSTALLDIRS=vendor install" to place
Ruby bindings in vendordir. This eliminates a non-upstream
patch carried by both Fedora and Debian.

Valgrind log
files are now written to
tmp/valgrind-DATE-PID.log

"make
clean" cleans the local "tmp/" directory.

The C API tests
have been rewritten using a more flexible generator language
that allows arbitrary C code to be executing during
tests.
