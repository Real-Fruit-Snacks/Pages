DESCRIPTION

As part of the
Performance Co-Pilot Log Import API (see
LOGIMPORT(3)), pmiErrStr translates error
codes returned from the other routines in the Log Import
library into printable error messages.

code
would normally have a negative value. As a special case, if
code is -1 then the error code returned from the last
routine called in the LOGIMPORT library for this context
will be used.

The
pmiErrStr_r function does the same, but stores the
result in a user-supplied buffer buf of length
buflen, which should have room for at least
PMI_MAXERRMSGLEN bytes.

The set of
possible error codes and messages is all those defined by
pmErrStr(3) and PCPIntro(3), plus the
additonal ones defined in  with
error code names of the form PMI_ERR_....
