RETURN(1POSIX)             POSIX Programmer's Manual            RETURN(1POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       return — return from a function or dot script

SYNOPSIS
       return [n]

DESCRIPTION
       The return utility shall cause the shell to stop executing the  current
       function or dot script. If the shell is not currently executing a func‐
       tion or dot script, the results are unspecified.

OPTIONS
       None.

OPERANDS
       See the DESCRIPTION.

STDIN
       Not used.

INPUT FILES
       None.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       None.

ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
       Default.

STDOUT
       Not used.

STDERR
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

OUTPUT FILES
       None.

EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
       None.

EXIT STATUS
       The value of the special parameter '?'  shall be set to n, an  unsigned
       decimal  integer, or to the exit status of the last command executed if
       n is not specified. If n is not an  unsigned  decimal  integer,  or  is
       greater  than 255, the results are unspecified. When return is executed
       in a trap action, the last command is considered to be the command that
       executed immediately preceding the trap action.

CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
       Default.

       The following sections are informative.

APPLICATION USAGE
       None.

EXAMPLES
       None.

RATIONALE
       The behavior of return when not in a function or dot script differs be‐
       tween the System V shell and the KornShell. In the System V shell  this
       is an error, whereas in the KornShell, the effect is the same as exit.

       The  results  of  returning a number greater than 255 are undefined be‐
       cause of differing practices in the various historical implementations.
       Some  shells  AND out all but the low-order 8 bits; others allow larger
       values, but not of unlimited size.

       See the discussion of appropriate exit status values under exit.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
