NAME
       sane-hp3900 - SANE backend for RTS8822 chipset based scanners

DESCRIPTION
       The  sane-hp3900  library  implements  a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy)
       backend that provides access at least  to  the  following  USB  flatbed
       scanners:

              Model:                     Chipset:

       This is ALPHA software. Keep your hand at the scanner's plug and unplug
       it, if scanner does not start to scan. See also the BUGS section.

       If  you  own a scanner other than the ones listed above that works with
       this backend, please let us know this by sending  the  scanner's  exact
       model   name   and   the   USB   vendor   and  device  ids  (e.g.  from
       /proc/bus/usb/devices, sane-find-scanner(1) or syslog) to us.  Even  if
       the scanner's name is only slightly different from the models mentioned
       above, please let us know.

CONFIGURATION
       The contents of the hp3900.conf file is a list of usb lines  containing
       vendor  and  product  ids that correspond to USB scanners. The file can
       also contain the names of device files that correspond to  an  HP  39XX
       scanner.   Empty  lines and lines starting with a hash mark (#) are ig‐
       nored.  The scanners  are  autodetected  by  usb  vendor_id  product_id
       statements  which  are  already included into hp3900.conf.  "vendor_id"
       and "product_id" are hexadecimal numbers that identify the scanner.  If
       autodetection does not work, add the device name of your scanner to the
       configuration file,

FILES
       /etc/sane.d/hp3900.conf
              The  backend  configuration  file  (see  also   description   of
              SANE_CONFIG_DIR below).

       /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-hp3900.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-hp3900.so
              The shared library implementing this backend (present on systems
              that support dynamic loading).

ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_CONFIG_DIR
              This environment variable specifies the list of directories that
              may contain the configuration file.  On *NIX systems, the direc‐
              tories are separated by a colon (`:'), under OS/2, they are sep‐
              arated  by a semi-colon (`;').  If this variable is not set, the
              configuration file  is  searched  in  two  default  directories:
              first,   the   current   working  directory  (.)   and  then  in
              /etc/sane.d.  If the value of the environment variable ends with
              the  directory separator character, then the default directories
              are searched after the explicitly  specified  directories.   For
              example,  setting SANE_CONFIG_DIR to "/tmp/config:" would result
              in directories tmp/config, ., and /etc/sane.d being searched (in
              this order).

       SANE_DEBUG_HP3900
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this en‐
              vironment variable controls the debug level  for  this  backend.
              Higher debug levels increase the verbosity of the output.

              Example: export SANE_DEBUG_HP3900=4

BUGS
       Scanning is only tested with Linux/ix86/gcc. Be careful when testing on
       other operating systems and especially  on  big-endian  platforms.  The
       scanner may get wrong data.
