NAME
       update-exim4.conf.template  -  Regenerate exim4 configuration file tem‐
       plate.

SYNOPSIS
       update-exim4.conf.template  [-h|--help]  [-n|--nobackup]   [-o|--output
       file] [-r|--run]

OPTIONS
       -h|--help
              Show short help message and exit

       -n|--nobackup
              Overwrite    existing   file,   instead   of   keeping   it   as
              /etc/exim4/exim4.conf.template.bak.random-number

       -o|--output file
              Write output to file instead of /etc/exim4/exim4.conf.template.

       -r|--run
              Actually do something. If  this  option  is  not  specified  up‐
              date-exim4.conf.template  will exit immediately. This option was
              introduced because update-exim4.conf.template overwrites config‐
              uration files.

DESCRIPTION
       The  script  update-exim4.conf.template regenerates the main configura‐
       tion file template /etc/exim4/exim4.conf.template from  the  configura‐
       tion snippets in the /etc/exim4/conf.d directory tree.

       This     process     will    overwrite    all    local    changes    in
       /etc/exim4/exim4.conf.template and might be useful if there  are  local
       changes  in  the /etc/exim4/conf.d directory tree, for example by a new
       mail related package dropping its own configuration snippets in there.

       update-exim4.conf.template ignores all files in  the  conf.d  directory
       that  have  a filename which does not consist only of letters, numbers,
       underscores and hyphens ([:alnum:]_-), similar  to  run-parts(8).   For
       easy    interaction   with   packages   extending   Exim   additionally
       /etc/exim4/conf.d/foo/bar.rul      is       used       instead       of
       /etc/exim4/conf.d/foo/bar if it exists!

ENVIRONMENT
       If  CONFDIR is set update-exim4.conf.template will search for the input
       files below $CONFDIR/conf.d  instead  of  /etc/exim4/conf.d/  and  will
       write   the   output  to  $CONFDIR/exim4.conf.template  instead  of  to
       /etc/exim4/exim4.conf.template (unless overridden with -o or --output).

BUGS
       This manual page needs a major re-work. If somebody knows better  groff
       than  us  and  has more experience in writing manual pages, any patches
       would be greatly appreciated.
