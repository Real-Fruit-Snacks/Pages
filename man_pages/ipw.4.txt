IPW(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual IPW(4)

NAME

ipw &mdash; Intel
PRO/Wireless 2100 IEEE 802.11 driver

SYNOPSIS

To compile this driver into the
kernel, place the following lines in your kernel
configuration file:

device ipw

device ipwfw 
device pci 
device wlan 
device firmware

Alternatively,
to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following line in loader.conf(5):

if_ipw_load="YES"

In both cases,
place the following line in loader.conf(5) to acknowledge
the firmware license (see below):

legal.intel_ipw.license_ack=1

DESCRIPTION

The ipw driver provides
support for the Intel PRO/Wireless 2100 MiniPCI network
adapter. ipw supports station, adhoc,
and monitor mode operation. Only one virtual
interface may be configured at any time. For more
information on configuring this device, see ifconfig(8).

This driver
requires the firmware built with the ipwfw module to
work. For the loaded firmware to be enabled for use the
license at /usr/share/doc/legal/intel_ipw.LICENSE
must be agreed by adding the following line to
loader.conf(5):

legal.intel_ipw.license_ack=1

FILES 
/usr/share/doc/legal/intel_ipw.LICENSE

ipw
firmware license

EXAMPLES

Join an existing BSS network
(i.e., connect to an access point):

ifconfig wlan
create wlandev ipw0 inet 192.168.0.20 \ 
netmask 0xffffff00

Join a specific
BSS network with network name
&rsquo;&rsquo;my_net&rsquo;&rsquo;:

ifconfig wlan
create wlandev ipw0 ssid my_net up

Join a specific
BSS network with 64-bit WEP encryption:

ifconfig wlan
create wlandev ipw0 ssid my_net \

wepmode on wepkey 0x1234567890 weptxkey 1 up

Join a specific
BSS network with 128-bit WEP encryption:

ifconfig wlan
create wlandev ipw0 wlanmode adhoc ssid my_net \ 
wepmode on wepkey 0x01020304050607080910111213 weptxkey
1

DIAGNOSTICS

ipw%d: device
timeout  The driver will reset the hardware. This
should not happen.

ipw%d:
firmware error  The onboard microcontroller crashes
for some reason. The driver will reset the hardware. This
should not happen.

ipw%d:
timeout waiting for firmware initialization to
complete  The onboard microcontroller failed to
initialize in time. This should not happen.

ipw%d: could
not load firmware image &rsquo;%s&rsquo;  The
driver failed to load the firmware image using the
firmware(9) subsystem. Verify the ipwfw(4) firmware module
is installed and the license agreement loader(8) tunable has
been set.

ipw%d: could
not load microcode  An attempt to upload the
microcode image to the onboard microcontroller failed. This
should not happen.

ipw%d: could
not load firmware  An attempt to upload the
firmware image to the onboard microcontroller failed. This
should not happen.
