AHD(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual AHD(4)

NAME

ahd &mdash; Adaptec
PCI/PCI-X Ultra320 SCSI host adapter driver

SYNOPSIS

To compile this driver into the
kernel, place the following lines in your kernel
configuration file:

device pci

device scbus 
device ahd

To compile in
debugging code:

options AHD_DEBUG 
options AHD_DEBUG_OPTS= 
options AHD_REG_PRETTY_PRINT

To configure
one or more controllers to assume the target role:

options
AHD_TMODE_ENABLE=

Alternatively,
to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following line in loader.conf(5):

ahd_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION

This driver provides access to
the SCSI bus(es) connected to Adaptec AIC79xx host adapter
chips.

Driver features
include support for narrow and wide busses, fast, ultra,
ultra2, ultra160, and ultra320 synchronous transfers,
packetized transfers, tagged queueing, 512 SCB&rsquo;s, and
target mode.

The
AHD_DEBUG_OPTS option is used to control which diagnostic
messages are printed to the console when AHD_DEBUG is
enabled. Logically OR the following bits together:

Value
Function

0x0001

Show miscellaneous information

0x0002

Show sense data

0x0004

Show Serial EEPROM contents

0x0008

Show bus termination settings

0x0010

Show host memory usage

0x0020

Show SCSI protocol messages

0x0040

Show mode pointer of the chip register window

0x0080

Show selection timeouts

0x0100

Show FIFO usage messages

0x0200

Show Queue Full status

0x0400

Show SCB queue status

0x0800

Show inbound packet information

0x1000

Show S/G list information

0x2000

Enable extra diagnostic code in the firmware

The
AHD_REG_PRETTY_PRINT option compiles in support for
human-readable bit definitions for each register that is
printed by the debugging code. However, it also bloats the
compiled size of the driver by approximately 215KB.

Individual
controllers may be configured to operate in the target role
through the AHD_TMODE_ENABLE configuration option. The value
assigned to this option should be a bitmap of all units
where target mode is desired. For example, a value of 0x25
would enable target mode on units 0, 2, and 5. Note that
target mode is only supported for ultra160 speeds and
below.

Per target
configuration performed in the SCSI-Select menu, accessible
at boot, is honored by this driver. This includes
synchronous/asynchronous transfers, maximum synchronous
negotiation rate, wide transfers, disconnection, and the
host adapter&rsquo;s SCSI ID.

HISTORY

The ahd driver first
appeared in FreeBSD 4.7.

AUTHORS

The ahd driver, the
AIC7xxx sequencer-code assembler, and the firmware running
on the aic79xx chips was written by Justin T. Gibbs. This
manual page is based on the ahc(4) manual page.

BUGS

The current generation of 79xx
chips do not support target mode in Ultra320 mode. Target
mode in general has not been well tested in this driver.
