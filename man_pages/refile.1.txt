DESCRIPTION

refile
moves (see mv(1)) or links (see ln(1))
messages from a source folder into one or more destination
folders.

If you think of
a message as a sheet of paper, this operation is not unlike
filing the sheet of paper (or copies) in file cabinet
folders. When a message is filed, it is linked into the
destination folder(s) if possible, and is copied otherwise.
As long as the destination folders are all on the same file
system, multiple filing causes little storage overhead. This
facility provides a good way to cross-file or multiple-index
messages. For example, if a message is received from Jones
about the ARPA Map Project, the command

refile cur
+jones +Map

would allow the
message to be found in either of the two folders
&rsquo;jones&rsquo; or &rsquo;Map&rsquo;.

You may specify
the source folder using -src +folder. If this
is not given, the current folder is used by default. If no
message is specified, then &rsquo;cur&rsquo; is used by
default.

The option
-file file directs refile to use the
specified file as the source message to be filed, rather
than a message from a folder. Note that the file should be a
validly formatted message, just like any other nmh
message. It should not be in mail drop format (to
convert a file in mail drop format to a folder of nmh
messages, see inc(1)).

If a
destination folder doesn&rsquo;t exist, refile will
ask if you want to create it. A negative response will abort
the file operation. If the standard input for refile
is not a tty, then refile will not ask any
questions and will proceed as if the user answered
&ldquo;yes&rdquo; to all questions.

The option
-link preserves the source folder copy of the message
(i.e., it does an ln(1) rather than a mv(1)),
whereas, -nolink (the default) deletes the filed
messages from the source folder.

Normally when a
message is refiled, for each destination folder it is
assigned the number which is one above the current highest
message number in that folder. Use of the -preserve
switch will override this message renaming, and try to
preserve the number of the message. If a conflict for a
particular folder occurs when using the -preserve
switch, then refile will use the next available
message number which is above the message number you wish to
preserve.

As message
sequences are folder-specific, moving the message from the
source folder removes it from all its sequences in that
folder. -retainsequences adds it to those same
sequences in the destination folder, creating any that
don&rsquo;t exist. This adding does not apply for the
&ldquo;cur&rdquo; sequence.

If -link
is not specified (or -nolink is specified), the filed
messages will be removed from the source folder. The default
is to remove these messages by renaming them with a
site-dependent prefix (usually a comma). Such files will
then need to be removed in some manner after a certain
amount of time. Many sites arrange for cron to remove
these files once a day, so check with your system
administrator.

Alternately, if
you wish for refile to really remove the files
representing these messages from the source folder, you can
use the -unlink switch (not to be confused with the
-link switch). But messages removed by this method
cannot be later recovered.

If you prefer a
more sophisticated method of &rsquo;removing&rsquo; the
messages from the source folder, you can define the
rmmproc profile component. For example, you can add a
profile component such as

rmmproc:
/home/coleman/bin/rmm_msgs

then
refile will instead call the named program or script
to handle the message files.

The user may
specify -rmmproc program on the command line
to override this profile specification. The
-normmproc option forces the message files to be
deleted by renaming or unlinking them as described
above.

The
-draft switch tells refile to file the
/draft.

PROFILE COMPONENTS

Path: To
determine the user&rsquo;s nmh directory 
Current-Folder: To find the default current folder 
Folder-Protect: To set mode when creating a new folder 
rmmproc: Program to delete the message

DEFAULTS

&rsquo;-src +folder&rsquo;
defaults to the current folder 
&rsquo;msgs&rsquo; defaults to cur 
&rsquo;-nolink&rsquo; 
&rsquo;-nounlink&rsquo; 
&rsquo;-nopreserve&rsquo; 
&rsquo;-noretainsequences&rsquo;

CONTEXT

If -src
+folder is given, it will become the current folder.
If neither -link nor &rsquo;all&rsquo; is specified,
the current message in the source folder will be set to the
last message specified; otherwise, the current message
won&rsquo;t be changed.

If the
&ldquo;Previous-Sequence&rdquo; profile entry is set, in
addition to defining the named sequences from the source
folder, refile will also define those sequences for
the destination folders. See mh-sequence(5) for
information concerning the previous sequence.

BUGS

Since
refile and rmm use your rmmproc to
delete the message, the rmmproc must not call
refile or rmm without specifying
-normmproc, or you will create an infinite loop.
