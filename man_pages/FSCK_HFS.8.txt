DESCRIPTION

The fsck_hfs utility
verifies and repairs standard HFS and HFS+ file systems.

The first form
of fsck_hfs quickly checks the specified file systems
to determine whether they were cleanly unmounted.

The second form
of fsck_hfs preens the specified file systems. It is
normally started by fsck(8) run from /etc/rc.boot
during automatic reboot, when a HFS file system is detected.
When preening file systems, fsck_hfs will fix common
inconsistencies for file systems that were not unmounted
cleanly. If more serious problems are found, fsck_hfs
does not try to fix them, indicates that it was not
successful, and exits.

The third form
of fsck_hfs checks the specified file systems and
tries to repair all detected inconsistencies.

If no options
are specified fsck_hfs will always check and attempt
to fix the specified file systems.

The options are
as follows:

&minus;d

Display debugging information.
This option may provide useful information when
fsck_hfs cannot repair a damaged file system.

&minus;f

When used with the
&minus;p option, force fsck_hfs to check
&rsquo;clean&rsquo; file systems, otherwise it means force
fsck_hfs to check and repair journaled HFS+ file
systems.

&minus;g

Causes fsck_hfs to
generate it&rsquo;s output strings in GUI format. This
option is used when another application with a graphical
user interface (like Mac OS X Disk Utility) is envoking the
fsck_hfs tool.

&minus;m mode

Mode is an octal number that
will be used to set the permissions for the lost+found
directory when it is created. The lost+found directory is
only created when a volume is repaired and orphaned files or
directories are detected. fsck_hfs places orphaned
files and directories into the lost+found directory (located
at the root of the volume). The default mode is 01777.

&minus;p

Preen the specified file
systems.

&minus;q

Causes fsck_hfs to
quickly check whether the volume was unmounted cleanly. If
the volume was unmounted cleanly, then the exit status is 0.
If the volume was not unmounted cleanly, then the exit
status will be non-zero. In either case, a message is
printed to standard output describing whether the volume was
clean or dirty.

&minus;y

Always attempt to repair any
damage that is found.

&minus;n

Never attempt to repair any
damage that is found.

&minus;r

Rebuild the catalog file on the
specified file system. This option currently will only work
if there is enough contiguous space on the specified file
system for a new catalog file and if there is no damage to
the leaf nodes in the existing catalog file.

Because of
inconsistencies between the block device and the buffer
cache, the raw device should always be used.

BUGS

fsck_hfs is not able to
fix some inconsistencies that it detects.
