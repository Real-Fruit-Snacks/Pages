LOCALTIME(5)                       localtime                      LOCALTIME(5)

NAME
       localtime - Local timezone configuration file

SYNOPSIS
       /etc/localtime -> ../usr/share/zoneinfo/...

DESCRIPTION
       The /etc/localtime file configures the system-wide timezone of the
       local system that is used by applications for presentation to the user.
       It should be an absolute or relative symbolic link pointing to
       /usr/share/zoneinfo/, followed by a timezone identifier such as
       "Europe/Berlin" or "Etc/UTC". The resulting link should lead to the
       corresponding binary tzfile(5) timezone data for the configured
       timezone.

       Because the timezone identifier is extracted from the symlink target
       name of /etc/localtime, this file may not be a normal file or hardlink.

       If /etc/localtime is missing, the default "UTC" timezone is used.

       The timezone may be overridden for individual programs by using the $TZ
       environment variable. See environ(7).

       You may use timedatectl(1) to change the settings of this file from the
       command line during runtime. Use systemd-firstboot(1) to initialize the
       time zone on mounted (but not booted) system images.
