DVD BACKGROUND

At a high
level, a DVD is a collection of menus and titles.
Conceptually, a menu contains buttons which can be assigned
actions and provides a list of choices to the end user,
while a title contains the main content of the DVD. However,
in reality many of the features available in menus
(including buttons, pausing, and looping) are also available
in titles.

The menus and
titles are divided into titlesets and the VMGM menu set. A
titleset can contain a number of menus and titles which are
meant to act together. The "menu",
"audio", "subtitle", and
"angle" buttons on the DVD player’s remote
control will all access menus in the same titleset as the
title which is being played. All the titles and menus of a
given titleset have the same video, audio, and subtitle
settings (the definitions for the menus are independent from
the definitions for the titles), so if you want to have
different settings (for example widescreen vs standard
aspect ratios), then you need separate titlesets. Titlesets
are not meant to jump to one another, so the VMGM menu
domain is used. It is a collection of menus (no titles) that
can access the menus and titles of all the titlesets.

One of the most
frustrating things when deciding how to author a DVD is that
there are often many ways to accomplish the same task. For
example, you must decide whether to locate menus at the VMGM
level or the titleset level. A typical setup is to locate
the high level menus at the VMGM level, and the low level
configuration menus (scene / audio / subtitle selection) at
the titleset. If there are DVD extras, perhaps with a lower
quality audio track and a 4:3 aspect ratio, then they would
be in a separate titleset with a menu to select among the
extras located at the titleset level.

DVDAUTHOR DESCRIPTION

dvdauthor
works in discrete operations. It authors each titleset one
at a time, and then finally authors the VMGM to complete the
disc. At that point the contents can be written out to a
DVD. If you are controlling dvdauthor with command
line arguments, then each step will occur independently;
however if you are using the XML control file, then you have
the option of combining some or all the steps into one.

The VOBs passed
to dvdauthor must have DVD NAV (VOBU) packets
multiplexed in at the correct locations. Many tools can do
this, including mplex from mjpegtools 1.6.0 or later.
dvdauthor will then fill these packets in with the
correct data. Special care has been taken to ensure
dvdauthor is fifo compliant; that is every source VOB
can be the output of another program (such as mplex).
This can make execution faster on many systems by avoiding
extra filesystem accesses.

COMMAND LINE DESCRIPTION

-o
output-dir 
-O output-dir

The destination directory to
store the DVD-Video file structure in. If -O is specified,
then any existing directory is (safely) deleted (only items
that look like part of a DVD-Video structure are
removed).

-x
xml-control-file

Specifies the control file
describing the output structure to create.

Note that the
remaining command-line options are deprecated. Use
the XML control file instead.

-j

--jumppad

Enables the creation of
jumppads, which allow greater flexibility in choosing
jump/call destinations.

-g

--allgprm

Enable the use of all 16
general purpose registers. Prohibits the use of jumppad and
some complex expressions that require temporary
registers.

-T

Creates the table of contents file instead of a
titleset. If this option is used, it should be listed first,
and you may not specify any titles.

-m

Creates a menu.

-t

Creates a title.

-v video-opts

--video=video-opts

A plus (+) separated list of
video options. Dvdauthor will try to infer any unspecified
options. pal, ntsc, 4:3, 16:9, 720xfull, 720x576, 720x480,
704xfull, 704x576, 704x480, 352xfull, 352x576, 352x480,
352xhalf, 352x288, 352x240, nopanscan, noletterbox, crop.
Default is 4:3, 720xfull

-a audio-opts

--audio=audio-opts

A plus (+) separated list of
options for an audio track, with each track separated by a
comma (,). For example -a ac3+en,mp2+de specifies two audio
tracks: the first is an English track encoded in AC3, the
second is a German track encoded using MPEG-1 layer 2
compression. ac3, mp2, pcm, dts, 16bps, 20bps, 24bps, drc,
surround, nolang, 1ch, 2ch, 3ch, 4ch, 5ch, 6ch, 7ch, 8ch,
and any two letter ISO 639 language abbreviation. Default is
1 track, mp2, 20bps, nolang, 2ch. ’ac3’ implies
drc, 6ch.

-s
subpicture-opts 
--subpictures=subpicture-opts

A plus (+) separated list of
options for a subpicture track, with each track separated by
a comma (,). nolang and any two letter language abbreviation
(see -a) Default is no subpicture tracks.

-e entry(s)

--entry=entry(s)

Makes the current menu the
default for certain circumstances. It is a comma separated
list of any of:

for TOC menus:
title

for VTS menus:
root, ptt, audio, subtitle, angle

-p palette-file

--palette=palette-file

Specifies where to get the
subpicture palette. Settable per title and per menu. If the
filename ends in .rgb (case insensitive) then it is assumed
to be RGB, otherwise it is YUV. Entries should be 6
hexadecimal digits. FILE defaults to
xste-palette.dat

-c chapterpts

--chapters=chapterpts

Specifies a comma (,) separated
list of chapter markers. Each marker is of the form
[[h:]mm:]ss[.frac] and is relative to the SCR of the next
file listed (independent of any timestamp transposing that
occurs within dvdauthor). The chapter markers ONLY apply to
the next file listed. Defaults to 0.

-f mpeg-file

--file=mpeg-file 
mpeg-file

Specifies either a file, a
pipe, or a shell command ending in | which supplies an
MPEG-2 system stream with VOB sectors inserted in the
appropriate places (using mplex -f 8 to generate)

-b buttondef

--button=X1xY1-X2xY2,commandlist

creates a button of the
specified size. See LANGUAGE DESCRIPTION for a description
of commandlist.

-i
[pre|post]=commandlist 
--instructions=[pre|post]=commandlist

Executes the commandlist
instructions either before or at the end of the menu/title.
See LANGUAGE DESCRIPTION for the format of
commandlist.

Initiates dvdauthor. dest
denotes the directory where dvdauthor will write the
files. This is overridden by the -o option. Contains up to
one  tag and any number of
’s.

Constructs of a VMGM level menu
set or a title set. Contains zero or more  tags
and if a titleset, up to one  tag.

language-code"]>

Marks a list of menus with a
common language for this VMGM menu set or titleset, called
in dvdauthor terminology a "pgcgroup."
Contains up to one  tag, up to one
 tag, up to one  tag, and any
number of  tags.

Marks the list of titles for
this titleset, called in dvdauthor terminology a
"pgcgroup." Contains up to one  tag,
up to eight  tags, up to 32 
tags, and any number of  tags.

XxY"] 
[caption="field1|field2"]

/>

Manually configures the video
parameters for this pgcgroup. If any of these are not set,
then they will be inferred from the source stream. Note that
the DVD format only specifically supports 720x480, 704x480,
352x480, and 352x240 resolutions for NTSC, and 720x576,
704x576, 352x576, and 352x288 resolutions for PAL, but DVD
author will accept a wider range of inputs and round up to
the nearest size.

/>

Manually configures an audio
stream for this pgcgroup. List once for each stream. Most
parameters are inferred automatically from the source VOBs
except for PCM parameters. However, language and content
must be manually specified. Note that it is possible to just
list the language and content attributes and let
dvdauthor fill in the rest.

Manually configures a
subpicture/subtitle for this pgcgroup or PGC. At the
pgcgroup level, list once for each language. Occurrences at
the PGC level don’t have lang or content attributes;
they inherit those from the corresponding 
tag at the pgcgroup level.

streamid" />

Specifies the ID of a stream
that is the representation of this subpicture in a
particular display mode. This can be specified per-PGC, or
pgcgroup-wide.

entries"]
[palette="yuvfile|rgbfile"] 
[pause="seconds|inf"]>

A PGC is just a fancy term for
either a menu or a title. It has a special meaning in the
DVD spec so I have retained its use here. PGC’s can
have commands that get executed before they start playing or
after they finish; see  and  tags
below.

If the PGC is a
menu, you can specify one or more entries for it. This means
that if you press the corresponding button on your DVD
remote, then it will go to this menu. For a VMGM level menu,
the only choice is title, which on my remote corresponds to
the top menu button. For a titleset level menu, you can use
root, subtitle, audio, angle, and ptt. If you want more than
one, separate them by a space or a comma. Note that root
entry is meant for commands that jump from a VMGM level menu
to a titleset menu.

If the PGC is
in a titleset, then it is assumed to be a title unless
entry="notitle" is specified.

All button and
menu masks and all subtitles within a PGC must share the
same 16 color palette. If you use spumux to generate
the subtitle/subpicture packets, then the color information
will be automatically passed to dvdauthor; however,
if you use another subtitler or want to have more control
over the palette, you can manually specify it with the
palette attribute. The first 16 entries of the file should
be the 16 colors of the palette, listed as 6 digit
hexadecimal numbers representing either the RGB breakdown
(if the filename ends in .rgb or the YUV breakdown (if the
filename does not end in .rgb. After that, the button group
information can be listed as pairs of 8 digit hexadecimal
numbers; up to three button groups may be specified.

If you have a
short video sequence or just want the video to pause at the
end, you can use the pause attribute to set the number of
seconds (as an integer) from 1 to 254. If you want the video
to pause indefinitely, use inf.

commands;  
 commands; 

Sets the commands to execute
before or after a PGC plays. It can be used to loop the
current video (by having a  jump ...
 sequence), or to conditionally skip certain
chapters if a flag has been set.

commands; 

Sets the commands to execute
when the disk is first put in the player (FPC = First
Program Chain). It can be used to jump to a particular menu
or initialize registers on startup. If not specified, an
implicit one will be created that jumps to the first menu
found, or if there is no menu it will jump to the first
title..

file.mpg"
[chapters="chapter-list"]
[pause="seconds|inf"] />

Specifies an input video file
for a menu or title, with optional chapter points and pause
at the end.

timestamp"]
[end="timestamp"]
[chapter="1|on|yes" | 
program="1|on|yes"]
[pause="seconds|inf"]>
commands; 

A more detailed way of
specifying marker points in a title. If present, then the
containing  must not have a chapters attribute. A
cell can have a VM command attached to it, to be executed
when it plays. If the program attribute is set, then this
cell will be a point that the user can skip to using the
prev/next buttons on their DVD player remote. If the chapter
attribute is set (implies program is set as well), then this
cell is also a chapter point.

buttonname"]>
commands; 

Specifies the commands to be
executed when the user selects the button with the specified
name. You define button names and placements with
spumux.

LANGUAGE DESCRIPTION

The language is
quite simple and roughly looks like C.

•

Statements are terminated with a semicolon.

•

Statements can span multiple lines.

•

Multiple statements can appear on one line.

•

Whitespace (space, tab, newlines) are not important,
except to separate keywords and identifiers.

•

C-style /* ... */ comments are allowed. Or you can use
XML comments 

VARIABLES

The DVD virtual machine processes 16 bit values. It supports
up to 16 general purpose registers; however dvdauthor
reserves 3 for internal use. Thus register 0-12 are
available for use and are referred to as g0 through g12.

There are also
24 system registers, which can be referred to as s0 through
s23. Not all of these can be set. Many of these have
mnemonic synonyms. 
audio (s1, rw)

Denotes the audio stream,
ranging from 0-7.

subtitle (s2, rw)

The subtitle track, ranging
from 0-31. If you want the subtitle to always be displayed,
then you should add 64 (i.e. choose 64-95). Simply selecting
the track (0-31) means that only the forced subtitles will
be displayed, whereas enabling the track (64-95) means that
all the subtitles will be displayed. This allows you to have
forced subtitles only for the parts of the movie where the
actors are speaking a foreign (to the viewer) language, but
still have normal subtitles for the hearing impaired. The
hearing impaired viewers would enable the track (64-95)
while the other viewers would just select the track (0-31)
they would be able to share the track.

angle (s3, rw)

Selects the angle (currently
untested).

button (s8, rw)

Denotes the currently
highlighted button. Note that the value is multiplied by
1024, so the first button is 1024, the second is 2048,
etc.

EXPRESSIONS

Expressions follow typical C syntax except that booleans are
not convertible to integers and vice versa. Operators and
comparisons are:

==, !=, >=,
>, 

Since the code
is encapsulated in XML, the parser will catch any unescaped
 section.

There is also a
numerical function: 
random(EXPRESSION)

Computes a pseudo-random
number, between 1 and the supplied number, inclusively.

BLOCKS

Blocks are either a single statement (terminated by a
semicolon), or a group of statements wrapped in curly
braces. For example:

•

g3 = s7;

•

{

audio = 1; 
subtitle = 65; 
jump vmgm menu 3; 
}

STATEMENTS

The statements supported are fairly simple at the moment.

VARIABLE = EXPRESSION;

Sets a variable equal to the
result of an equation.

if
(EXPRESSION) BLOCK; 
if (EXPRESSION) BLOCK; else
BLOCK;

Calculates the expression; if
true, then it executes the block of code.

jump TARGET;

call TARGET [resume CELL]; 
resume;

Jumps to a particular title or
menu, or calls a particular menu, or returns to the calling
title. You can only execute a call from a title to a menu;
all other forms are illegal. The purpose of using call
instead of jump (besides the fact that they support a
mutually exclusive list of targets) is to allow the menu to
return to the point in the title where the call originated
using resume. You can manually specify the return cell by
using the resume keyword, however if you do not specify one
and you use the command in a post instruction block, then it
will presume cell 1.

TARGETS

The following are possible targets (note that menus do not
have chapters): 
[vmgm | titleset X] menu 
[vmgm | titleset X] menu Y 
[vmgm | titleset X] menu entry
Z

Targets either the default
menu, a menu number Y, or the menu denoted as the entry for
Z. The menu is in either the VMGM or titleset domain. If you
wish to target a menu in the current domain then you can
omit the domain moniker.

[titleset X]
title Y [chapter Z]

Targets a title, or a chapter
in a title. Numbering starts at 1. All of the titles on the
disc are accessible in the VMGM domain, or you can access
them by titleset instead.

pgc Z

Targets a PGC in the current VMGM or titleset.

chapter Z

Targets a chapter in the
current title.

program Z

cell Z

Targets a program or cell in the current PGC. You can
use this to create looping menus: jump cell 1;

cell top 
next cell 
prev cell 
program top 
next program 
prev program 
pgc top 
next pgc 
prev pgc

up pgc

pgc tail

(Jump only) performs relative
transfers of control within the current menu/title.
"cell/program/pgc top" goes back to the start of
the current cell/program/PGC; "next/prev
cell/program/pgc" goes to the next or previous
cell/program/PGC; "up pgc" goes to the
"up" PGC (not currently settable in
dvdauthor); and "pgc tail" goes to the
 sequence in the current PGC.

Chapters are
numbered from 1 in each title, while programs are numbered
from 1 in each PGC. Thus, the latter can reset independently
of the former when there is more than one PGC in a
title.

LIMITATIONS

The following
limits are imposed by the DVD-Video spec.

There can be no
more than 99 titlesets, no more than 99 menus in the VMG or
a titleset, and no more than 99 titles in a titleset.

Each title may
be made up of up to 999 PGCs. Each PGC may consist of up to
255 programs. The  and  sections of a
PGC put together can contain no more than 128 VM
instructions.

Since there is
only one VOB file (VIDEO_TS.VOB) in the VMG, the total
amount of video in the VMG menus must fit into 1073709056
bytes (524272 sectors of 2kiB each). In each titleset, all
the menu video must fit in the first VOB (VTS_nn_0.VOB), so
is limited to the same amount. marc.leeman [AT] gmail.com>
