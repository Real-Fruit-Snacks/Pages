NAME

ppmtoicr -
convert a PPM image into NCSA ICR format

SYNOPSIS

ppmtoicr

[-windowname
name]

[-expand
expand]

[-display
display]

[ppmfile]

Minimum unique
abbreviation of option is acceptable. You may use double
hyphens instead of single hyphen to denote options. You may
use white space in place of the equals sign to separate an
option name from its value.

DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

ppmtoicr
reads a PPM file as input. Produces an NCSA Telnet
Interactive Color Raster graphic file as output.

If
ppmfile is not supplied, ppmtoicr reads from
Standard Input.

Interactive
Color Raster (ICR) is a protocol for displaying raster
graphics on workstation screens. The protocol is implemented
in NCSA Telnet for the Macintosh version 2.3. The ICR
protocol shares characteristics of the Tektronix graphics
terminal emulation protocol. For example, escape sequences
are used to control the display.

ppmtoicr
will output the appropriate sequences to create a window of
the dimensions of the input image, create a colormap of up
to 256 colors on the display, then load the picture data
into the window.

Note that there
is no icrtoppm tool - this transformation is one way.

OPTIONS

In addition to
the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most
notably -quiet, see
 Common Options ),
ppmtoicr recognizes the following command line
options: 
-windowname name

Output will be displayed in
name.

name
must be printable characters, and not ’^’.

Default is to
use the input file name if specified on the command line or

"untitled" if the input is from Standard Input. In
the former case, any 
unprintable character or ’^’ in the file name
becomes a 
’.’ in the window name.

-expand
expand

Output will be expanded on
display by factor expand (For example, a value of 2
will cause four pixels to be displayed for every input
pixel.)

-display
display

Output will be displayed on
screen numbered display

EXAMPLES

To display a
PPM file named ppmfile using the protocol:

ppmtoicr
ppmfile

This will
create a window named ppmfile on the display with the
correct dimensions for ppmfile, create and download a
colormap of up to 256 colors, and download the picture into
the window. You may achieve the same effect with the
following sequence:

ppmtoicr
ppmfile > filename 
cat filename

To display a
GIF file using the protocol in a window titled after the
input file, zoom the displayed image by a factor of 2:

giftopnm
giffile | ppmtoicr -windowname=giffile -expand=2

LIMITATIONS

The protocol
uses frequent fflush() calls to speed up display. If you
save the output to a file for later display via cat,
ppmtoicr will draw much more slowly. In either case,
increasing the blocksize limit on the display will speed up
transmission substantially.

HISTORY

Until Netpbm
10.71 (June 2015), there was a -rle option
documented, which was said to cause the output to use run
length encoding compression. But because of a simple bug in
option processing code, the option never had any effect. And
the compression code did not look like it worked anyway and
would take a fair amount of work to fix. Because it was
unlikely anyone would ever use this program again, much less
want to use run length encoding, we removed it from the
documentation rather than fix the code.
