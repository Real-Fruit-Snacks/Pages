NAME

sq pki certify
- Certify a User ID for a Certificate

SYNOPSIS

sq pki
certify [OPTIONS] CERTIFIER-KEY
KEY_ID|FINGERPRINT|FILE USERID

DESCRIPTION

Certify a User
ID for a Certificate.

Using a
certification a keyholder may vouch for the fact that
another certificate legitimately belongs to a user id. In
the context of emails this means that the same entity
controls the key and the email address. These kind of
certifications form the basis for the Web of Trust.

This command
emits the certificate with the new certification. The
updated certificate has to be distributed, preferably by
sending it to the certificate holder for attestation. See
also ’sq key attest-certifications’.

By default a
certification expires after 5 years. Using the
’--expiry’ argument specific validity periods
may be defined. It allows for providing a point in time for
validity to end or a validity duration.

’sq pki
certify’ respects the reference time set by the
top-level ’--time’ argument. It sets the
certification’s creation time to the reference
time.

OPTIONS

Subcommand
options 
-B, --binary

Emit binary data

-a,
--amount=AMOUNT

Set the amount of trust. Values
between 1 and 120 are meaningful. 120 means fully trusted.
Values less than 120 indicate the degree of trust. 60 is
usually used for partially trusted.

--add-userid

Add the given user ID if it
doesn’t exist in the certificate.

--allow-not-alive-certifier

Allow the key to make a
certification even if the current time is prior to its
creation time or the current time is at or after its
expiration time.

--allow-revoked-certifier

Don’t fail if the
certificate making the certification is revoked.

-d,
--depth=TRUST_DEPTH

Set the trust depth (sometimes
referred to as the trust level). 0 means a normal
certification of . 1 means
CERTIFICATE is also a trusted introducer, 2 means
CERTIFICATE is a meta-trusted introducer, etc.

--email

Treat the given user ID as an
email address. If more than one user ID contain the given
email address, all are certified.

--expiry=EXPIRY

Define EXPIRY for the
certification as ISO 8601 formatted string or custom
duration. If an ISO 8601 formatted string is provided, the
validity period reaches from the reference time (may be set
using ’--time’) to the provided time. Custom
durations starting from the reference time may be set using
’N[ymwds]’, for N years, months, weeks, days, or
seconds. The special keyword ’never’ sets an
unlimited expiry.

-l, --local

Make the certification a local
certification. Normally, local certifications are not
exported.

--non-revocable

Mark the certification as being
non-revocable. That is, you cannot later revoke this
certification. This should normally only be used with an
expiration.

--notation NAME
VALUE

Add a notation to the
certification. A user-defined notation’s name must be
of the form ’name [AT] a.org’. If
the notation’s name starts with a !, then the notation
is marked as being critical. If a consumer of a signature
doesn’t understand a critical notation, then it will
ignore the signature. The notation is marked as being human
readable.

-o,
--output=FILE

Write to FILE or stdout if
omitted

--private-key-store=KEY_STORE

Provide parameters for private
key store

-r,
--regex=REGEX

Add a regular expression to
constrain what a trusted introducer can certify. The regular
expression must match the certified User ID in all
intermediate introducers, and the certified certificate.
Multiple regular expressions may be specified. In that case,
at least one must match.

CERTIFIER-KEY

Create the certification using
CERTIFIER-KEY.

KEY_ID|FINGERPRINT|FILE
