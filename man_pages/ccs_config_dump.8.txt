NAME

ccs_config_dump
&minus; Tool to generate XML output of running
configuration.

SYNOPSIS

ccs_config_dump
[OPTION]..

DESCRIPTION

ccs_config_dump
is part of the Cluster Configuration System (CCS). It is
used to dump the current running configuration in XML
format. The running configuration is, sometimes, different
from the stored configuration on file or ldap because some
subsystems store or set some default information into the
configuration. Those values are generally not present on the
on-disk version of the configuration but are required at
runtime for the cluster to work properly.

OPTIONS

&minus;h

Help. Print out the usage.

&minus;V

Print the version information.

&minus;r

Force config dump from running cluster. This option is
only for expert users and debugging sessions. Don&rsquo;t
use it for random purposes. ccs_config_dump can be
configured to use different configuration sources via
environment variables. This option will clear them to use
the default and use only the runtime configuration.
