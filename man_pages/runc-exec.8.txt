NAME

runc-exec
- execute new process inside the container

SYNOPSIS

runc
exec [option ...] container-id [--]
command [arg ...]

runc
exec [option ...] -p process.json
container-id

OPTIONS

--console-socket
path

Path to an AF_UNIX
socket which will receive a file descriptor referencing the
master end of the console’s pseudoterminal. See
docs/terminals ⟨
https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/blob/master/docs/terminals.md⟩
.

--cwd path

Change to path in the
container before executing the command.

--env|-e
name=value

Set an environment variable
name to value. Can be specified multiple
times.

--tty|-t

Allocate a pseudo-TTY.

--user|-u
uid[:gid]

Run the command as a
user (and, optionally, group) specified by uid (and
gid).

--additional-gids|-g
gid

Add additional group IDs. Can
be specified multiple times.

--process|-p
process.json

Instead of specifying all the
exec parameters directly on the command line, get them from
a process.json, a JSON file containing the process
specification as defined by the OCI runtime spec ⟨
https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec/blob/master/config.md#process⟩
.

--detach|-d

Detach from the
container’s process.

--pid-file
path

Specify the file to write the
container process’ PID to.

--process-label
label

Set the asm process label for
the process commonly used with selinux(7).

--apparmor
profile

Set the apparmor(7)
profile for the process.

--no-new-privs

Set the "no new
privileges" value for the process.

--cap cap

Add a capability to the
bounding set for the process. Can be specified multiple
times.

--preserve-fds
N

Pass N additional file
descriptors to the container (stdio +
$LISTEN_FDS + N in total). Default is
0.

--ignore-paused

Allow exec in a paused
container. By default, if a container is paused, runc
exec errors out; this option can be used to override it.
A paused container needs to be resumed for the exec to
complete.

--cgroup path |
controller[,controller...]:path

Execute a process in a
sub-cgroup. If the specified cgroup does not exist, an error
is returned. Default is empty path, which means to use
container’s top level cgroup.

For cgroup v1
only, a particular controller (or multiple
comma-separated controllers) can be specified, and the
option can be used multiple times to set different paths for
different controllers.

Note for cgroup
v2, in case the process can’t join the top level
cgroup, runc exec fallback is to try joining the
cgroup of container’s init. This fallback can be
disabled by using --cgroup /.

EXIT STATUS

Exits with a
status of command (unless -d is used), or
255 if an error occurred.

EXAMPLES

If the
container can run ps(1) command, the following will
output a list of processes running in the container:

# runc exec
 ps
