PTY(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual PTY(4)

NAME

pty â€” BSD-style and
System V-style compatibility pseudo-terminal driver

SYNOPSIS

device pty

DESCRIPTION

The pty driver provides
support for the traditional BSD naming scheme that was used
for accessing pseudo-terminals. When the device
/dev/ptyXX is being opened, a new terminal shall be
created with the pts(4) driver. A device node for this
terminal shall be created, which has the name
/dev/ttyXX.

The pty
driver also provides a cloning System V /dev/ptmx
device.

New code should
not try to allocate pseudo-terminals using this interface.
It is only provided for compatibility with older C libraries
that tried to open such devices when posix_openpt(2) was
being called.

FILES

The BSD-style compatibility
pseudo-terminal driver uses the following device names:

/dev/pty[l-sL-S][0-9a-v]

Pseudo-terminal
master devices.

/dev/tty[l-sL-S][0-9a-v]

Pseudo-terminal
slave devices.

/dev/ptmx

Control device,
returns a file descriptor to a new master pseudo-terminal
when opened.

DIAGNOSTICS

None.

SEE ALSO

posix_openpt(2), pts(4),
tty(4)

HISTORY

A pseudo-terminal driver
appeared in 4.2BSD.

BUGS

Unlike previous implementations,
the master and slave device nodes are destroyed when the PTY
becomes unused. A call to stat(2) on a nonexistent master
device will already cause a new master device node to be
created. The master device can only be destroyed by opening
and closing it.

The pty
driver cannot be unloaded, because it cannot determine if it
is being used.
