NAME

ypserv.conf -
configuration file for ypserv and rpc.ypxfrd

DESCRIPTION

ypserv.conf
is an ASCII file which contains some options for ypserv. It
also contains a list of rules for special host and map
access for ypserv and rpc.ypxfrd. This file will be read by
ypserv and rpc.ypxfrd at startup, or when receiving a SIGHUP
signal.

There is one
entry per line. If the line is a option line, the format
is:

option:
argument

The line for an
access rule has the format:

host:domain:map:security

All rules are
tried one by one. If no match is found, access to a map is
allowed.

Following
options exist:

files:
30

This option specifies, how many
database files should be cached by ypserv. If 0 is
specified, caching is disabled. Decreasing this number is
only possible, if ypserv is restarted.

trusted_master:
server

If this option is set on a
slave server, new maps from the host server will be
accepted as master. The default is, that no trusted master
is set and new maps will not be accepted.

Example:

trusted_master:
ypmaster.example.org

slp:
[yes||domain]

If this option is enabled and
SLP support compiled in, the NIS server registers itself on
a SLP server. If the variable is set to domain, an
attribute domain with a comma seperated list of
supported domainnames is set. Else this attribute will not
be set. The default is "no" (disabled).

xfr_check_port:
[|no]

With this option enabled, the
NIS master server have to run on a port 

The field
descriptions for the access rule lines are:

host

IPv4 only address. Wildcards
are allowed. This rules are ignored for IPv6, which means it
is better to not use this option at all anymore.

Examples:

131.234. =
131.234.0.0/255.255.0.0 
131.234.214.0/255.255.254.0

domain

specifies the domain, for which
this rule should be applied. An asterix as wildcard is
allowed.

map

name of the map, or asterisk
for all maps.

security

one of none,
port, deny:

none

always allow access.

port

allow access if from port 

deny

deny access to this map.

FILES

/etc/ypserv.conf

WARNINGS

The access
rules for special maps are no real improvement in security,
but they make the life a little bit harder for a potential
hacker.

Solaris clients
don't use privileged ports. All security options which
depend on privileged ports cause big problems on Solaris
clients.
