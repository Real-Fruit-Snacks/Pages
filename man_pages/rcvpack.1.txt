NAME

rcvpack -
append an email from standard input to a file

SYNOPSIS

/usr/lib/mh/rcvpack

[-help] [-version]
file [-mbox] [-mmdf]

DESCRIPTION

rcvpack
appends a copy of a message to the file specified on its
command line.

If the
-mbox switch is given (the default), messages are
separated by mbox (uucp) style delimiters. This is the
format used by most mail clients (elm, mailx, etc.).

Alternatively,
if the -mmdf switch is given, messages are separated
by mmdf style delimiters, each message being separated by
four CTRL-Aâ€™s and a newline.

rcvpack
will correctly lock and unlock the file to serialize access
when running multiple copies of rcvpack.

In general,
rcvpack has been rendered obsolete by the file
action of slocal, although it may still have some use
in shell scripts.

FILES

/etc/nmh/mts.conf
