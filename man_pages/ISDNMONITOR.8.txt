ISDNMONITOR(8) BSD System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
ISDNMONITOR(8)

NAME

isdnmonitor &mdash;
isdn4bsd / isdnd remote monitoring tool

SYNOPSIS

isdnmonitor
[&minus;c] [&minus;d debuglevel]
[&minus;f filename]
[&minus;h hostspec]
[&minus;l pathname]
[&minus;p portspec]

DESCRIPTION

The isdnmonitor utility
is used to remotely monitor the operation of the isdn
daemon, isdnd(8), which manages all ISDN related connection
and disconnection of ISDN devices supported by the isdn4bsd
package.

The options are
as follows:

&minus;c

Switch to
(curses-) fullscreen mode of operation. In this mode,
isdnmonitor behaves nearly exactly as isdnd(8) in
fullscreen mode. In fullscreen mode, entering the control
character Control-L causes the display to be
refreshed and entering Carriage-Return or
Enter will pop-up a command window. Because
isdnmonitor will not listen to messages while the
command window is active, this command window will disappear
automatically after 5 seconds without any command key
press.

While the
command window is active, Tab or Space
advances to the next menu item. To execute a command, press
Return or Enter for the highlighted menu item,
or enter the number corresponding to the item to be executed
or enter the capitalized character in the menu item
description.

&minus;d

If debugging
support is compiled into isdnmonitor this option is
used to specify the debugging level.

In addition,
this option accepts also the character &rsquo;n&rsquo; as an
argument to disable displaying debug messages on the
full-screen display.

&minus;f

Specifying this
option causes isdnmonitor to write its normal output
and - if enabled - debugging output to a file which name is
specified as the argument.

&minus;l

is used to
specify a Unix local domain socket name to be used for
communication between isdnd(8) and isdnmonitor.

&minus;h

is used to
specify a hostname or a dotted-quad IP address of a machine
where an isdnd(8) is running which should be monitored.

&minus;p

This option may
be used to specify a remote port number in conjunction with
the &minus;h option.

ENVIRONMENT

The following environment
variables affect the execution of isdnmonitor:

TERM

The terminal
type when running in full-screen display mode. See
environ(7) for more information.

EXAMPLES

For a first try, the following
command should be used to start isdnmonitor to
monitor a locally running isdnd:

isdnmonitor -h
localhost

DIAGNOSTICS

Exit status is 0 on success, 1
on error.
