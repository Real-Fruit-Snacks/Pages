NAME

display-monotext
: Emulate palettized modes on text-mode visuals

SYNOPSIS

display-monotext:
[ [-a=] | [ [-x=] [-y=] ] ]

DESCRIPTION

Emulates
palettized modes (GT_PALETTE) on another target which
can only do text modes, by representing the graphics as
ASCII characters. The effect is the much the same as the
AAlib target, but does not depend on any external
libraries.

OPTIONS

-x=,
-y=

A value between 1 and 5 which
determines how accurately to map the graphics to ASCII
characters. Lower values are less accurate, but can
represent a wider range of intensity levels. The default is
x=2 and y=4.

-a=

Same as above, but sets both
the x and y accuracy to the specified value.
