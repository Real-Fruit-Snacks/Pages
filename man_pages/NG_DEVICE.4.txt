NG_DEVICE(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual
NG_DEVICE(4)

NAME

ng_device â€” device
netgraph node type

SYNOPSIS

#include

DESCRIPTION

A device node is both a
netgraph node and a system device interface. When a
device node is created, a new device entry appears
which is accessible via the regular file operators such as
open(2), close(2), read(2), write(2), etc.

The first node
is created as /dev/ngd0, all subsequent nodes
/dev/ngd1, /dev/ngd2, etc.

HOOKS

A device node has a
single hook with an arbitrary name. All data coming in over
the hook will be presented to the device for read(2). All
data coming in from the device entry by write(2) will be
forwarded to the hook.

CONTROL MESSAGES

The device node supports
one non-generic control message:

NGM_DEVICE_GET_DEVNAME

Returns device name
corresponding to a node.

SHUTDOWN

This node shuts down upon
receipt of a NGM_SHUTDOWN control message, or upon hook
disconnection. The associated device entry is removed and
becomes available for use by future device nodes.

SEE ALSO

netgraph(4), ngctl(8)

HISTORY

The device node type was
first implemented in FreeBSD 5.0.
