LOG1P(3POSIX)              POSIX Programmer's Manual             LOG1P(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       log1p, log1pf, log1pl — compute a natural logarithm

SYNOPSIS
       #include <math.h>

       double log1p(double x);
       float log1pf(float x);
       long double log1pl(long double x);

DESCRIPTION
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with  the
       ISO C  standard.  Any  conflict between the requirements described here
       and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017
       defers to the ISO C standard.

       These functions shall compute loge(1.0 + x).

       An  application  wishing to check for error situations should set errno
       to zero and  call  feclearexcept(FE_ALL_EXCEPT)  before  calling  these
       functions. On return, if errno is non-zero or fetestexcept(FE_INVALID |
       FE_DIVBYZERO | FE_OVERFLOW | FE_UNDERFLOW) is non-zero,  an  error  has
       occurred.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon  successful  completion,  these functions shall return the natural
       logarithm of 1.0 + x.

       If x is -1, a  pole  error  shall  occur  and  log1p(),  log1pf(),  and
       log1pl()  shall  return  -HUGE_VAL, -HUGE_VALF, and -HUGE_VALL, respec‐
       tively.

       For finite values of x that are less than -1, or if x is -Inf, a domain
       error  shall  occur, and either a NaN (if supported), or an implementa‐
       tion-defined value shall be returned.

       If x is NaN, a NaN shall be returned.

       If x is ±0, or +Inf, x shall be returned.

       If x is subnormal, a range error may occur
       and x should be returned.

       If x is not returned, log1p(), log1pf(), and log1pl() shall  return  an
       implementation-defined  value  no  greater  in  magnitude than DBL_MIN,
       FLT_MIN, and LDBL_MIN, respectively.

ERRORS
       These functions shall fail if:

       Domain Error
                   The finite value of x is less than -1, or x is -Inf.

                   If the integer expression (math_errhandling  &  MATH_ERRNO)
                   is non-zero, then errno shall be set to [EDOM].  If the in‐
                   teger expression  (math_errhandling  &  MATH_ERREXCEPT)  is
                   non-zero,  then  the invalid floating-point exception shall
                   be raised.

       Pole Error  The value of x is -1.

                   If the integer expression (math_errhandling  &  MATH_ERRNO)
                   is  non-zero,  then errno shall be set to [ERANGE].  If the
                   integer expression (math_errhandling &  MATH_ERREXCEPT)  is
                   non-zero,  then the divide-by-zero floating-point exception
                   shall be raised.

       These functions may fail if:

       Range Error The value of x is subnormal.

                   If the integer expression (math_errhandling  &  MATH_ERRNO)
                   is  non-zero,  then errno shall be set to [ERANGE].  If the
                   integer expression (math_errhandling &  MATH_ERREXCEPT)  is
                   non-zero, then the underflow floating-point exception shall
                   be raised.

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       On error, the expressions (math_errhandling & MATH_ERRNO) and (math_er‐
       rhandling & MATH_ERREXCEPT) are independent of each other, but at least
       one of them must be non-zero.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
