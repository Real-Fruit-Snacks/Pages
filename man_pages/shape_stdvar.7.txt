NAME

shape_stdvar -
shapeTools RMS project wide variant definitions

DESCRIPTION

This file
contains common variant definitions to be used in a software
development project supported by the shape release
management system. The stdvar file defines a variant raster
for a whole development project. This central definition
facility unifies the naming and semantics of supported
system variants.

Stdvar
is to be included into the Shapefiles of any part of the
developed system via shape&rsquo;s include mechanism. The
definitions in stdvar should be carefully designed and
maintained for each supported project. They usually concern
variant control for all hardware/operating system platforms
to be supported or variant settings to produce different
qualities of generated code (debug or optimized).

Enclosed in the
shapeTools distribution, you find the stdvar file used in
the development of the shape toolkit itself. This may be a
good starting point for developing an own variant raster. At
least, it helps you learning the definition syntax.
Otherwise, for a description on the syntax of variant
definition parts see the shape(1) manual.
