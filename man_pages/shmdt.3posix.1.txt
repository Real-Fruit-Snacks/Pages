SHMDT(3POSIX)              POSIX Programmer's Manual             SHMDT(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       shmdt — XSI shared memory detach operation

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/shm.h>

       int shmdt(const void *shmaddr);

DESCRIPTION
       The shmdt() function operates on XSI shared memory (see the Base  Defi‐
       nitions  volume  of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 3.346, Shared Memory Object).
       It is unspecified whether this function interoperates with the realtime
       interprocess communication facilities defined in Section 2.8, Realtime.

       The  shmdt() function detaches the shared memory segment located at the
       address specified by shmaddr from the  address  space  of  the  calling
       process.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon  successful  completion,  shmdt()  shall  decrement  the  value of
       shm_nattch in the data structure associated with the shared  memory  ID
       of the attached shared memory segment and return 0. Also, the shm_dtime
       timestamp shall be set to the current time,  as  described  in  Section
       2.7.1, IPC General Description.

       Otherwise,  the  shared  memory  segment shall not be detached, shmdt()
       shall return -1, and errno shall be set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The shmdt() function shall fail if:

       EINVAL The value of shmaddr is not the data segment start address of  a
              shared memory segment.

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       The  POSIX Realtime Extension defines alternative interfaces for inter‐
       process communication. Application  developers  who  need  to  use  IPC
       should design their applications so that modules using the IPC routines
       described in Section 2.7, XSI Interprocess Communication can be  easily
       modified to use the alternative interfaces.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
