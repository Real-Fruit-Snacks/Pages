NAME

pnmsplit -
replaced by pamsplit

DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

Starting with
Netpbm 10.31 (December 2005), pnmsplit is obsolete.
Use pamsplit(1) instead.

pamsplit
is backward compatible with pnmsplit. You can use the
pamsplit manual for pnmsplit as long as you
ignore features that were added after Netpbm 10.30.
