NAME
       pnmsplit - replaced by pamsplit

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       Starting  with Netpbm 10.31 (December 2005), pnmsplit is obsolete.  Use
       pamsplit(1) instead.

       pamsplit is backward compatible with pnmsplit.  You can  use  the  pam‐
       split  manual  for  pnmsplit  as  long as you ignore features that were
       added after Netpbm 10.30.
