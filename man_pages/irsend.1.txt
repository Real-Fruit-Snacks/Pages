irsend -
basic LIRC program to send infra-red commands

SYNOPSIS

irsend
[options] send_once 
 [code...] 
irsend [options] send_start 

irsend [options] send_stop 

irsend [options] list 

irsend [options] set_transmitters 
[num...] 
irsend [options] simulate 

DESCRIPTION

Asks the
lircd daemon to send one or more CIR (Consumer
Infra-Red) commands. This is intended for remote control of
electronic devices such as TV boxes, HiFi sets, etc.

irsend
supports six sub-commands: 
send_once - send one or more code(s) once 
send_start - start repeating a code. 
send_stop - stop repeating code. 
list - list configured remote items 
set_transmitters - set active transmitters 
simulate - simulate IR event

remote
is the name of a remote, as described in the lircd
configuration file.

code is
the name of a remote control key of remote, as it
appears in the lircd.conf configuration file.

num is
the transmitter number of the hardware device.

For the
list command, remote and/or code can be
empty:

list
"" "" - list all configured remote names

list remote "" - list all codes of
remote 
list remote code - list only code of
remote

The
simulate command only works if it has been explicitly
enabled in lircd using the --allow-simulate option. The
required button press packet should formatted as a
socket broadcast message documented in lircd(8).

OPTIONS

-h
--help

Display usage summary.

-v --version

Display version.

-d
--device=device

Use given lircd socket
[/var/run/lirc/lircd].

-a
--address=host[:port]

Connect to lircd at this
address.

-# --count=n

Send command n times.

ENVIRONMENT

LIRC_SOCKET_PATH

The lircd socket to connect to,
defaults to a hardcoded default value
/var/run/lirc/lircd

FILES

/etc/lirc/lircd.conf

Default lircd
configuration file. It should contain all the remotes, their
infra-red codes and the corresponding timing and waveform
details.

DIAGNOSTICS

If lircd
is not running (or /var/run/lirc/lircd lacks write
permissions) irsend aborts with the following
diagnostics: 
"irsend: could not connect to socket" 
"irsend: Connection refused" (or "Permission
denied").

EXAMPLES

irsend LIST
DenonTuner "" 
irsend SEND_ONCE DenonTuner PROG-SCAN 
irsend SEND_ONCE OnkyoAmpli VOL-UP VOL-UP VOL-UP VOL-UP 
irsend SEND_START OnkyoAmpli VOL-DOWN ; sleep 3 
irsend SEND_STOP OnkyoAmpli VOL-DOWN 
irsend SET_TRANSMITTERS 1 
irsend SET_TRANSMITTERS 1 3 4 
irsend SIMULATE "0000000000000476 00 OK
TECHNISAT_ST3004S"

DRIVER LOADING

Drivers are
loaded dynamically. The directory used for this is
determined by (falling priority):

-

The environment variable LIRC_PLUGINDIR.

-

The ’plugindir’ entry in the [lircd] section
of the lirc_options.conf file.

-

A hardcoded default
(/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/lirc/plugins).
