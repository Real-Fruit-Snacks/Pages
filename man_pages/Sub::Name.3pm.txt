NAME
       Sub::Name - (Re)name a sub

VERSION
       version 0.26

SYNOPSIS
           use Sub::Name;

           subname $name, $subref;

           $subref = subname foo => sub { ... };

DESCRIPTION
       This module has only one function, which is also exported by default:

   subname NAME, CODEREF
       Assigns a new name to referenced sub.  If package specification is
       omitted in the name, then the current package is used.  The return
       value is the sub.

       The name is only used for informative routines (caller, Carp, etc).
       You won't be able to actually invoke the sub by the given name.  To
       allow that, you need to do glob-assignment yourself.

       Note that for anonymous closures (subs that reference lexicals declared
       outside the sub itself) you can name each instance of the closure
       differently, which can be very useful for debugging.

SEE ALSO
       •   Sub::Identify - for getting information about subs

       •   Sub::Util - set_subname is another implementation of "subname"
