NAME

mkcephfs
− create a ceph file system

SYNOPSIS

mkcephfs
[ −a ] [ −c ceph.conf ] [
−−clobber_old_data ] [
−−mkbtrfs ]

DESCRIPTION

mkcephfs
is used to create an empty Ceph file system, possibly
spanning multiple hosts. The ceph.conf file describes
the composition of the Ceph cluster, including which hosts
are participating, which daemons run where, and which paths
are used to store file system data or metadata.

OPTIONS

−a,
−−allhosts

Performs the necessary
initialization steps on all hosts in the cluster, executing
commands via SSH.

−c
ceph.conf,
−−conf=ceph.conf

Use the given conf file instead
of the default /etc/ceph/ceph.conf.

−−clobber_old_data

Overwrite any existing data
found in monitor or osd paths.

−−mkbtrfs

Create and mount the any btrfs
file systems specified in the ceph.conf for OSD data
storage using mkfs.btrfs. The "btrfs devs"
and (if it differs from "osd data") "btrfs
path" options must be defined.

AVAILABILITY

mkcephfs
is part of the Ceph distributed file system. Please refer to
the Ceph wiki at http://ceph.newdream.net/wiki for more
information.
