NAME

slapo-pbind -
proxy bind overlay to slapd

SYNOPSIS

/etc/ldap/slapd.conf

DESCRIPTION

The
pbind overlay to slapd(8) forwards Simple
Binds on a local database to a remote LDAP server instead of
processing them locally. The remote connection is managed
using an instance of the ldap backend.

The
pbind overlay uses a subset of the ldap
backend&rsquo;s config directives. They are described in
more detail in slapd-ldap(5).

Note: this
overlay is built into the ldap backend; it is not a
separate module. 
overlay pbind

This directive adds the proxy
bind overlay to the current backend. The proxy bind overlay
may be used with any backend, but it is mainly intended for
use with local storage backends.
