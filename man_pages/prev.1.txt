NAME

prev - show the
previous nmh message

SYNOPSIS

prev

[-help] [-version]
[+folder] [-showproc program]
[-showmimeproc program] [-header |
-noheader] [-checkmime | -nocheckmime]
[switches for showproc or
showmimeproc] 

DESCRIPTION

prev
performs a show on the previous message in the
specified (or current) folder. Like show, it passes
any switches on to the program named by showproc or
showmimeproc, which is called to list the message.
This command is almost exactly equivalent to “show
prev”. Consult the manual entry for show(1)
for all the details.

FILES

$HOME/.mh_profile
The user profile

PROFILE COMPONENTS

Path: To
determine the user’s nmh directory 
Current-Folder: To find the default current folder 
showproc: Program to show non-MIME messages 
showmimeproc: Program to show MIME messages

SEE ALSO

next(1),
show(1)

DEFAULTS

’+folder’
defaults to the current folder 
’-checkmime’ 
’-header’

CONTEXT

If a folder is
specified, it will become the current folder. The message
that is shown (i.e., the previous message in sequence) will
become the current message.

BUGS

prev is
really a link to the show program. As a result, if
you make a link to prev and that link is not called
prev, your link will act like show instead. To
circumvent this, add a profile-entry for the link to your
nmh profile and add the argument prev to the
entry.
