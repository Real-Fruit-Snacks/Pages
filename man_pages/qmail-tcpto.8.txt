print TCP timeout table

SYNOPSIS

qmail-tcpto

DESCRIPTION

After an SMTP
connection attempt times out, qmail-remote records
the relevant IP address. If the same address fails again
(after at least two minutes with no intervening successful
connections), qmail-remote assumes that further
attempts will fail for at least another hour.

qmail-tcpto
prints qmail-remoteâ€™s current list of
timeouts.

qmail-tcpto
must be run either as root or with user id
qmailr and group id qmail.
