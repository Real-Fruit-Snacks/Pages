NAME
       ethers - Ethernet address to IP number database

DESCRIPTION
       /etc/ethers  contains 48 bit Ethernet addresses and their corresponding
       IP numbers, one line for each IP number:

              Ethernet-address  IP-number

       The two items are separated by any number of SPACE and/or  TAB  charac‐
       ters.  A # at the beginning of a line starts a comment which extends to
       the end of the line.  The Ethernet-address is written  as  x:x:x:x:x:x,
       where  x  is a hexadecimal number between 0 and ff which represents one
       byte of the address, which is in network byte order (big-endian).   The
       IP-number may be a hostname which can be resolved by DNS or a dot sepa‐
       rated number.
