NAME

fns_references
&minus; overview of FNS References

DESCRIPTION

Every composite
name in FNS is bound to a reference. A
reference consists of a type and a list of addresses. The
reference type is used to identify the type of object.

An address is
something that can be used with some communication mechanism
to invoke operations on an object or service. Multiple
addresses are intended to identify multiple communication
endpoints for a single conceptual object or service. Each
address in a reference consists of an address type and an
opaque buffer. The address type determines the format and
interpretation of the address data. Together, the
address&rsquo;s type and data specify how to reach the
object. Many communication mechanisms are possible;
FNS does not place any restrictions on them.

The following
summarizes the reference and address types that are
currently defined. New types should be registered with the
Federated Naming Group at SunSoft.

Reference
Types 
All reference types use the FN_ID_STRING identifier
format unless otherwise qualified. 
onc_fn_enterprise

Enterprise root context.

onc_fn_organization

A context for naming objects
related to an organizational unit.

onc_fn_hostname

A context for naming hosts.

onc_fn_username

A context for naming users.

onc_fn_user

A context for naming objects
related to a user.

onc_fn_host

A context for naming objects
related to a computer.

onc_fn_site

A context for naming sites.

onc_fn_service

A context for naming
services.

onc_fn_nsid

A context for naming namespace
identifiers.

onc_fn_generic

A context for naming
application-specific objects.

onc_fn_fs

A context for naming files,
directories, and file systems.

onc_fn_printername

A context for naming
printers.

onc_printers

A printer object. When
implemented on top of NIS+, this could also be a
context for naming printers.

fn_link_ref

An XFN link.

inet_domain

An Internet domain.

Address
Types 
All address types use the FN_ID_STRING identifier
format unless otherwise qualified. The format of address
contents is determined by the corresponding address type.

onc_fn_nisplus

For an FNS
enterprise-level object implemented on top of NIS+. The
address contains the context type, context representation
type (either normal or merged), version number of the
reference, and the NIS+ name of the object. The only
intended use of this reference is that it be passed to
fn_ctx_handle_from_ref(3XFN)

onc_fn_nis

For an FNS enterprise-level
object implemented on top of NIS. The address contains the
context type and version number of the reference, and the
NIS name of the object. The only intended use of this
reference is that it be passed to
fn_ctx_handle_from_ref(3XFN).

onc_fn_files

For an FNS
enterprise-level object implemented on top of /etc
files. The address contains the context type and version
number of the reference, and the location of the object in
the /etc file system. The only intended use of this
reference is that it be passed to
fn_ctx_handle_from_ref(3XFN).

onc_fn_fs_user

For a user&rsquo;s home
directory. The address contains the user&rsquo;s name and
the name of the naming service password table where the
user&rsquo;s home directory is stored.

onc_fn_fs_user_nisplus

For a user&rsquo;s home
directory. The address contains the user&rsquo;s name and
the name of the NIS+ password table where the
user&rsquo;s home directory is stored.

onc_fn_fs_host

For all file systems exported
by a host. The address contains the host&rsquo;s name.

onc_fn_fs_mount

For a single mount point. The
address contains the mount options, the name of the servers
and the exported path. See mount(1M).

onc_fn_printer_files

For a printer&rsquo;s address
in the files naming service.

onc_fn_printer_nis

For a printer&rsquo;s address
in the NIS naming service.

onc_fn_printer_nisplus

For a printer&rsquo;s address
in the NIS+ naming service.

fn_link_addr

For an XFN link address.
The contents is the string form of the composite name.

inet_domain

For an Internet domain. The
address contains the fully-qualified domain name (for
example, "Wiz.COM.")

inet_ipaddr_string

For an object with an Internet
address. The address contains an internet IP address
in dotted string form (for example,
"192.144.2.3").

x500

For an X.500 object. The address contains an X.500
Distinguished Name, in the syntax specified in the X/Open
DCE: Directory Services.

osi_paddr

For an object with an
OSI presentation address. The address contains the
string encoding of an OSI Presentation Address as
defined in A string encoding of Presentation Address
(RFC 1278).

onc_printers_bsaddr

For a printer that understands
the BSD print protocol. The address contains the
machine name and printer name used by the protocol.

onc_printers_use

For a printer alias. The
address contains a printer name.

onc_printers_all

For a list of printers that are
enumerated using the "all" option. The address
contains a list of printer names.

onc_printers_location

For a printer&rsquo;s location.
The address format is unspecified.

onc_printers_type

For a printer&rsquo;s type. The
address format is unspecified.

onc_printers_speed

For a printer&rsquo;s speed.
The address format is unspecified.
