NAME

vmstat −
report virtual memory statistics

SYNOPSIS

vmstat
[-cipsS] [disks] [ interval
[count]]

DESCRIPTION

vmstat
reports virtual memory statistics regarding kernel thread,
virtual memory, disk, trap, and CPU activity.

On MP
(multi-processor) systems, vmstat averages the number
of CPUs into the output. For per-processor
statistics, see mpstat(1M).

vmstat
only supports statistics for certain devices. For more
general system statistics, use sar(1),
iostat(1M), or sar(1M).

Without
options, vmstat displays a one-line summary of the
virtual memory activity since the system was booted.

During
execution of this kernel status command, the
"state" of the kernel can change. An example would
be CPUs going online or offline. vmstat will
report this as >.

See System
Administration Guide: Advanced Administration for device
naming conventions for disks.

OPTIONS

The following
options are supported:

-c

Report cache flushing statistics. By default, report the
total number of each kind of cache flushed since boot time.
The types are: user, context, region, segment, page, and
partial-page. 

-i

Report the number of interrupts per device. count
and interval does not apply to the -i
option. 

-p

Report paging activity in details. This option will
display the following, respectively:

epi

Executable page-ins.

epo

Executable page-outs.

epf

Executable page-frees.

api

Anonymous page-ins.

apo

Anonymous page-outs.

apf

Anonymous page-frees.

fpi

File system page-ins.

fpo

File system page-outs.

fpf

File system page-frees.

-s

Display the
total number of various system events since boot.
count and interval does not apply to the
-s option.

-S

Report on swapping rather than
paging activity. This option will change two fields in
vmstat’s ’’paging’’
display: rather than the ’’re’’ and
’’mf’’ fields, vmstat will
report ’’si’’ (swap-ins) and
’’so’’ (swap-outs).

OPERANDS

The following
operands are supported:

count

Specifies the number of times
that the statitics are repeated. count does not apply
to the -i and -s options.

disks

Specifies which disks are to be given priority in the
output (only four disks fit on a line). Common disk names
are id, sd, xd, or xy, followed
by a number (for example, sd2, xd0, and so
forth). 

interval

Specifies the last number of
seconds over which vmstat summarizes activity. This
number of seconds repeats forever. interval does not
apply to the -i and -s options.

EXAMPLES

Example 1:
Using vmstat

The following
command displays a summary of what the system is doing every
five seconds.

The fields of
vmstat’s display are

kthr

Report the number of kernel threads in each of the three
following states:

r

in run queue

b

blocked for resources I/O, paging, and so
forth 

w

swapped

memory

Report on usage of virtual and
real memory.

swap

amount of swap space currently available (Kbytes)

free

size of the free list (Kbytes)

page

Report
information about page faults and paging activity. The
information on each of the following activities is given in
units per second.

re

page reclaims — but see
the -S option for how this field is modified.

mf

minor faults — but see the -S option for
how this field is modified.

pi

kilobytes paged in

po

kilobytes paged out

fr

kilobytes freed

de

anticipated short-term memory shortfall (Kbytes)

sr

pages scanned by clock algorithm

disk

Report the
number of disk operations per second. There are slots for up
to four disks, labeled with a single letter and number. The
letter indicates the type of disk (s = SCSI, i =
IPI, and so forth); the number is the logical unit
number.

faults

Report the trap/interrupt rates
(per second).

in

interrupts

sy

system calls

cs

CPU context switches

cpu

Give a
breakdown of percentage usage of CPU time. On
MP systems, this is an average across all
processors.

us

user time

sy

system time

id

idle time

NOTES

The sum of CPU
utilization might vary slightly from 100 because of rounding
errors in the production of a percentage figure.
