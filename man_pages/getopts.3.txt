GETOPTS(3) libbash getopts Library Manual GETOPTS(3)

NAME

getopts — libbash
library for command line parameters parsing

SYNOPSIS

$retval
getopt_long ⟨ Instructions⟩ ⟨
Parameters⟩

DESCRIPTION

This is a documentation for
libbash getopts library, that implements
getopt_long function for bash(1). For documentation
of bash getopts function, please see getopts(1) (
getopts(1posix) on some systems).

Here is a table
for reference:

getopts(1)

(or 1posix on
some systems) implemented by bash

getopts(3)

implemented by
libbash.

getopt(1)

implemented by
getopt utils (part of util-linux)

getopt_long(1)

implemented by
libbash and installed to section 1 instead of 3 to
prevent collision with C man pages.

getopt(3)

implemented by
GNU C library.

getopt_long(3)

implemented by
GNU C library.

I have also seen separate getopt
utility which part of util-linux package.

The
getopt_long function parses the command line
arguments. It uses Instructions as the rules for
parsing the Parameters.

The
Instructions 
A string that specifies rules for parameters parsing. The
instructions string is built of a group of independent
instructions, separated by a white space. Each instruction
must have the following structure:

-|--->[:]

This structure
contains three parts:

-

This is the parameter
single-letter sign. For example −h.

--

This is the parameter’s
corresponding multi-letter sign. For example
−-help.

[:]

This is the name of the
variable that will contain the parameter value. For example:
HELP.

The Variable
name can represent one of two variables types:

Flag variable (not
followed by ’:’)

In this case, it will hold the
value 1 if ’on’ (i.e. was specified on command
line) and will not be defined if ’off’.

Value variable (followed
by ’:’)

In this case, the value it will
hold is the string that was given as the next parameter in
the Parameters string (Separated by white-space or
’=’ ). If input contains more then one instance
of the considered command line option, an array of the given
parameters will be set as the value of the variable.

The
Parameters 
The Parameters are simply the parameters you wish to
parse.

RETURN VALUE

This function returns a string
that contains a set of variables definitions. In order to
define the variables, this string should be given as a
parameter to eval function. This value is returned in
the variable $retval.

EXAMPLES

Parse command line parameters
looking for the flags −h | −-help
and −v | −-version and for the
value −p | −-path :

getopt_long
’−h|−−help−>HELP 
−v|−−version−>VERSION 
−p|−−path−>PATH:’ $* 
eval $retval

In this example,
for the parameters --help --path=/usr/ the variables
that will be created are:

HELP=1 
PATH=/usr/

for the
parameters --help --path=/usr --path=/bin the
variables that will be created are:

HELP=1 
PATH=(/usr /bin)

BUGS

Values must not contain the
string ’__getopts__’. This string will be parsed
as a single white-space.

A value should
not start with an already defined multi-letter sign. If such
a value exists, it will be treated as the equivalent
singe-letter sign. This bug only accures when using a
single-letter sign, or a multi-letter sign that are not
followed by a ’=’.

For example: If
we have a script named ’foo’, and we parse the
parameters ’−d|−−dir:’ and
’−f|−−file:’, then

foo −d
−−file

and

foo
−−dir −−file

will not work

foo
−−dir=−−file

will work.
