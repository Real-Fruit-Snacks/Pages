NAME

nbdkit-torrent-plugin
- serve a BitTorrent file or magnet link over NBD

SYNOPSIS

nbdkit torrent
FILE.torrent|'magnet:?xt=urn:...' 
[file=DISK.iso] [cache=DIR] ...

DESCRIPTION

"nbdkit-torrent-plugin"
is an nbdkit(1) plugin which lets you serve a single
file from within a torrent read-only over NBD. The torrent
to download can be a local FILE.torrent file, or a
magnet link.

A single
torrent contains a collection of files, and by default this
plugin serves the largest file within the torrent. For
operating system installers this is usually the large ISO
file and ignores other small files like READMEs. You can
also select a particular file by name to serve.

If you want to
turn a file hosted on a web server into an NBD export use
nbdkit-curl-plugin(1) instead. If you have a local
ISO you can simply serve it using
nbdkit-file-plugin(1). If you want to turn a local
directory into an ISO use nbdkit-iso-plugin(1).

NOTES

This plugin
implements a full-featured BitTorrent client. BitTorrent
clients form a peer-to-peer (p2p) network and upload the
file to other clients as well as downloading.

By default the
plugin will cache the downloaded torrent into $TMPDIR,
potentially consuming a lot of disk space. See the
"cache=DIR" parameter for how to control this.

By default the
plugin will consume all available network bandwidth in both
download and upload directions. To limit it, set
"download-rate-limit" and
"upload-rate-limit" appropriately.

EXAMPLES

Boot the
Fedora installer 
Choose the right URL from
https://torrent.fedoraproject.org/:

url=https://torrent.fedoraproject.org/torrents/Fedora-Server-dvd-x86_64-32.torrent

wget $url 
nbdkit torrent Fedora-Server-*.torrent \ 
--run 'qemu-system-x86_64 -m 2048 -cdrom $nbd -boot d'

Boot the
Debian installer 
Choose the right URL from
https://www.debian.org/CD/torrent-cd/:

url=https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/amd64/bt-dvd/debian-10.4.0-amd64-DVD-1.iso.torrent

wget $url 
nbdkit torrent debian-*.torrent \ 
--run 'qemu-system-x86_64 -m 2048 -cdrom $nbd -boot d'

PARAMETERS

cache=DIR

Set a directory which will be
used to store the partially downloaded torrent between
runs.

This parameter
is optional. If not given then the plugin will create
a randomly named temporary directory under $TMPDIR, and will
attempt to ensure it is cleaned up on exit (thus unless you
set "cache", no state is saved between runs and
the whole torrent must be downloaded each time).

connections-limit=N

Set limit on number of
connections to other peers that this client will open
(default 200).

download-rate-limit=BITS_PER_SEC

Set the download rate limit in
bits per second. Usual abbreviations can be used such as
"download-rate-limit=1M" for 1 megabit per second.
0 means unlimited, which is the default.

file=DISK.iso

Select the file from within the
torrent to serve.

This parameter
is optional. If not specified then the plugin searches the
torrent for the largest file and serves that. This is
usually the right thing to do for operating system
installers and similar because it serves the large
.iso file and ignores other files like READMEs.

The parameter
is actually a path relative to the root directory of the
torrent, so if the torrent contains subdirectories you may
need to use a path like "file=SUBDIR/DISK". To
list all the files within the torrent try running:

$ nbdkit -fv
torrent file.torrent

and examining
the debug output. As an alternative you can use standard
BitTorrent tools, eg:

$
transmission-show file.torrent

listen-interfaces=IP_ADDRESS:PORT[,IP_ADDRESS:PORT[,...]]

Listening ports that are opened
for accepting incoming connections. The parameter is a
comma-separated list of "IP-address:port".

outgoing-interfaces=IP_ADDRESS[,IP_ADDRESS[,...]]

Controls which IP address
outgoing TCP connections are bound to. The parameter is a
comma-separated list of IP addresses.

[torrent=]FILE.torrent

Specify a local torrent
file.

[torrent=]magnet:?xt=urn:...

Specify a magnet link.

"torrent="
is a magic config key and may be omitted in most cases. See
"Magic parameters" in nbdkit(1).

upload-rate-limit=BITS_PER_SEC

Set the upload rate limit in
bits per second. Usual abbreviations can be used such as
"upload-rate-limit=1M" for 1 megabit per second. 0
means unlimited, which is the default.

user-agent=STRING

Set the user-agent. The
recommended format is
"client-name/client-version".

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

"TMPDIR"

This directory is used to cache
the downloaded torrent file (or /var/tmp if not set).
See also the "cache=DIR" parameter above.

FILES

$plugindir/nbdkit-torrent-plugin.so

The plugin.

Use
"nbdkit --dump-config" to find the location of
$plugindir.
