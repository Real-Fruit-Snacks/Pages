NAME
       gh-codespace-cp - Copy files between local and remote file systems

SYNOPSIS
       gh codespace cp [-e] [-r] [-- [<scp flags>...]] <sources>... <dest>

DESCRIPTION
       The cp command copies files between the local and remote file systems.

       As  with  the  UNIX cp command, the first argument specifies the source
       and the last specifies the destination; additional sources may be spec‐
       ified after the first, if the destination is a directory.

       The --recursive flag is required if any source is a directory.

       A  "remote:"  prefix on any file name argument indicates that it refers
       to the file system of the remote (Codespace) machine.  It  is  resolved
       relative to the home directory of the remote user.

       By default, remote file names are interpreted literally. With the --ex‐
       pand flag, each such argument is treated in the manner  of  scp,  as  a
       Bash  expression  to be evaluated on the remote machine, subject to ex‐
       pansion of tildes, braces, globs, environment variables, and backticks.
       For security, do not use this flag with arguments provided by untrusted
       users;  see   https://lwn.net/Articles/835962/   ⟨https://lwn.net/Arti‐
       cles/835962/⟩ for discussion.

       By  default, the 'cp' command will create a public/private ssh key pair
       to authenticate with the codespace inside the ~/.ssh directory.
