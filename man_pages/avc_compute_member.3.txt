NAME

avc_compute_create,
avc_compute_member - obtain SELinux label for new object

SYNOPSIS

#include

#include 

int
avc_compute_create(security_id_t ssid,
security_id_t tsid,

security_class_t
tclass, security_id_t
*newsid);

int
avc_compute_member(security_id_t ssid,
security_id_t tsid,

security_class_t
tclass, security_id_t
*newsid);

DESCRIPTION

avc_compute_create()
is used to compute a SID to use for labeling a new object in
a particular class based on a SID pair. This call is
identical to security_compute_create(), but does not
require converting from userspace SID&rsquo;s to contexts
and back again.

avc_compute_member()
is used to compute a SID to use for labeling a
polyinstantiated object instance of a particular class based
on a SID pair. This call is identical to
security_compute_member(), but does not require
converting from userspace SID&rsquo;s to contexts and back
again.

These functions
return a SID for the computed context in the memory
referenced by sid.

RETURN VALUE

On success,
zero is returned. On error, -1 is returned and errno
is set appropriately.

ERRORS

EINVAL

The tclass and/or the
security contexts referenced by ssid and tsid
are not recognized by the currently loaded policy.

ENOMEM

An attempt to allocate memory failed.
