NAME

pnmtile -
replicate an image to fill a specified region

SYNOPSIS

pnmtile
width height [pnmfile]

DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

pnmtile
reads a PNM image as input. It replicates it to fill an area
of the specified dimensions and produces an image in the
same format as output.

You can do
pretty much the reverse with pamdice.

You can
explicitly concatenate an image to itself (or anything else)
with pamcat.

If you’re
trying to tile multiple images into a superimage, see
pamundice or (for a thumbnail sheet)
pnmindex.

OPTIONS

There are no
command line options defined specifically for
pnmtile, but it recognizes the options common to all
programs based on libnetpbm (See
 Common Options
.)
