DESCRIPTION

Tools for
developers, maintainers, and forensic specialists.

This is a
collection of low-level tools to inspect and manipulate
OpenPGP data structures.

SUBCOMMANDS

sq toolbox
keyring 
Manage collections of keys or certs.

Collections of
keys or certificates (also known as "keyrings"
when they contain secret key material, and
"certrings" when they don&rsquo;t) are any number
of concatenated certificates. This subcommand provides tools
to list, split, merge, and filter keyrings.

Note: In the
documentation of this subcommand, we sometimes use the terms
keys and certs interchangeably.

sq toolbox
extract-cert 
Convert a key to a cert.

After
generating a key, use this command to get the certificate
corresponding to the key. The key must be kept secure, while
the certificate should be handed out to correspondents, e.g.
by uploading it to a key server.

sq toolbox
packet 
Low-level packet manipulation.

An OpenPGP data
stream consists of packets. These tools allow working with
packet streams. They are mostly of interest to developers,
but &rsquo;sq toolbox packet dump&rsquo; may be helpful to a
wider audience both to provide valuable information in bug
reports to OpenPGP-related software, and as a learning
tool.

sq toolbox
armor 
Convert binary to ASCII.

To make
encrypted data easier to handle and transport, OpenPGP data
can be transformed to an ASCII representation called ASCII
Armor. sq emits armored data by default, but this subcommand
can be used to convert existing OpenPGP data to its
ASCII-encoded representation.

The converse
operation is &rsquo;sq toolbox dearmor&rsquo;.

sq toolbox
dearmor 
Convert ASCII to binary.

To make
encrypted data easier to handle and transport, OpenPGP data
can be transformed to an ASCII representation called ASCII
Armor. sq transparently handles armored data, but this
subcommand can be used to explicitly convert existing
ASCII-encoded OpenPGP data to its binary representation.

The converse
operation is &rsquo;sq toolbox armor&rsquo;.

EXAMPLES

sq toolbox
extract-cert 
First, generate a key

sq key generate
--userid &rsquo;juliet [AT] example.org>&rsquo; \

--output juliet.key.pgp

Then, extract
the certificate for distribution

sq toolbox
extract-cert --output juliet.cert.pgp juliet.key.pgp

sq toolbox
armor 
Convert a binary certificate to ASCII

sq toolbox
armor binary-juliet.pgp

Convert a
binary message to ASCII

sq toolbox
armor binary-message.pgp

sq toolbox
dearmor 
Convert a ASCII certificate to binary

sq toolbox
dearmor ascii-juliet.pgp

Convert a ASCII
message to binary

sq toolbox
dearmor ascii-message.pgp
