NAME

arp âˆ’
address resolution display and control

SYNOPSIS

arp
hostname

arp
-a [-n]

arp
-d hostname

arp
-f filename

arp
-s hostname ether_address [temp] [pub]
[trail]

DESCRIPTION

The arp
program displays and modifies the Internet-to-Ethernet
address translation tables used by the address resolution
protocol (see arp(7P)).

With no flags,
the program displays the current ARP entry for
hostname. The host may be specified by name or by
number, using Internet dot notation.

OPTIONS

-a

Display all of the current
ARP entries. The definition for the flags in the
table are:

P

Publish;
includes IP address for the machine and the addresses that
have explicitly been added by the -s option. ARP will
respond to ARP requests for this address.

S

Static; not learned for the ARP
protocol. 

U

Unresolved; waiting for ARP response.

M

Mapping; only used for the multicast entry for
224.0.0.0 

You can use the -n option
with the -a option to disable the automatic numeric
IP address-to-name translation. Use arp -an or
arp -na to display numeric IP addresses.

-d

Delete an entry for the host
called hostname. This option may only be used by the
super-user. 

-f

Read the file named filename and set multiple
entries in the ARP tables. Entries in the file should
be of the form

hostname
ether_address [ temp ] [ pub ] [
trail ]

(see option
-s for argument definitions).

-s

Create an ARP entry for
the host called hostname with the Ethernet address
ether_address. The Ethernet address is given as six
hexadecimal bytes separated by colons. The entry will be
permanent unless the word temp is given in the
command. If the word pub is given, the entry will be
published. For instance, this system will respond to
ARP requests for hostname even though the
hostname is not its own. The word trail indicates
that trailer encapsulations may be sent to this host.
arp -s can be used for a limited form of proxy
ARP when a host on one of the directly attached
networks is not physically present on the subnet. Another
machine can then be configured to respond to ARP
requests using arp -s. This is useful in certain
SLIP or PPP configurations.
