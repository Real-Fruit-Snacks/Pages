NAME
       ppmmake - create a PPM image of a specified color and dimensions

SYNOPSIS
       ppmmake [-maxval=maxval] color width height

       All  options  can  be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.  You
       may use two hyphens instead of one to designate an option.  You may use
       either  white  space  or  an equals sign between an option name and its
       value.

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       ppmmake produces a PPM image of the specified color, width, height, and
       maxval.

       Specify  the  color  (color)  as  described  for  the  argument  of the
       pnm_parsecolor() library routine ⟨libnetpbm_image.html#colorname⟩ .

EXAMPLES
           ppmmake red 50 50

           ppmmake rgb:ff/80/80 50 100 -maxval=5

OPTIONS
       In addition to the options common to all programs  based  on  libnetpbm
       (most notably -quiet, see
        Common  Options  ⟨index.html#commonoptions⟩  ), ppmmake recognizes the
       following command line option:

       -maxval=maxval
                   The maxval for the generated image.  Default is 255.

                   This option did not exist before June  2002.   Before,  the
              maxval was
                   always 255.
