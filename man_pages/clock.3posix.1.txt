CLOCK(3POSIX)              POSIX Programmer's Manual             CLOCK(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       clock — report CPU time used

SYNOPSIS
       #include <time.h>

       clock_t clock(void);

DESCRIPTION
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with  the
       ISO C  standard.  Any  conflict between the requirements described here
       and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017
       defers to the ISO C standard.

       The  clock() function shall return the implementation's best approxima‐
       tion to the processor time used by the process since the  beginning  of
       an implementation-defined era related only to the process invocation.

RETURN VALUE
       To  determine the time in seconds, the value returned by clock() should
       be divided by the value of the macro CLOCKS_PER_SEC.  CLOCKS_PER_SEC is
       defined  to  be one million in <time.h>.  If the processor time used is
       not available or its value cannot be represented,  the  function  shall
       return the value (clock_t)-1.

ERRORS
       No errors are defined.

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       In  programming environments where clock_t is a 32-bit integer type and
       CLOCKS_PER_SEC is one million, clock() will start failing in less  than
       36  minutes of processor time for signed clock_t, or 72 minutes for un‐
       signed clock_t.  Applications intended to be portable to such  environ‐
       ments   should   use   times()   instead   (or   clock_gettime()   with
       CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID, if supported).

       In order to measure the time spent in  a  program,  clock()  should  be
       called at the start of the program and its return value subtracted from
       the value returned by subsequent calls. The value returned  by  clock()
       is  defined for compatibility across systems that have clocks with dif‐
       ferent resolutions. The resolution on any particular system need not be
       to microsecond accuracy.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
