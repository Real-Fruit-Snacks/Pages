NAME
       pnmtosgi - convert a PNM image to a SGI image file

SYNOPSIS
       pnmtosgi

       [-verbatim|-rle]

       [-imagename Name]

       [pnmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       pnmtosgi  reads  a PNM image as input and produces an SGI image file as
       output.  The SGI image will be 2-dimensional (1 channel)  for  PBM  and
       PGM input, and 3-dimensional (3 channels) for PPM.

OPTIONS
       In  addition  to  the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm
       (most notably -quiet, see
        Common Options ⟨index.html#commonoptions⟩ ), pnmtosgi  recognizes  the
       following command line options:

       -verbatim
              Write an uncompressed file.

       -rle (default)
              Write a compressed (run length encoded) file.

       -imagename name
              Write  the string "name" into the imagename field of the header.
              The name string is limited to 79  characters.   If  no  name  is
              given, pnmtosgi writes "no name" into this field.
