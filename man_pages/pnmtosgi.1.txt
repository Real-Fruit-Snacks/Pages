output. The SGI image will be 2-dimensional (1 channel) for
PBM and PGM input, and 3-dimensional (3 channels) for
PPM.

In addition to
the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most
notably -quiet, see
 Common Options ),
pnmtosgi recognizes the following command line
options: 
-verbatim

Write an uncompressed file.

-rle (default)

Write a compressed (run length
encoded) file.

-imagename
name

Write the string
"name" into the imagename field of the header. The
name string is limited to 79 characters. If no name is
given, pnmtosgi writes "no name" into this
field.
