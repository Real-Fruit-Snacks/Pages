NAME
       Font::TTF::Anchor - Anchor points for GPOS tables

DESCRIPTION
       The Anchor defines an anchor point on a glyph providing various
       information depending on how much is available, including such
       information as the co-ordinates, a curve point and even device specific
       modifiers.

INSTANCE VARIABLES
       x   XCoordinate of the anchor point

       y   YCoordinate of the anchor point

       p   Curve point on the glyph to use as the anchor point

       xdev
           Device table (delta) for the xcoordinate

       ydev
           Device table (delta) for the ycoordinate

       xid XIdAnchor for multiple master horizontal metric id

       yid YIdAnchor for multiple master vertical metric id

METHODS
   new
       Creates a new Anchor

   read($fh)
       Reads the anchor from the given file handle at that point. The file
       handle is left at an arbitrary read point, usually the end of
       something!

   out($fh, $style)
       Outputs the Anchor to the given file handle at this point also
       addressing issues of deltas. If $style is set, then no output is sent
       to the file handle. The return value is the output string.

   $a->out_xml($context)
       Outputs the anchor in XML
