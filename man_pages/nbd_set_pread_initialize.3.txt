NAME

nbd_set_pread_initialize
- control whether libnbd pre-initializes read buffers

SYNOPSIS

#include

int nbd_set_pread_initialize ( 
struct nbd_handle *h, bool request 
);

DESCRIPTION

By default,
libnbd will pre-initialize the contents of a buffer passed
to calls such as nbd_pread(3) to all zeroes prior to
checking for any other errors, so that even if a client
application passed in an uninitialized buffer but fails to
check for errors, it will not result in a potential security
risk caused by an accidental leak of prior heap contents
(see CVE-2022-0485 in libnbd-security(3) for an
example of a security hole in an application built against
an earlier version of libnbd that lacked consistent
pre-initialization). However, for a client application that
has audited that an uninitialized buffer is never
dereferenced, or which performs its own pre-initialization,
libnbd&rsquo;s sanitization efforts merely pessimize
performance (although the time spent in pre-initialization
may pale in comparison to time spent waiting on network
packets).

Calling this
function with "request" set to false tells libnbd
to skip the buffer initialization step in read commands.

RETURN VALUE

If the call is
successful the function returns 0.

ERRORS

On error -1 is
returned.

Refer to
"ERROR HANDLING" in libnbd(3) for how to
get further details of the error.

The following
parameters must not be NULL: "h". For more
information see "Non-NULL parameters" in
libnbd(3).

VERSION

This function
first appeared in libnbd 1.12.

If you need to
test if this function is available at compile time check if
the following macro is defined:

#define
LIBNBD_HAVE_NBD_SET_PREAD_INITIALIZE 1
