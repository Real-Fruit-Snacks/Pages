NAME

wineserver
&minus; the Wine server

SYNOPSIS

wineserver [options]

DESCRIPTION

wineserver
is a daemon process that provides to Wine roughly the same
services that the Windows kernel provides on Windows.

wineserver
is normally launched automatically when starting
wine(1), so you shouldn&rsquo;t have to worry about
it. In some cases however, it can be useful to start
wineserver explicitly with different options, as
explained below.

OPTIONS

&minus;d[n]

Set the debug level to n.
0 means no debugging information, 1 is the normal level, and
2 is for extra verbose debugging. If n is not
specified, the default is 1. The debug output will be sent
to stderr. wine(1) will automatically set the debug
level when starting wineserver if the +server option
is set in the WINEDEBUG variable.

&minus;f

Make the server remain in the foreground for easier
debugging, for instance when running it under a
debugger. 

&minus;h

Display a help message.

&minus;k[n]

Kill the currently running wineserver, optionally
by sending signal n. If no signal is specified, sends
a SIGINT first and then a SIGKILL. The instance of
wineserver that is killed is selected based on the
WINEPREFIX environment variable.

&minus;p[n]

Specify the wineserver persistence delay, i.e.
the amount of time that the server will keep running when
all client processes have terminated. This avoids the cost
of shutting down and starting again when programs are
launched in quick succession. The timeout n is in
seconds, the default value is 3 seconds. If n is not
specified, the server stays around forever.

&minus;v

Display version information and exit.

&minus;w

Wait until the currently running wineserver
terminates. 

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

WINEPREFIX

If set, the content of this
variable is taken as the name of the directory where
wineserver stores its data (the default is
$HOME/.wine). All wine processes using the
same wineserver (i.e.: same user) share certain
things like registry, shared memory and kernel objects. By
setting WINEPREFIX to different values for different
Wine processes, it is possible to run a number of truly
independent Wine sessions.

WINESERVER

Specifies the path and name of
the wineserver binary that will be launched
automatically by wine. If not set, wine will
try to load /usr/bin/wineserver, and if this
doesn&rsquo;t exist it will then look for a file named
wineserver in the path and in a few other likely
locations.

FILES

~/.wine

Directory containing user
specific data managed by wine.

/tmp/.wine-uid

The directory containing the
server Unix socket and the lock file. These files are
created in a subdirectory generated from the WINEPREFIX
directory device and inode numbers.
