New APIs

nbd_set_opt_mode(3) 
nbd_get_opt_mode(3) 
nbd_aio_is_negotiating(3)

libnbd 1.4 adds a new
“negotiating” state during NBD handshaking. For
backwards compatibility programs must request this before
starting the connection by calling
nbd_set_opt_mode(3). You can find out if the
connection is in this state by calling
nbd_aio_is_negotiating(3).

For an in-depth
description of how this extra state can be used to negotiate
server options, see "CONTROLLING NEGOTIATION" in
libnbd(3).

nbd_aio_opt_abort(3)

nbd_opt_abort(3)

During the negotiating state,
abort the connection.

nbd_aio_opt_go(3)

nbd_opt_go(3)

During the negotiating state,
complete the handshake.

nbd_aio_opt_info(3)

nbd_opt_info(3)

During the negotiating state,
request full information about the server export.

nbd_aio_opt_list(3)

nbd_opt_list(3)

During the negotiating state,
request the list of exports that the server provides.

nbd_get_block_size(3)

Return the minimum, preferred
or maximum block size constraints for requests sent to the
server.

nbd_get_canonical_export_name(3)

Return the canonical export
name that the server defaults to. This information may only
be available if you call nbd_set_full_info(3) before
connecting.

nbd_get_export_description(3)

Return the optional text
description of the current export. This information may only
be available if you call nbd_set_full_info(3) before
connecting.

nbd_set_full_info(3)

nbd_get_full_info(3)

Enable extended information
about exports from the server.

Thanks: Eric
Blake for all of the new APIs.

New
features 
Bindings are now available in the Go programming
language.

FreeBSD and
OpenBSD are now fully supported platforms.

Bash tab
completion is available for all of the command line
tools.

Documentation

Verbatim text in man pages that wrapped over several lines
is now typeset correctly.

Links within
the documentation have been enhanced, and are now checked
for correctness.

Tools

New nbdcopy(1) tool lets you copy between an NBD
server and a local file, or stream to and from an NBD
server.

New
nbdinfo(1) tool lets you print extended information
about an NBD server’s exports (Eric Blake).

Tests

Test sockets are created in /tmp (instead of the
local directory). This stops the test suite from failing if
the local directory path is longer than the Unix domain
socket maximum path length.

Other
improvements and bug fixes 
Trace messages have been improved: long strings are
truncated, strings with non-printable characters are
escaped, and lists of strings are printed.

The generator
was split from a large single script into several small
files. To build from git the OCaml bytecode compiler
(ocamlc(1)) is now required instead of the
interpreter (ocaml(1)).

Long login
names are supported in nbd_get_tls_username(3).

The handle name
in nbdsh(1) is now set to "nbdsh" (instead
of a randomly generated name).

Compatibility
with OCaml 4.10.0 and 4.11.0.

Python AIO
buffer adds a new "is_zero" method allowing Python
clients to do sparsification when copying.

Compatibility
with Python 3.9.

External C
programs can now be compiled against libnbd’s build
directory using "../libnbd/run ./configure".

Honggfuzz can
be used as another external fuzzing option.

Fix compilation
with glibc 2.32 which deprecates
"sys_errlist".

Many examples
added or extended to demonstrate uses of the new APIs (Eric
Blake).
