VFPRINTF(3POSIX)           POSIX Programmer's Manual          VFPRINTF(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       vdprintf, vfprintf, vprintf, vsnprintf, vsprintf — format output  of  a
       stdarg argument list

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdarg.h>
       #include <stdio.h>

       int vdprintf(int fildes, const char *restrict format, va_list ap);
       int vfprintf(FILE *restrict stream, const char *restrict format,
           va_list ap);
       int vprintf(const char *restrict format, va_list ap);
       int vsnprintf(char *restrict s, size_t n, const char *restrict format,
           va_list ap);
       int vsprintf(char *restrict s, const char *restrict format, va_list ap);

DESCRIPTION
       The  functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
       ISO C standard. Any conflict between the  requirements  described  here
       and  the  ISO C  standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1‐2017
       defers to the ISO C standard.

       The vdprintf(),  vfprintf(),  vprintf(),  vsnprintf(),  and  vsprintf()
       functions  shall  be equivalent to the  dprintf(), fprintf(), printf(),
       snprintf(), and sprintf() functions respectively, except  that  instead
       of  being  called  with a variable number of arguments, they are called
       with an argument list as defined by <stdarg.h>.

       These functions shall not invoke the va_end macro. As  these  functions
       invoke  the  va_arg macro, the value of ap after the return is unspeci‐
       fied.

RETURN VALUE
       Refer to fprintf().

ERRORS
       Refer to fprintf().

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       Applications using these functions should call va_end(ap) afterwards to
       clean up.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
