NAME

ethers &minus;
Ethernet address to hostname database or domain

DESCRIPTION

The
ethers file is a local source of information about
the (48 bit) Ethernet addresses of hosts on the Internet.
The ethers file can be used in conjunction with or
instead of other ethers sources, including the NIS
maps ethers.byname and ethers.byaddr and the
NIS+ table ethers. Programs use the
ethers(3SOCKET) routines to access this
information.

The
ethers file has one line for each host on an
Ethernet. The line has the following format:

Ethernet-address
official-host-name

Items are
separated by any number of SPACE and/or TAB
characters. A &rsquo;#&rsquo; indicates the beginning
of a comment extending to the end of line.

The standard
form for Ethernet addresses is
"x:x:x:x:x:x"
where x is a hexadecimal number between 0 and ff,
representing one byte. The address bytes are always in
network order. Host names may contain any printable
character other than SPACE, TAB,
NEWLINE, or comment character.
