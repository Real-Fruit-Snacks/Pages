NAME

t1mapper
&minus; A tool to help xdvi use all your t1 fonts

SYNOPSIS

t1mapper
[OPTIONS] TeX-fontdir Type1-font-file-spec

t1mapper
[OPTIONS] -gs GS-fontmap GS-fontdir
TeX-fontdir

DESCRIPTION

The
t1mapper comes with xdvik. It was made to make
it simple to make all sorts of Postscript Type1
(T1) fonts available to xdvi. The first invocation is
to make any T1 font you may have floating around on your
system available to xdvi. The second invocation is
for hi-jacking fonts from your Ghostscript installation,
which will supply xdvi with all the standard T1 fonts
it needs.

t1mapper
relies on a installed and working texk system to be
present. In particular it uses kpsewhich to locate
the fontname package .map files which maps between
Postscript font names and TeX font names.
teTeX is one such texk system.

When invoked
without the -gs option, t1mapper will examine each of
the fonts specified. It will attempt to determine the
Postscript name of the font by looking inside the font file,
and if that name has a TeX equivalent it will copy, link or
symlink your the file into the TeX font directory you named
first on the command line. The name in the TeX font
directory will be according to the TeX/KB-fontname scheme,
so that the font names used in .dvi files matches the
names found in the TeX font directories.

When invoked
with the -gs option t1mapper will read the
named GS Fontmap file to determine which GS font files
correspond to which standard Postscript fonts (GS&rsquo;
version of Times-Roman is not called Times-Roman,
it&rsquo;s actually called NimbusRomNo9L-Regu), and
then proceed to copy or link the files in the named GS font
directory into the named TeX font directory.

The
program&rsquo;s diagnostic output is also written to a
logfile t1map.log, which is created either in the
current working directory or in /tmp.

OPTIONS

All options
except -gs have to do with how the font files are
copied or linked into the TeX font directories:

-cp

Copy the files from the GS-fontdir or matching
the Type1-font-file-spec into the TeX-fontdir.
This is the default and will always work.

-ln

Hard link the files. This requires the fonts to reside
on the same disk, but it will save space, and the files will
not disappear from the TeX-fontdir if they are
removed from the source directory.

-lns

Symlink the files. This saves space, but if the original
files are removed the symlinks will be broken.

-lnlns

Attempt hard-link first, if it fails make symlink.

-lncp

Attempt hard-link first, if that fails, copy the
font. 

EXAMPLES

If your
Ghostscript is installed in
/usr/local/share/ghostscript and your TeX lives in
/usr/local/teTeX then this command will make your GS
fonts available to xdvi:

t1mapper -lns
-gs \ /usr/local/share/ghostscript/5.50/Fontmap \
/usr/local/share/ghostscript/fonts \
/usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf/fonts/type1/gs

The first
argument here is the full path to the GS Fontmap. The second
is the GS font directory, note the lack of wildcards here
(as opposed to the next example). The third argument is the
TeX font directory. If it does not exist it will be created.
Texk and teTeX uses quite finely structured font
directories, and the above reflects this.

If you have a
Solaris machine with Display Postscript fonts then this
command will make them available to xdvi:

t1mapper -lns \
/usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf/fonts/type1/gs \
/usr/openwin/lib/X11/fonts/Type1/*.pfa

Here the first
argument is the TeX font directory and thereafter comes a
wildcard that specifies which fonts to examine for
copying/linking into the TeX font directory.

FILES

fontname
Postscript to TeX name mapping files from
http://tug.org/fontname/, these are included in
teTeX.

Ghostscript
fonts from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/ghostscript/ or
http://www.gnu.org/software/ghostscript/ghostscript.html
