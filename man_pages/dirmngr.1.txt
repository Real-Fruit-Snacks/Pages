NAME

dirmngr &minus;
manages certificate revocation lists

SYNOPSIS

dirmngr
[options] [command [args]]

DESCRIPTION

dirmngr
is a server for managing and downloading certificate
revocation lists (CRLs) for X.509 certificates and for
downloading the certificates themselves. dirmngr also
handles OCSP requests as an alternative to CRLs.
dirmngr is either invoked internally by gpgsm
(from GnuPG 1.9) or when running as a system daemon through
the dirmngr-client tool.

OPTIONS

Commands are
not distinguished from options except for the fact that only
one one command is allowed.

Commands

&minus;&minus;version

Print the program version and
licensing information. Note that you can abbreviate this
command.

&minus;&minus;help,
&minus;h

Print a usage message
summarizing the most useful command-line options. Note that
you can abbreviate this command.

&minus;&minus;server

Run in server mode and wait for
commands on the stdin. The default mode is to create
a socket and listen for commands there.

&minus;&minus;daemon

Run in background daemon mode
and listen for commands on a socket. Note that this also
changes the default home directory and enables the internal
certificate validation code.

&minus;&minus;list&minus;crls

List the contents of the CRL
cache on stdout. This is probably only useful for
debugging purposes.

&minus;&minus;load&minus;crl
file

This command requires a file
name as additional argument, and it will make dirmngr
try to import the CRL in file into its cache. Note
that this is only possible if dirmngr is able to
retrieve the CA&rsquo;s certificate directly by its own
means. In general it is better to use gpgsm&rsquo;s
--call-dirmngr loadcrl filename command so that
gpgsm can help dirmngr.

&minus;&minus;fetch&minus;crl
url

This command requires an URL as
additional argument, and it will make dirmngr try to
retrieve an import the CRL from that URL into its cache.
This is mainly useful for debugging purposes.

&minus;&minus;shutdown

This commands shuts down a
running instance of dirmngr. This command has
currently no effect.

&minus;&minus;flush

This command removes all CRLs
from dirmngr&rsquo;s cache. Client requests will thus
trigger reading of fresh CRLs.

Options 
&minus;&minus;options file

Reads configuration from
file instead of from the default per-user
configuration file. The default configuration file is named
gpgsm.conf and expected in the home directory.

&minus;&minus;homedir
dir

Set the name of the home
directory to dir. This option is only effective when
used on the command line. The default depends on the running
mode: 
With &minus;&minus;daemon given on the
commandline

the directory named
/etc/dirmngr for configuration files,
/var/lib/dirmngr/ for extra data and
/var/cache/dirmngr for cached CRLs.

Without
&minus;&minus;daemon given on the commandline

the directory named
.gnupg directly below the home directory of the user
unless the environment variable GNUPGHOME has been
set in which case its value will be used. All kind of data
is stored below this directory.

&minus;v,
&minus;&minus;verbose

Outputs additional information
while running. You can increase the verbosity by giving
several verbose commands to dirmngr, such as
-vv.

&minus;&minus;log&minus;file
file

Append all logging output to
file. This is very helpful in seeing what the agent
actually does.

&minus;&minus;debug&minus;level
level

Select the debug level for
investigating problems. level may be one of:

none

no debugging at all

basic

some basic debug messages

advanced

more verbose debug messages

expert

even more detailed messages

guru

all of the debug messages you can get

How these
messages are mapped to the actual debugging flags is not
specified and may change with newer releases of this
program. They are however carefully selected to best aid in
debugging.

&minus;&minus;debug
flags

This option is only useful for
debugging and the behaviour may change at any time without
notice. flags are bit encoded and may be given in
usual C syntax.

&minus;&minus;debug&minus;all

Same as
--debug=0xffffffff

&minus;&minus;debug&minus;wait
N

When running in server mode,
wait N seconds before entering the actual processing
loop and print the pid. This gives time to attach a
debugger.

&minus;s,
&minus;&minus;sh, &minus;c,
&minus;&minus;csh

Format the info output in
daemon mode for use with the standard Bourne shell
respectively the C shell . The default ist to guess it based
on the environment variable SHELL which is in almost
all cases sufficient.

&minus;&minus;force

Enabling this option forces
loading of expired CRLs; this is only useful for
debugging.

&minus;&minus;disable&minus;ldap

Entirely disables the use of
LDAP.

&minus;&minus;disable&minus;http

Entirely disables the use of
HTTP.

&minus;&minus;ignore&minus;http&minus;dp

When looking for the location
of a CRL, the to be tested certificate usually contains so
called "CRL Distribution Point" (DP) entries which
are URLs describing the way to access the URL. The first
found DP entry is used. With this option all entries using
the HTTP scheme are ignored when looking for a suitable
DP.

&minus;&minus;ignore&minus;ldap&minus;dp

This is similar to
&minus;&minus;ignore&minus;http&minus;dp but ignores
entries using the LDAP scheme. Both options may be combined
resulting in ignoring DPs entirely.

&minus;&minus;honor&minus;http&minus;proxy

If the environment variable
http_proxy has been set, use its value to access HTTP
servers.

&minus;&minus;http&minus;proxy
host[:port]

Use host and port
to access HTTP servers. The use of this options overrides
the environment variable http_proxy regardless
whether &minus;&minus;honor&minus;http&minus;proxy
has been set.

&minus;&minus;ldap&minus;proxy
host[:port]

Use host and port
to connect to LDAP servers. If port is ommitted, port
389 (standard LDAP port) is used. This overrides any
specified host and port part in a LDAP URL and will also be
used if host and port have been ommitted from the URL.

&minus;&minus;only&minus;ldap&minus;proxy

Never use anything else but the
LDAP "proxy" as configured with
&minus;&minus;ldap&minus;proxy. Usually
dirmngr tries to use other configured LDAP server if
the connection using the "proxy" failed.

&minus;&minus;ldapserverlist&minus;file
file

Read the list of LDAP servers
to consult for CRLs and certificates from file
instead of the default per-user ldap server list file. The
default value for file is
dirmngr_ldapservers.conf or ldapservers.conf
when running in &minus;&minus;daemon mode.

This server list file contains one LDAP server per line
in the format

HOSTNAME:PORT:USERNAME:PASSWORD:BASE_DN 

Lines starting with a # are comments.

&minus;&minus;ldaptimeout
secs

Specify the number of seconds
to wait for an LDAP query before timing out. The default is
currently 100 seconds. 0 will never timeout.

&minus;&minus;add&minus;servers

This options makes
dirmngr add any servers it discovers when validating
certificates against CRLs to the internal list of servers to
consult for certificates and CRLs.

This options is useful when trying to validate a
certificate that has a CRL distribution point that points to
a server that is not already listed in the ldapserverlist.
dirmngr will always go to this server and try to
download the CRL, but chances are high that the certificate
used to sign the CRL is located on the same server. So if
dirmngr doesn&rsquo;t add that new server to list, it
will often not be able to verify the signature of the CRL
unless the &minus;&minus;add&minus;servers option
is used.

Note: The current version of dirmngr has this
option disabled by default.

&minus;&minus;allow&minus;ocsp

This option enables OCSP
support if requested by the client.

OCSP requests are rejected by default because they may
violate the privacy of the user; for example it is possible
to track the time when a user is reading a mail.

&minus;&minus;ocsp&minus;responder
url

Use url as the default
OCSP Responder if the certificate does not contain
information about an assigned responder. Note, that
&minus;&minus;ocsp&minus;signer must also be set to a
valid certificate.

&minus;&minus;ocsp&minus;signer
fpr

Use the certificate with the
fingerprint fpr to check the responses of the default
OCSP Responder. dirmngr will retrieve this
certificate from the current client.

&minus;&minus;max&minus;replies
N

Do not return more that
N items in one query. The default is 10.
