NVD(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual NVD(4)

NAME

nvd &mdash; NVM Express
disk driver

SYNOPSIS

To compile this driver into your
kernel, place the following lines in your kernel
configuration file:

device nvme

device nvd

Or, to load the
driver as a module at boot, place the following lines in
loader.conf(5):

nvme_load="YES"

nvd_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION

The nvd driver exposes
NVM Express (NVMe) namespaces as disks to the kernel disk
storage API. It depends on the nvme(4) driver for
notification of existing NVMe namespaces and submission of
NVM I/O commands.

Device nodes
from the nvd driver will have the format /dev/nvdX
and are GEOM(4) disks which can be partitioned by geom(8).
Note that device nodes from the nvme(4) driver are not
GEOM(4) disks and cannot be partitioned.

CONFIGURATION

The nvd driver defines a
system-wide maximum delete size for NVMe devices. The
default is 1GB. To select a different value, set the
following tunable in loader.conf(5):

hw.nvd.delete_max=

SEE ALSO

HISTORY

The nvd driver first
appeared in FreeBSD 9.2.
