[+folder] [msgs] [-component

[-append] [-list] [-delete]
[-number [num|all]] [-preserve |
-nopreserve] [-text body]

DESCRIPTION

anno
manipulates header fields or annotations in messages.
Header fields consist of a field name and an optional field
body as defined by RFC 2822. The -component switch
specifies the field name, and the -text switch
specifies the field body.

The messages
are either the msgs in the named folder, or the draft
if invoked with the -draft switch.

Usually,
annotation is performed by the commands dist,
forw, and repl, if they are given the
-anno switch. This allows you to keep track of your
distribution of, forwarding of, and replies to a
message.

By using
anno, you can perform arbitrary annotations of your
own. Each message selected will be annotated with the
lines

field: date

field: body

The
-nodate switch inhibits the date annotation, leaving
only the body annotation.

By default,
anno prepends the annotations to the message.
Annotations are instead appended if the -append
switch is specified.

If a
-component field is not specified when
anno is invoked, anno will prompt the user for
a field name.

The field
specified must be a valid RFC 2822-style message field name,
consisting only of alphanumeric characters and dashes. The
body may consist of arbitrary text.

Normally
anno does the annotation in place in order to
preserve any links to the message. You may change this by
using the -noinplace switch.

The
-list switch produces a listing of the field bodies
for header fields with names matching the specified
component, one per line. The listing is numbered, starting
at 1, if the -number switch is also used. A tab
character separates the number and the field body. The field
body is treated as if it is a file name, and only the final
path name component is listed. The complete field body is
listed if the -text switch is used; the argument to
the -text switch is required but ignored.

The
-delete switch removes header fields from messages.
The first header field whose name matches the component is
deleted if no other options are specified. If the
-text switch is used in conjunction with the
-delete switch, the first header field whose name
matches the component and whose body matches the text is
deleted. The text is treated as if it was a file name; if it
begins with a slash, the entire field body must match the
text, otherwise just the last path name component of the
field body must match. If the -number switch is used
in conjunction with the -delete switch, header field
num whose name matches the component is deleted. The
number matches that which is produced by the -list
switch. The special value all can be used for the
number, and causes all components that match the name to be
deleted.

By default,
anno changes the last-accessed and last-modified
times on annotated messages to the time of the annotation.
anno preserves the original times if the
-preserve switch is used. A matching
-nopreserve switch allows time preservation to be
turned off, if enabled in the profile.

become the current folder. The first message annotated will
become the current message.
