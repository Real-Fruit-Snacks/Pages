NAME

sq verify -
Verify signed messages or detached signatures

SYNOPSIS

sq
verify [OPTIONS] FILE

DESCRIPTION

Verify signed
messages or detached signatures.

When verifying
signed messages, the message is written to stdout or the
file given to &rsquo;--output&rsquo;.

When a detached
message is verified, no output is produced. Detached
signatures are often used to sign software packages.

Verification is
only successful if there is no bad signature, and the number
of successfully verified signatures reaches the threshold
configured with the &rsquo;--signatures&rsquo; parameter. If
the verification fails, the program terminates with an exit
status indicating failure. In addition to that, the last 25
MiB of the message are withheld, i.e. if the message is
smaller than 25 MiB, no output is produced, and if it is
larger, then the output will be truncated.

A signature is
considered to have been authenticated if the signer can be
authenticated. If the signer is provided via
&rsquo;--signer-file&rsquo;, then the signer is considered
authenticated. Otherwise, the signer is looked up and
authenticated using the Web of Trust. If at least one User
ID can be fully authenticated, then the signature is
considered to have been authenticated. If the signature
includes a Signer User ID subpacket, then only that User ID
is considered. Note: the User ID need not be self
signed.

The converse
operation is &rsquo;sq sign&rsquo;.

If you are
looking for a standalone program to verify detached
signatures, consider using sequoia-sqv.

&rsquo;sq
verify&rsquo; respects the reference time set by the
top-level &rsquo;--time&rsquo; argument. When set, it
verifies the message as of the reference time instead of the
current time.

OPTIONS

Subcommand
options 
--detached=SIG

Verify a detached signature

-n,
--signatures=N

Set the threshold of valid
signatures to N. If this threshold is not reached, the
message will not be considered verified.

-o,
--output=FILE

Write to FILE or stdout if
omitted

--signer-cert=FINGERPRINT|KEYID

Verify signatures using the
specified certificate. This reads the certificate from the
certificate store, and considers it to be authenticated.
When this option is not provided, the certificate is still
read from the certificate store, if it exists, but it is not
considered authenticated.

--signer-file=CERT_FILE

Verify signatures using the
certificate in CERT_FILE

FILE

Read from FILE or stdin if omitted

Global
options 
See sq(1) for a description of the global
options.
