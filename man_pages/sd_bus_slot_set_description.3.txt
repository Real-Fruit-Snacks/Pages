NAME

sd_bus_slot_set_description,
sd_bus_slot_get_description - Set or query the description
of bus slot objects

SYNOPSIS

#include

int
sd_bus_slot_set_description(sd_bus_slot* slot,
const char *description); 

int
sd_bus_slot_get_description(sd_bus_slot* bus,
const char **description); 

DESCRIPTION

sd_bus_slot_set_description()
sets the description string that is used in logging to the
specified string. The string is copied internally and freed
when the bus slot object is deallocated. The
description argument may be NULL, in which
case the description is unset.

sd_bus_slot_get_description()
returns a description string in description. If the
string is not set, e.g. with
sd_bus_slot_set_description(), and the slot is a bus
match callback slot, the match string will be returned.
Otherwise, -ENXIO is returned.

RETURN VALUE

On success,
these functions return 0 or a positive integer. On failure,
they return a negative errno-style error code.

Errors

Returned errors may indicate the following problems:

-EINVAL

An required argument is
NULL.

-ENXIO

The bus slot object has no
description.

-ENOMEM

Memory allocation failed.

NOTES

Functions
described here are available as a shared library, which can
be compiled against and linked to with the
libsystemd pkg-config(1) file.

The code
described here uses getenv(3), which is declared to
be not multi-thread-safe. This means that the code calling
the functions described here must not call setenv(3)
from a parallel thread. It is recommended to only do calls
to setenv() from an early phase of the program when
no other threads have been started.

HISTORY

sd_bus_slot_set_description()
and sd_bus_slot_get_description() were added in
version 240.
