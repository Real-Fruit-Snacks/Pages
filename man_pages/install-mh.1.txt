install-mh
&minus; initialize the nmh environment

SYNOPSIS

install&minus;mh

[&minus;auto]
[&minus;check] [&minus;version]
[&minus;help] 

DESCRIPTION

Install&minus;mh
is the nmh program to create the initial setup for a
first&minus;time nmh user. Install&minus;mh
lives in two places for historical reasons.

The
&minus;auto option does things as automatically as
possible and makes install&minus;mh less chatty.

The user is
asked for the name of the directory that will be designated
as the user&rsquo;s nmh directory. If this directory
does not exist, the user is asked if it should be created.
Normally, this directory should be under the user&rsquo;s
home directory, and has the default name of
&rsquo;&rsquo;Mail&rsquo;&rsquo;.
Install&minus;mh writes an initial .mh_profile
for the user.

As with all
nmh commands, install&minus;mh first checks
for the existence of the $MH environment variable
since that gives the profile path if set. If it isn&rsquo;t
set, the $HOME environment variable is consulted to
determine the user&rsquo;s home directory. If $HOME
is not set, then the /etc/passwd file is
consulted.

When creating
the users initial .mh_profile,
install&minus;mh will check for the existence of a
global profile /etc/nmh/mh.profile. If found, this
will be used to initialize the new .mh_profile.

The
&minus;check option can be used to check whether or
not nmh has been installed. This can be used by other
programs to determine whether or not nmh has been installed
without their having to know the internals of nmh.
