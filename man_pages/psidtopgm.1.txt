NAME
       psidtopgm - convert PostScript "image" data to a PGM image

SYNOPSIS
       psidtopgm width height bits/sample [imagedata]

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       psidtopgm  reads  the  "image" data from a PostScript file as input and
       produces a PGM image as output.

       This program is obsoleted by pstopnm.

       What follows was written before pstopnm  existed.

       This is a very simple and limited program, and is here only because  so
       many  people have asked for it.  To use it you have to manually extract
       the readhexstring data portion from your PostScript file, and then give
       the width, height, and bits/sample on the command line.  Before you at‐
       tempt this, you should at least read the description of the "image" op‐
       erator in the PostScript Language Reference Manual.

       It would probably not be too hard to write a script that uses this fil‐
       ter to read a specific variety of PostScript image, but  the  variation
       is  too great to make a general-purpose reader.  Unless, of course, you
       want to write a full-fledged PostScript interpreter...

OPTIONS
       There are no command line options defined specifically  for  psidtopgm,
       but it recognizes the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm
       (See
        Common Options ⟨index.html#commonoptions⟩ .)
