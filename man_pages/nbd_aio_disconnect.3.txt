NAME

nbd_aio_disconnect
- disconnect from the NBD server

SYNOPSIS

#include

int nbd_aio_disconnect ( 
struct nbd_handle *h, uint32_t flags 
);

DESCRIPTION

Issue the
disconnect command to the NBD server. This is not a normal
command because NBD servers are not obliged to send a reply.
Instead you should wait for nbd_aio_is_closed(3) to
become true on the connection. Once this command is issued,
you cannot issue any further commands.

Although libnbd
does not prevent you from issuing this command while still
waiting on the replies to previous commands, the NBD
protocol recommends that you wait until there are no other
commands in flight (see nbd_aio_in_flight(3)), to
give the server a better chance at a clean shutdown.

The
"flags" parameter must be 0 for now (it exists for
future NBD protocol extensions). There is no direct
synchronous counterpart; however, nbd_shutdown(3)
will call this function if appropriate.

RETURN VALUE

If the call is
successful the function returns 0.

ERRORS

On error -1 is
returned.

Refer to
"ERROR HANDLING" in libnbd(3) for how to
get further details of the error.

The following
parameters must not be NULL: "h". For more
information see "Non-NULL parameters" in
libnbd(3).
