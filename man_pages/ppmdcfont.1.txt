NAME
       ppmdcfont - Turn a Ppmdfont file into C source for a builtin font

SYNOPSIS
       ppmdcfont

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       (There are no arguments or options)

       ppmdcfont  creates a C source file that you can compile into a built-in
       font for use with the Netpbm PPM drawing facilities.  It reads a  Ppmd‐
       font  file  on  Standard Input and writes the C source code to Standard
       Output.

       The output C source code  has  the  font  object's  name  hardcoded  as
       ppmd_standardfont, which you will definitely want to edit, because that
       is the name of the font built in to libnetpbm.  If you don't change it,
       it will conflict both cognitively and in program linking.  There should
       obviously be an option on ppmdcfont to choose this, but the development
       effort has not been justified so far.

       See  Libnetpbm PPM Drawing Function Manual" (1) for details on Ppmdfont
       files.
