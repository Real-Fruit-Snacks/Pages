choose one of the following:

device
rtwn-rtl8188eufw 
device rtwn-rtl8192cfwE_B 
device rtwn-rtl8192cfwE 
device rtwn-rtl8192cfwT 
device rtwn-rtl8192cfwU 
device rtwn-rtl8192eufw 
device rtwn-rtl8812aufw 
device rtwn-rtl8821aufw

Alternatively,
to load all firmware images as a module at boot time, place
the following line in loader.conf(5):

rtwn-rtl8188eufw_load="YES"

rtwn-rtl8192cfwE_B_load="YES" 
rtwn-rtl8192cfwE_load="YES"
