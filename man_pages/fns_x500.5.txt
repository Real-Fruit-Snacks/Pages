− overview of FNS over X.500 implementation

DESCRIPTION

Federated
Naming Service (FNS) provides a method for federating
multiple naming services under a single, simple interface
for the basic naming operations. One of the naming services
supported by FNS is the X.500 Directory Service (see
ITU-T X.500 or ISO/IEC 9594). X.500 is a
global directory service. Its components cooperate to manage
information about a hierarchy of objects on a worldwide
scope. Such objects include countries, organizations,
people, services, and machines. FNS uses X.500 to
name entities globally.

FNS
provides the XFN interface for retrieval and
modification of information stored in X.500. In addition,
enterprise namespaces such as those served by NIS+
and NIS can be federated with X.500 by adding
reference information to X.500 describing how to reach the
desired next naming service. To federate a NIS+ or
NIS namespace under X.500, perform the following
steps:

1.

Obtain the root reference for the NIS+ hierarchy
or NIS domain.

2.

Enhance the X.500 schema to support the addition of
XFN references.

3.

Create an X.500 entry to store the XFN
reference. 

4.

Add the XFN reference.

The root
reference is referred to as the next naming system
reference because it refers to the next naming
system beneath X.500. This reference contains information
about how to communicate with the NIS+ or NIS
servers and has the following format:

domainname>
server name> [ server
address> ]

where
 is the fully qualified domain
name. Notice that NIS+ and NIS have slightly
different syntaxes for domain names. For NIS+, the
fully qualified domain name is case-insensitive and
terminated by a dot character (’.’). For
NIS, the fully qualified domain name is
case-sensitive and not terminated by a dot character.
For both NIS+ and NIS,  is optional. If it is not supplied, a host
name lookup will be performed to get the machine’s
address.

For example, if
the machine wiz-nisplus-server with address
133.33.33.33 serves the NIS+ domain
wiz.com., the reference would look like this:

wiz.com.
wiz-nisplus-server 133.33.33.33

For another
example, if the machine woz-nis-server serves the
NIS domain Woz.COM, the reference would look
like this:

Woz.COM
woz-nis-server

Before the next
naming system reference can be added to X.500, the X.500
schema must be altered to include the following object class
and associated attributes (defined in ASN.1
notation).
xFNSupplement OBJECT-CLASS ::= {
  SUBCLASS OF { top }
  KIND          auxiliary
  MAY CONTAIN { objectReferenceString  |  nNSReference-
String }
  ID            id-oc-xFNSupplement }

id-oc-xFNSupplement OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
  iso member-body(2) ansi(840) sun(113536) 25 }

objectReferenceString ATTRIBUTE ::= {
  WITH SYNTAX            OCTET STRING
  EQUALITY MATCHING RULE octetStringMatch
  SINGLE VALUE           TRUE
  ID                     id-at-objectReferenceString }

id-at-objectReferenceString OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
  iso member-body(2) ansi(840) sun(113536) 30 }

nNSReferenceString ATTRIBUTE ::= {
  WITH SYNTAX            OCTET STRING
  EQUALITY MATCHING RULE octetStringMatch
  SINGLE VALUE           TRUE
  ID                     id-at-nNSReferenceString }

id-at-nNSReferenceString OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
  so member-body(2) ansi(840) sun(113536) 31 }

The procedures
for altering the X.500 schema will vary from implementation
to implementation. Consult Solstice X.500 or the
schema administration guide for your X.500 product.

Once X.500
supports XFN references, the next naming system
reference can be added by first creating an X.500 object and
then adding the new reference to it. For example, the
following commands create entries for the Wiz and
Woz organizations in the U.S.A. and add the reference
information shown in the examples above to them.

For
NIS+:

example%
fnattr .../c=us/o=wiz -a objectclass \ 
top organization xfnsupplement

example%
fnbind -r .../c=us/o=wiz/ onc_fn_enterprise \ 
onc_fn_nisplus_root "wiz.com.
wiz-nisplus-server"

For
NIS:

example%
fnattr .../c=us/o=woz -a objectclass \ 
top organization xfnsupplement

example%
fnbind -r .../c=us/o=woz/ onc_fn_enterprise \ 
onc_fn_nis_root "Woz.COM woz-nis-server"

Notice the
mandatory trailing slash (’/’) in the
name argument to fnbind(1).

This
modification effectively adds the next naming system
reference to X.500. The reference may be retrieved using
fnlookup(1) to see if the information has been added
properly. For example, the following command looks up the
next naming system reference of the Wiz
organization:

example%
fnlookup -v .../c=us/o=wiz/

Note the
mandatory trailing slash.

After this
administrative step has been taken, clients outside of the
NIS+ hierarchy or NIS domain can access and
perform operations on the contexts in the NIS+
hierarchy or NIS domain. Foreign NIS+ clients
access the hierarchy as unauthenticated NIS+ clients.
Continuing the example above, and assuming that NIS+
is federated underneath the Wiz organization, the
root of the NIS+ enterprise may be listed using the
command:

example%
fnlist .../c=us/o=wiz/

Note the
mandatory trailing slash.

The next naming
system reference may be removed using the command:

example%
fnunbind .../c=us/o=wiz/

Note the
mandatory trailing slash.

NOTES

In a 64-bit
XFN application, retrieval and modification of
information stored in the X.500 directory service is not
supported.
