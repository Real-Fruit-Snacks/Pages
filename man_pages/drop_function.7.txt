NAME

DROP FUNCTION
&minus; remove a function

SYNOPSIS

DROP FUNCTION
name ( [ type [, ...] ] ) [ CASCADE | RESTRICT
]

DESCRIPTION

DROP
FUNCTION removes the definition of an existing function.
To execute this command the user must be the owner of the
function. The argument types to the function must be
specified, since several different functions may exist with
the same name and different argument lists.

PARAMETERS

name

The name (optionally
schema-qualified) of an existing function.

type

The data type of an argument of the function.

CASCADE

Automatically drop objects that
depend on the function (such as operators or triggers).

RESTRICT

Refuse to drop the function if
any objects depend on it. This is the default.

EXAMPLES

This command
removes the square root function:

DROP FUNCTION
sqrt(integer);

COMPATIBILITY

A DROP
FUNCTION statement is defined in the SQL standard, but
it is not compatible with this command.
