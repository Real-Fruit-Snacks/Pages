NAME

sq toolbox
packet - Low-level packet manipulation

SYNOPSIS

sq toolbox
packet dump [OPTIONS] FILE 
sq toolbox packet decrypt [OPTIONS] FILE

sq toolbox packet split [OPTIONS] FILE

sq toolbox packet join [OPTIONS] FILE

DESCRIPTION

Low-level
packet manipulation.

An OpenPGP data
stream consists of packets. These tools allow working with
packet streams. They are mostly of interest to developers,
but &rsquo;sq toolbox packet dump&rsquo; may be helpful to a
wider audience both to provide valuable information in bug
reports to OpenPGP-related software, and as a learning
tool.

SUBCOMMANDS

sq toolbox
packet dump 
List packets.

Creates a
human-readable description of the packet sequence.
Additionally, it can print cryptographic artifacts, and
print the raw octet stream similar to hexdump(1), annotating
specifically which bytes are parsed into OpenPGP values.

To inspect
encrypted messages, either supply the session key, or see
&rsquo;sq decrypt&rsquo; with the &rsquo;--dump&rsquo; flag,
or &rsquo;sq toolbox packet decrypt&rsquo;.

sq toolbox
packet decrypt 
Unwrap an encryption container.

Decrypts a
message, dumping the content of the encryption container
without further processing. The result is a valid OpenPGP
message that can, among other things, be inspected using
&rsquo;sq toolbox packet dump&rsquo;.

sq toolbox
packet split 
Split a message into packets.

Splitting a
packet sequence into individual packets, then recombining
them freely with &rsquo;sq toolbox packet join&rsquo; is a
great way to experiment with OpenPGP data.

The converse
operation is &rsquo;sq toolbox packet join&rsquo;.

sq toolbox
packet join 
Join packets split across files.

Splitting a
packet sequence into individual packets, then recombining
them freely with &rsquo;sq toolbox packet join&rsquo; is a
great way to experiment with OpenPGP data.

The converse
operation is &rsquo;sq toolbox packet split&rsquo;.

EXAMPLES

sq toolbox
packet dump 
Prints the packets of a certificate

sq toolbox
packet dump juliet.pgp

Prints
cryptographic artifacts of a certificate

sq toolbox
packet dump --mpis juliet.pgp

Prints a
hexdump of a certificate

sq toolbox
packet dump --hex juliet.pgp

Prints the
packets of an encrypted message

sq toolbox
packet dump --session-key AABBCC... ciphertext.pgp

sq toolbox
packet decrypt 
Unwraps the encryption revealing the signed message

sq toolbox
packet decrypt --recipient-file juliet.pgp \

ciphertext.pgp

sq toolbox
packet split 
Split a certificate into individual packets

sq toolbox
packet split juliet.pgp

sq toolbox
packet join 
Split a certificate into individual packets

sq toolbox
packet split juliet.pgp

Then join only
a subset of these packets

sq toolbox
packet join juliet.pgp-[0-3]*
