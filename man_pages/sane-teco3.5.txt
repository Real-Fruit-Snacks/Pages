sane-teco3(5)            SANE Scanner Access Now Easy            sane-teco3(5)

NAME
       sane-teco3 - SANE backend for TECO / RELISYS scanners

DESCRIPTION
       The  sane-teco3  library  implements  a  SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy)
       backend that provides access to some TECO SCSI flatbed  scanners.  This
       backend  should be considered alpha-quality software! TECO scanners are
       sold under various brands like RELYSIS, PIOTECH,  TRUST.  This  backend
       may or may not support yours.

       The scanners that should work with this backend are:

                Vendor Model                 TECO model   status
                ---------------------------  ----------  ----------
                Relisys Scorpio                VM3552     tested
                Plustek OpticPro 2400SP        VM3552     untested
                PIOTECH Splendeur 3024         VM3552     tested
                Trust Imagery 2400 SP          VM3552     tested
                Trust Imagery 4800 SP+         VM3552     tested
                Trust Imagery 9600 SP          VM3552     untested

       The  TECO VM number can usually be found at the back of the scanner. It
       is also part of the FCC ID.

       The options the backend supports can either be selected through command
       line  options  to programs like scanimage(1) or through GUI elements in
       xscanimage(1) or xsane(1).

       If you have any success with a scanner not listed here, or if  you  no‐
       tice  any  strange behavior, please report to the backend maintainer or
       to the SANE mailing list.

OPTIONS
       Valid command line options and their syntax can be listed by using:

              scanimage --help -d teco3

       Scan Mode

       --mode Black & White|Grayscale|Color
              Selects the basic mode of operation of the scanner.  The Black &
              White mode is black and white only (1 bit).  Grayscale will pro‐
              duce 256 levels of gray (8 bits).  Color will produce  a  24-bit
              color image.

       --resolution 1..1200
              Selects  the resolution for a scan. The scanner can do all reso‐
              lutions between 1 and 1200, in increments of 1.

       --preview
              Requests a preview scan. The resolution used for that scan is 22
              dpi  and  the scan area is the maximum allowed. The scan mode is
              user selected. The default is "no".

       Geometry options

       -l -t -x -y
              Control the scan area: -l sets the top left x coordinate, -t the
              top left y coordinate, -x selects the width and -y the height of
              the scan area.  All parameters are specified in  millimeters  by
              default.

OPTIONS FOR COLOR MODE ONLY
       --custom-gamma
              Allows the user to specify a gamma table (see the next 3 parame‐
              ters).

       --red-gamma-table
              Can be used to download a user defined gamma table for  the  red
              channel. The table must be 1024 bytes long.

       --green-gamma-table
              Can be used to download a user defined gamma table for the green
              channel. The table must be 1024 bytes long.

       --blue-gamma-table
              Can be used to download a user defined gamma table for the  blue
              channel. The table must be 1024 bytes long.

CONFIGURATION FILE
       The  configuration  file /etc/sane.d/teco3.conf supports only one item:
       the device name to use (eg /dev/scanner).

FILES
       /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-teco3.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-teco3.so
              The shared library implementing this backend (present on systems
              that support dynamic loading).

ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_DEBUG_TECO3
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this en‐
              vironment variable controls the debug level  for  this  backend.
              E.g.,  a  value  of 128 requests all debug output to be printed.
              Smaller levels reduce verbosity.

LIMITATIONS
       The windows TWAIN driver has many more options than this SANE  backend.
       However  they  are  only software adjustments. This backend only imple‐
       ments what the scanner can support.

BUGS
       Not much.
