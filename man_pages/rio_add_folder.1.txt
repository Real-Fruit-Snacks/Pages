NAME

rio_add_folder
− create folders on Rio 500 flash memory

SYNOPSIS

rio_add_folder
[options] folder_1 [... folder_N]

DESCRIPTION

The
rio_add_folder command is used to create folders on
the Rio 500 flash memory. At least one folder must be
created before any files may be uploaded. Folders cannot
span memory devices, so you’ll probably want to create
at least two if you have a smartmedia card.

OPTIONS

−f
name, −−fontname name

Specifies the font file (.fon)
to be used for the Rio display.

−h,
−−help

Display a short usage
summary.

−n x,
−−fontnumber x

Selects a specific font within
the selected .fon file, when multiple fonts are present. The
default is `0´.

−v,
−−version

Display program version.

−x,
−−external

Create folders on the external
smartmedia card, rather than using the internal memory.
