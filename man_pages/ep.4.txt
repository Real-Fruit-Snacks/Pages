EP(4) BSD/i386 Kernel Interfaces Manual EP(4)

NAME

ep &mdash; Ethernet
driver for 3Com Etherlink III (3c5x9) interfaces

SYNOPSIS

To compile this driver into the
kernel, place the following line in your kernel
configuration file:

device
ep

Alternatively,
to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following line in loader.conf(5):

if_ep_load="YES"

DEPRECATION NOTICE

The ep driver is not
present in FreeBSD 13.0 and later. See
https://github.com/freebsd/fcp/blob/master/fcp-0101.md for
more information.

DESCRIPTION

The ep device driver
supports network adapters based on the 3Com 3C5x9 Etherlink
III Parallel Tasking chipset.

Various models
of these cards come with a different assortment of
connectors:

AUI/DIX

Standard 15 pin
connector, also known as 10base5 (thick-net)

10Base2

BNC, also known
as thin-net

10BaseT

UTP, also known
as twisted pair

The default port
to use is the port that has been selected with the setup
utility. To override this, use the following media options
with ifconfig(8) or in your /etc/rc.conf file.

10base5/AUI

Use the AUI
port.

10base2/BNC

Use the BNC
port.

10baseT/UTP

Use the UTP
port.

Farallon EtherWave and EtherMac
PC Card (P/n 595/895 with BLUE arrow)

NOTES

The 3c509 card has no jumpers to
set the address. 3Com supplies software to set the address
of the card in software. To find the card on the ISA bus,
the kernel performs a complex scan operation at IO address
0x110. Beware! Avoid placing other cards at that
address!

Furthermore, the
3c509 should not be configured in EISA mode.

Cards in PnP
mode may conflict with other resources in the system. Ensure
your BIOS is configured correctly to exclude resources used
by the 3c509, especially IRQs, to avoid unpredictable
behavior.

Many different
companies sold the 3Com PC Cards under their own private
label. These cards also work.

The Farallon
EtherWave and EtherMac card came in two varieties. The
ep driver supports the 595 and 895 cards. These cards
have the blue arrow on the front along with a 3Com logo. The
Farallon 595a cards, which have a red arrow on the front,
are also called EtherWave and EtherMac. They are supported
by the sn(4) driver.

DIAGNOSTICS

ep0: reset (status:
%x)  The driver has encountered a FIFO underrun or
overrun. The driver will reset the card and the packet will
be lost. This is not fatal.

ep0: eeprom
failed to come ready  The eeprom failed to come
ready. This probably means the card is wedged.

ep0: 3c509 in
test mode. Erase pencil mark!  This means that
someone has scribbled with pencil in the test area on the
card. Erase the pencil mark and reboot. (This is not a
joke).

ep0: No I/O
space?!  The driver was unable to allocate the I/O
space that it thinks should be there. Look for conflicts
with other devices.

ep0: No
irq?!  The driver could not allocate the interrupt
it wanted. Look for conflicts, although sharing interrupts
for PC Card is normal.

ep0: No
connectors!  The driver queried the hardware for
what ethernet attachment were present, but the hardware
reported none that the driver recognized.

ep0: Unable
to get Ethernet address!  The driver was unable to
read the ethernet address from the EEPROM. This is likely
the result of the card being wedged.

ep0:
if_alloc() failed  The driver was unable to
allocate a ifnet structure. This may happen in extremely low
memory conditions.

ep0: strange
connector type in EEPROM: assuming AUI  The driver
does not know what to do with the information the EEPROM has
about connectors, so it is assuming the worst.

ep0: unknown
ID 0xXXXXXXXX  The driver has found an ID that it
believes it supports, but does not have a specific
identification string to present to the user.

ep0:
 at port 0x%03x in EISA mode, ignored. 
The 3C509 ISA card is in EISA mode. The card will be ignored
until it is taken out of EISA mode.

ep0:
 at x0%03x in PnP mode  This card appears
to be in Plug and Play mode. It should be probed as part of
the plug and play phase of the ISA probes.

ep0: Invalid
EEPROM checksum!  The EEPROM has a bad checksum, so
the driver is ignoring the card.

ep0:
bus_setup_intr() failed!  The driver was unable to
setup the interrupt handler. This should never happen.
