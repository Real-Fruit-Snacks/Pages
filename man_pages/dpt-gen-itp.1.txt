dpt-gen-itp --
generate ITP trivia

SYNOPSIS

"dpt
gen-itp > tmp && $EDITOR tmp && sendmail

DESCRIPTION

dpt
gen-itp can help in constructing the Intent To
Package bug report which is to be filed when one starts
working on a package. The script itself doesn’t send
the mail, but prepares the boiler-plate so that you
don’t have to worry about the proper format or other
trivia.

dpt
gen-itp gets the information from debian/control
and debian/copyright, so filling up these files with
real data will help.
