NAME

cosd &minus;
ceph object storage daemon

SYNOPSIS

cosd
&minus;i osdnum [
&minus;&minus;osd&minus;data datapath ] [
&minus;&minus;osd&minus;journal journal ] [
&minus;&minus;mkfs ]

DESCRIPTION

cosd is
the object storage daemon for the Ceph distributed file
system. It is responsible for storing objects on a local
file system and providing access to them over the
network.

The
datapath argument should be a directory on a btrfs
file system where the object data resides. The
journal is optional, and is only useful
performance-wise when it resides on a different disk than
datapath with low latency (ideally, an NVRAM
device).

OPTIONS

&minus;D

Debug mode: do not daemonize
after startup (run in foreground) and send log output to
stdout. 

&minus;f

do not daemonize after startup (run in foreground), but
log to the usual location. Useful when run via
crun(8). 

&minus;&minus;osd&minus;data
osddata

&minus;&minus;osd&minus;journal

&minus;&minus;mkfs

mkcephfs(8). 

&minus;c
ceph.conf,
&minus;&minus;conf=ceph.conf

Use ceph.conf
configuration file instead of the default
/etc/ceph/ceph.conf for runtime configuration
options.

&minus;m
monaddress[:port]

Connect to specified monitor
(instead of looking through ceph.conf).
