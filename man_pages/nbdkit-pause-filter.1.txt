NAME

nbdkit-pause-filter
- pause NBD requests

SYNOPSIS

nbdkit
--filter=pause PLUGIN [PLUGIN-ARGS...]
pause-control=SOCKET

DESCRIPTION

"nbdkit-pause-filter"
is a filter for nbdkit(1) which can temporarily stop
NBD requests from being handled by nbdkit, and later resume
them. This filter can be used if you need to take a snapshot
of the underlying storage.

Control
socket 
The "pause-control" parameter is the name of a
Unix domain socket which the filter listens for commands
on.

To pause NBD
request processing you send character 'p' to the socket. Any
NBD requests received afterwards will hang until you resume
processing.

To resume
processing you send character 'r' to the socket.

So you can know
when pausing/resuming has taken effect, the filter echos
back the character over the socket in uppercase (ie. either
'P' or 'R'). When pausing, the 'P' response is not sent
until all outstanding NBD requests (received before the
pause) have been completed. This usually means the plugin is
idle, although be aware that it is possible for plugins to
create background threads and do work that the filter cannot
"see".

Any unknown
commands are ignored. The filter responds with 'X'.

EXAMPLE

Pick a large
file, disk image or ISO, serve it over NBD, and start
copying it:

nbdkit
--filter=pause --filter=rate \ 
file BIG_FILE.ISO rate=10M pause-control=sock \ 
--run 'qemu-img convert -p $nbd /var/tmp/out'

To cause the
copy to appear to hang, do:

echo p | nc -U
sock

To resume
activity:

echo r | nc -U
sock

PARAMETERS

pause-control=SOCKET

The Unix domain socket for
controlling the filter. See "Control socket"
above.

NOTES

If you are
connecting a kernel client, virtual machine or similar to
nbdkit then only short pauses are tolerated, and you will
soon get timeout errors. The timeouts are not generated by
nbdkit, but by the client itself.

The pause
filter does not flush requests to disk, although this is a
possible future enhancement.

A virtual
machine with multiple disks connected through multiple
nbdkit instances cannot get a consistent snapshot using this
filter, since even if you send the pause commands to all
instances at the same time they will be processed at
slightly different times (and this can matter if a virtual
machine is doing something like RAID across the disks). This
is not something that can be solved at the level of
individual devices, the only way to solve this is at the
hypervisor level.
