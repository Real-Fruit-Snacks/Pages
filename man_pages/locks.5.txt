NAME

locks &minus;
libzypp locking file

DESCRIPTION

The file
/etc/zypp/locks is read by libzypp at start&minus;up
if zypp.conf allows it. The entries are used for
initial locking of packages. Locking a package means not
allowing to install or uninstall it.

Valid entries
are of the form:

attribute:
value

Where attributes and their
values are described below.

Locks are
separated by an empty lines.

ATTRIBUTES

All attributes
are lower&minus;case.

repo

specifies repository
restriction. Only alias is accepted. 
By default all repositories match.

type

resolvable type restriction.
The values can be package, patch,
pattern, product and srcpackage. 
By default all types match.

case_sensitive

if strings are matched case
sensitive. The values are true, false,
on, off. 
The default is case insensitive.

install_status

status of object. Possible
states are installed, not&minus;installed and
all. If more install statuses are specified then the
last one is used. The values are installed for all
packages which are installed, non&minus;installed for
packages which can be installed or reinstalled and
all for both. 
The default is all.

match_type

type of string matching in
values. Does not affect type and repo which
must be specified exactly. The values are exact,
substring, regex for regular expressions,
glob for matching as on the command line, and
word. 
The default is substring.

query_string

String to be matched in
multiple attributes. Should be restricted by another
attribute with empty value (it is recommended, because
without restriction expect some performance problems).

version

Restrict the lock only to some
versions. It contains two parts: an optional operator and
the version. 
The operator is ==, !=, ,
>, &lArr;, >=. If operator is not
specified then == is used. 
The version has the format
[epoch:+]+version[&minus;&rsquo;release'].

Example: version: 

solvable_name

name of object (e.g.
zypper)

solvable_summary

summary of object

solvable_arch

architecture of object (e.g.
x86_64, i586)

solvable_description

description of object

solvable_eula

license text of objects which
request accepting license by user

solvable_license

license of package (only for
package) (e.g. GPL2)

solvable_keywords

keywords which specify package
(only for package)

solvable_authors

authors of package (only for
package)

solvable_group

package group (only for
package) (e.g. Development/Tools/Version Control )

update_reference_type

reference for update (e.g.
bugzilla,cve) (only for patches)

EXAMPLES

Exact
Package

This is the way YaST UI does
it. Lock k3b (e.g. you don&rsquo;t want to update it).

&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;locks&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;

type: package 
solvable_name: k3b 
match_type: exact 
case_sensitive: on

Package
Wildcard

This is the way "zypper
addlock
cross&minus;*&minus;gcc&minus;icecream&minus;backend"
does it.

&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;locks&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;

type: package 
solvable_name:
cross&minus;*&minus;gcc&minus;icecream&minus;backend 
match_type: glob 
case_sensitive: on

Versioned
Lock

Do not install new GCC. This
format is used when converting from the openSUSE&minus;10.3
lock format.

&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;locks&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;

solvable_name: gcc

Anything
named KDE

Locks everything which contains
kde in the name.

Anything
mentioning KDE

Locks everything which contains
kde in the name, summary, or description.
