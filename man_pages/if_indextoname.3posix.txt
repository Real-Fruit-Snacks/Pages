PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       if_indextoname — map a network interface  index  to  its  corresponding
       name

SYNOPSIS
       #include <net/if.h>

       char *if_indextoname(unsigned ifindex, char *ifname);

DESCRIPTION
       The  if_indextoname() function shall map an interface index to its cor‐
       responding name.

       When this function is called, ifname shall point  to  a  buffer  of  at
       least  {IF_NAMESIZE} bytes. The function shall place in this buffer the
       name of the interface with index ifindex.

RETURN VALUE
       If ifindex is an interface index, then the function  shall  return  the
       value  supplied  in ifname, which points to a buffer now containing the
       interface name. Otherwise, the function shall return a null pointer and
       set errno to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The if_indextoname() function shall fail if:

       ENXIO  The interface does not exist.
