NAME

axctl -
Configure/Kill running AX.25 connections.

SYNOPSIS

axctl [-v]
port dest src window|t1|t2|t3|n2|idle|paclen|kill
[parm]

DESCRIPTION

The
axctl command is designed to be a multi-function
command that allows miscellaneous commands to be issued to
the Linux AX.25 protocol layer for existing AX.25
connections. The connection is uniquely identified via the
combination of port, destination callsign and source
callsign, with that information the kernel is able to change
the parameters, or abort the connection.

Many of the
options are similar to those found in axparms and
perform the same function. Only one parameter may be changed
on each invocation of axctl.
