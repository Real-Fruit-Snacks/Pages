setup(2)                      System Calls Manual                     setup(2)

NAME
       setup - setup devices and filesystems, mount root filesystem

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <unistd.h>

       int setup(void);

DESCRIPTION
       setup()  is  called  once from within linux/init/main.c.  It calls ini‐
       tialization functions for devices and filesystems configured  into  the
       kernel and then mounts the root filesystem.

       No  user  process  may  call setup().  Any user process, even a process
       with superuser permission, will receive EPERM.

RETURN VALUE
       setup() always returns -1 for a user process.

ERRORS
       EPERM  Always, for a user process.

VERSIONS
       Since Linux 2.1.121, no such function exists anymore.

STANDARDS
       This function is Linux-specific, and should not be used in programs in‐
       tended to be portable, or indeed in any programs at all.

NOTES
       The calling sequence varied: at some times setup() has had a single ar‐
       gument void *BIOS and at other times a single argument int magic.
