NAME

virt-p2v-make-kiwi
- Build the virt-p2v kiwi configuration

SYNOPSIS

virt-p2v-make-kiwi
[--inject-ssh-identity path] [-o kiwi-folder]

DESCRIPTION

virt-p2v(1)
converts a physical machine to run virtualized on
KVM, managed by libvirt, OpenStack, oVirt,
Red Hat Enterprise Virtualisation ( RHEV ),
or one of the other targets supported by
virt-v2v(1).

Kiwi is a tool
used mainly by SUSE Linux Enterprise and
openSUSE to build live CDs, make appliances and so on. It is
driven by a few files including an xml description of the
machine.

virt-p2v-make-kiwi
builds a folder containing all the pieces needed for kiwi to
build a bootable P2V live CD ISO, USB key, or
PXE image. This tool only builds the kiwi
configuration, but this manual page describes some of the
ways you can use the kiwi configuration.

The root user
on the disk image uses "p2v" as its initial
password.

BUILDING THE KIWI CONFIGURATION

Using
virt-p2v-make-kiwi is very simple:

virt-p2v-make-kiwi

will build a
kiwi configuration based on the current machine’s
distribution.

To control the
name of the output folder, use the -o parameter.

BUILDING A LIVE CD / ISO

Once you have
the kiwi configuration folder, you can use kiwi(1) to
make a live CD:

sudo kiwi
--build p2v.kiwi -d build --type iso

Before running
this, you may have to tweak the "config.xml" file
to change the locale and keyboard mapping to the one you
need.

If running on a
SUSE Linux Entreprise Server, add the path to
your packages repositories using the
"--ignore-repos" and "--add-repo" kiwi
parameters.

The generated
ISO image will be placed in the
"build" folder.

BUILDING A BOOTABLE USB KEY

Use the
dd(1) program to write the ISO created
above to a USB key:

sudo dd
if=path/to/p2v.iso of=/dev/sdX

BUILDING A PXE BOOT IMAGE

To create a
PXE boot image, run kiwi in such a way:

sudo kiwi
--build $PWD/p2v.kiwi -d build --add-profile netboot --type
pxe

For more
details on how to use the generated image, report to the
kiwi documentation on PXE images:
https://doc.opensuse.org/projects/kiwi/doc/#chap.pxe

ADDING AN SSH IDENTITY

You can inject
an SSH identity (private key) file to the
kiwi config and hence into the ISO using the
--inject-ssh-identity option. Note that you
cannot inject a key once the ISO has
been built.

First create a
key pair. It must have an empty passphrase:

ssh-keygen -t
rsa -N '' -f id_rsa

This creates a
private key ("id_rsa") and a public key
("id_rsa.pub") pair. The public key should be
appended to the "authorized_keys" file on the
virt-v2v conversion server (usually to
"/root/.ssh/authorized_keys").

The private key
should be added to the kiwi config and then discarded:

virt-p2v-make-kiwi
[...] --inject-ssh-identity id_rsa 
rm id_rsa

The
ISO can then be built from the kickstart in
the usual way (see above), and it will contain the embedded
SSH identity (/var/tmp/id_rsa).

When booting
virt-p2v, specify the URL of the injected
file like this:

│ User
name: [root_____________________________] │ 
│ │ 
│ Password: [  ] │

│ │ 
│ SSH Identity URL:
[file:///var/tmp/id_rsa___________] │

or if using the
kernel command line, add:

p2v.identity=file:///var/tmp/id_rsa

For more
information, see " SSH IDENTITIES"
in virt-p2v(1).

OPTIONS

--help

Display help.

--inject-ssh-identity
id_rsa

Add an SSH
identity (private key) file into the kickstart. See "
ADDING AN SSH IDENTITY" above.

-o OUTPUT

--output OUTPUT

Write kiwi configuration to the
"OUTPUT" folder. If not specified, the default is
p2v.kiwi in the current directory.

-V

--version

Display version number and
exit.

FILES

$libdir/virt-p2v/virt-p2v.xz

The virt-p2v(1) binary
which is copied into the kiwi configuration.

The location of
the binary can be changed by setting the
"VIRT_P2V_DATA_DIR" environment variable.

$datadir/virt-p2v/issue 
$datadir/virt-p2v/launch-virt-p2v.in 
$datadir/virt-p2v/kiwi 
$datadir/virt-p2v/p2v.service

Various data files that are
used to make the kiwi appliance.

The location of
these files can be changed by setting the
"VIRT_P2V_DATA_DIR" environment variable.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

"VIRT_P2V_DATA_DIR"

The directory where
virt-p2v-make-kiwi looks for data files and the virt-p2v
binary (see " FILES" above). If not
set, a compiled-in location is used.
