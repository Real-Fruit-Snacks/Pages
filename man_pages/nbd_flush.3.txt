NAME

nbd_flush -
send flush command to the NBD server

SYNOPSIS

#include

int nbd_flush ( 
struct nbd_handle *h, uint32_t flags 
);

DESCRIPTION

Issue the flush
command to the NBD server. The function should return when
all write commands which have completed have been committed
to permanent storage on the server. Note this will generally
return an error if nbd_can_flush(3) is false.

The
"flags" parameter must be 0 for now (it exists for
future NBD protocol extensions).

By default,
libnbd will reject attempts to use this function with
parameters that are likely to result in server failure, such
as requesting an unknown command flag. The
nbd_set_strict_mode(3) function can be used to alter
which scenarios should await a server reply rather than
failing fast.

RETURN VALUE

If the call is
successful the function returns 0.

ERRORS

On error -1 is
returned.

Refer to
"ERROR HANDLING" in libnbd(3) for how to
get further details of the error.

The following
parameters must not be NULL: "h". For more
information see "Non-NULL parameters" in
libnbd(3).

HANDLE STATE

nbd_flush can
be called when the handle is in the following state:

┌─────────────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────┐

│ Connecting │ ❌ error │ 
│ Connecting & handshaking (opt_mode) │
❌ error │

│ Handle dead │ ❌ error │ 

└─────────────────────────────────────┴─────────────────────────┘

VERSION

This function
