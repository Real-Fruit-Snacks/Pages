NAME

triangle -
reference element (rheolef-7.2)

DESCRIPTION

The triangle
reference_element(6) is K = [0,1].

K = { 0 

x1 
2 
| + 
| + 
| + 
| + 
0---------1 x0

This
two-dimensional reference_element(6) is then
transformed, after the Piola geometrical application, as a
triangle in a 2D or 3D physical space, as a
geo_element(6).

Curved high
order transformed geo_element(6) Pk triangle (k >=
1) are supported for 2D or 3D geometries. In these cases,
the nodes of an high-order triangle are numbered as:

Note that
high-order triangles have additional edge-nodes and
face-nodes. These nodes are numbered as: first vertices,
then edge-nodes, following the edge numbering order and
orientation, and finally the face internal nodes, following
the triangle lattice.
