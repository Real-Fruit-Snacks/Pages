DESCRIPTION

sload.f2fs
is used to load directories and files into a disk partition,
or an F2FS image (file). device could a special file
corresponding to the device (e.g. /dev/sdXX), or an
F2FS image file.

The exit code
returned by sload.f2fs is 0 on success and -1 on
failure.

OPTIONS

-f
source-directory-path

Specify the source directory
path to be loaded.

-t
mount-point-path

Specify the mount point path in
the partition to load.

-d
debug-level

Specify the level of debugging
options. The default number is 0, which shows basic
debugging messages.

-P

Preserve owner: user and group. The user and group of
the source files will be taken into account.

-c

Enable a cluster-based file compression. The file would
be chopped into clusters, and each cluster is compressed
independently. 

-L
log-of-blocks-per-cluster

Specify cluster size in power
of two blocks. The minimum value is 2 (4 blocks, default).
The maximum value is 8 (256 blocks). Note that a block
contains 4096 bytes. This option must be used with option
-c.

-a
compression-algorithm

Choose the algorithm for
compression. Available options are: lzo, lz4 (default). This
option must be used with option -c.

-i
file-extension-to-include-for-compression

Specify a file extension to
include for the compression. To specify multiple file
extensions, use multiple option -i’s. Files
having one of the listed extensions will be compressed. This
option must be used with option -c.

-x
file-extension-to-exclude-from-compression

Specify a file extension to
exclude from compression. To specify multiple file
extensions, use multiple option -x’s. Files
having one of the listed extensions won’t be
compressed. This option must be used with option
-c.

-m
minimum-compressed-blocks-per-cluster

Specify a minimum block count
saved (by compression) per cluster. The minimum value is 1
(default). Maximum value is the cluster size in blocks minus
1. If compression of a cluster fails to save at least the
minimum compressed block count given by the option, the
cluster will not be compressed. This option must be used
with option -c.

-r

Specify read-only flag for the compressed files. It
allows filesystem to release compressed space to the users,
since, without this option, filesystem should keep the space
for future file updates. This option must be used with
option -c.

NOTES

If neither
-i nor -x is used, all files will be
compressed. Obviously, option -i and -x can
not be used together.
