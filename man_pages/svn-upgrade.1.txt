NAME

svn-upgrade
&minus; upgrade source package from a new upstream
revision

SYNOPSIS

svn&minus;upgrade newsource
[options] 

DESCRIPTION

svn&minus;upgrade
modifies a Debian package source located in a Subversion
repository, upgrading it to a new upstream release. The
repository filesystem tree must be in the format created by
svn&minus;inject.

OPTIONS

svn&minus;upgrade
accepts the following options on the command&minus;line:

&minus;V
STRING | &minus;&minus;version STRING

Forces a different upstream
version string

Default:
Off.

&minus;c
| &minus;&minus;clean

Runs make clean and
removes the debian/ directory in the new source.

Default:
Off.

&minus;P
STRING | &minus;&minus;packagename STRING

Forces a different package
name

Default:
Off.

&minus;v
| &minus;&minus;verbose

More verbose program output

Default:
Off.

&minus;r
| &minus;&minus;replay&minus;conflicting

Extra cleanup run: replaces all
conflicting files with upstream versions. Review of svn
status output before doing that could make sense.

Default:
Off.

&minus;N
| &minus;&minus;noautodch

Upgrade without making a new
changelog entry.

Default: Make
the changelog entry.

&minus;u
| &minus;&minus;uscan

the new version.

&minus;&minus;noninteractive

Turn off interactive mode.

&minus;&minus;ignoreerrors

In noninteractive mode, ignore
errors.

&minus;&minus;ignored&minus;files&minus;action
STRING

Make files that are ignored due
to subversion ignore patterns to be 'import'ed or
'skip'ed.

&minus;e
| &minus;&minus;auto&minus;epoch

Automatically increase version
epoch if the new upstream version is not greater than the
current.

&minus;&minus;debclean

Run debclean before
merging the new upstream source.

Tarballs must
be compressed with gzip or bzip2.
