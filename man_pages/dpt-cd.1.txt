NAME

dpt-cd - change
to packageâ€™s working directory

SYNOPSIS

dpt cd
package-name

DESCRIPTION

dpt
cd puts you in the working copy for the packaging of
a given package.

It does not try
to update the checkout, nor create it if it does not exist.
Use dpt-checkout(1) for that.

It is a
shortcut for when you know that the given checkout is up to
date or when you are offline.

CAVEATS

Programs cannot
change the working directory of the shell. In order to
achieve this you should integrate dpt with your
shell. See dpt-shell-lib(1) for instructions.

CONFIGURATION

dpt
checkout requires the "DPT_PACKAGES"
environment variable.

See
dpt-config(5) for details.
