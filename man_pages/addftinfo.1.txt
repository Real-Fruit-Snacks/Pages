Description

addftinfo
reads an AT&T troff font description file
font, adds additional font metric information
required by GNU troff(1), and writes the
combined result to the standard output. The information
added is derived from the font’s existing parameters
and assumptions about traditional troff names for
characters. Among the font metrics added are the heights and
depths of characters (how far each extends vertically above
and below the baseline). The resolution and
unit-width arguments should be the same as the
corresponding parameters in the DESC file.
font is the name of the file describing the font; if
font ends with “I”, the font is
assumed to be oblique (or italic).

Options

--help
displays a usage message, while -v and
--version show version information; all exit
afterward.

All other
options change parameters that are used to derive the
heights and depths. Like the existing quantities in the font
description file, each value n is in scaled
points, inches/resolution for a font whose type
size is unit-width; see groff_font(5). 
-asc-height n

height of characters with
ascenders, such as “b”, “d”, or
“l”

-body-depth n

depth of characters such as
parentheses

-body-height n

height of characters such as
parentheses

-cap-height n

height of uppercase letters
such as “A”

-comma-depth n

depth of a comma

-desc-depth n

depth of characters with
descenders, such as “p”, “q”, or
“y”

-fig-height

height of figures
(numerals)

-x-height n

height of lowercase letters
without ascenders such as “x”

addftinfo
makes no attempt to use the specified parameters to infer
unspecified parameters. If a parameter is not specified, the
default will be used. The defaults are chosen to produce
reasonable values for a Times font.
