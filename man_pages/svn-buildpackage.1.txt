NAME

svn-buildpackage
&minus; build Debian packages from SVN repository

SYNOPSIS

svn&minus;buildpackage
[[ OPTIONS... ] [ OPTIONS for dpkg&minus;buildpackage ]] 

DESCRIPTION

Builds a Debian
package from a Subversion repository. The source code
repository must be in the format created by
svn&minus;inject, and this script must be executed
from the working directory (trunk/package).

By default, the
working directory is used as the main source directory
(assuming the whole upstream source is being stored in the
repository). The alternative is so called "merge
mode". With this method, only the debian directory (and
maybe some other modified files) are stored in the
repository. At build time, the contents of the svn trunk are
copied to the extracted tarball contents (and can overwrite
parts of it). To choose this working model, set the
svn property mergeWithUpstream on the debian
directory

$ svn propset
mergeWithUpstream 1 debian

mergeWithUpstream
requires that the build system can prepare a tarball,
typically using make dist and autotools. All upstream
packages will have some form of tarball creation support and
native packages that use autotools or which have internal
tarball support can use mergeWithUpstream to handle
generated files that are needed to build the package but are
not present in SVN. See the HOWTO guide for examples of how
this can be done. Native packages that do not use autotools
and do not have internal tarball support can still add
generated files to the source package tarball using the
useNativeDist make target in the top level Makefile.
This custom target must be idempotent and only modify /
generate the desired files using only the exported SVN
source and build dependencies. To allow
svn&minus;buildpackage to use an make
native&minus;dist target in your top level Makefile, set
the useNativeDist property on the ./debian/
directory:

$ svn propset
useNativeDist 1 debian

The default
behaviour of svn&minus;buildpackage is as
follows:

Check the
working directory, complain on uncommited files (also see
&minus;&minus;svn&minus;ignore&minus;new)

Copy the orig
tarball to the build area if necessary (also see
&minus;&minus;svn&minus;no&minus;links)

Extract the
tarball (in merge mode) or export the svn work directory to
the build directory (also see below and
&minus;&minus;svn&minus;no&minus;links)

Build with
dpkg&minus;buildpackage (also see
&minus;&minus;svn&minus;builder,
&minus;&minus;svn&minus;lintian, etc.)

Create a
changelog entry for the future version

OPTIONS

svn&minus;buildpackage
accepts the following options on the command&minus;line:

&minus;&minus;svn&minus;builder=COMMAND

Specifies alternative build
command instead of dpkg&minus;buildpackage, eg.
debuild, pdebuild, etc. Every parameter that
svn&minus;buildpackage doesn't know
(&minus;&minus;svn&minus;*) is passed to
COMMAND. There is no difference between the command
line and config file parameters . They are used at the same
time.

WARNING: shell
quotation rules do not completely apply here, better use
wrappers for complex constructs. Using this option may break
&minus;&minus;svn&minus;lintian and
&minus;&minus;svn&minus;move functionality. Some
functions may be disabled when a custom build command is
used because the output file location is not
predictable.

Default: use
dpkg&minus;buildpackage.

&minus;&minus;svn&minus;ignore&minus;new
| &minus;&minus;svn&minus;ignore

Don't stop on svn conflicts or
new/changed files. To set this behaviour for single files
set the deb:ignoreM property to 1 on them. Also see
documentation of the svn:ignore property in the SVN
book.

Default: Stop
on conflicts or new/changed files.

&minus;&minus;svn&minus;dont&minus;clean

Don't run debian/rules
clean.

Default: clean
first

&minus;&minus;svn&minus;no&minus;links

Don't use file links but try to
export or do hard copies of the working directory. This is
useful if your package fails to build because some files,
empty directories, broken links, ... cannot be transported
with in the default link&minus;copy mode.

Default: use
links where possible.

&minus;&minus;svn&minus;dont&minus;purge

Don't remove the build
directory when the build is done.

Default: remove
after successful build.

&minus;&minus;svn&minus;reuse

If possible, reuse an existing
build directory in subsequent builds. The build directory is
not purged after the build, it is not renamed when a build
starts and the files are just copied over into it. Useful in
mergeWithUpstream mode with large packages.

Default: build
directory is removed.

&minus;&minus;svn&minus;rm&minus;prev&minus;dir

If a previous build directory
is found, remove it before building instead of renaming it.
If &minus;&minus;svn&minus;reuse is also given in the
same line, the reuse behaviour occurs.

Default: rename
old directories with a 'obsolete' suffix.

&minus;&minus;svn&minus;export

Just export the working
directory and do necessary code merge operations, then
exit.

Default:
Off.

&minus;&minus;svn&minus;tag

Final build: Tag, export, build
cleanly & make new changelog entry.

Default:
Off.

&minus;&minus;svn&minus;tag&minus;only
| &minus;&minus;svn&minus;only&minus;tag

Don't build the package, do
only the tag copy.

Default:
Off.

&minus;&minus;svn&minus;retag

If an existing target directory
has been found while trying to create the tag copy, remove
the target directory first.

Default:
Off.

&minus;&minus;svn&minus;noautodch

No new Debian changelog entry
is added automatically.

Default: A new
UNRELEASED changelog entry is set via dch.

&minus;&minus;svn&minus;lintian

Run lintian on the resulting
changes file when done.

Default:
Off.

&minus;&minus;svn&minus;move

When done, move the created
files (as listed in .changes) to the parent directory,
relative to the one where svn&minus;buildpackage was
started.

Default:
Off.

&minus;&minus;svn&minus;move&minus;to=...

Specifies the target directory
to which to move the generated files.

Default: Off.
(Files are left where the build command puts them.)

&minus;&minus;svn&minus;pkg=packagename

Overrides the detected package
name. Use with caution since it could be set too late during
the processing (eg. still have the old value when expanding
shell variables).

Default:
Off.

&minus;&minus;svn&minus;arch=ARCH

Allows specifying the build
architecture (e.g. i386 build on an amd64 machine).

Default:
Off.

&minus;&minus;svn&minus;override=var=value,anothervar=value

Overrides any config variable
that has been autodetected or found in
.svn/deb&minus;layout.

Default:
Off.

&minus;&minus;svn&minus;prebuild
| &minus;&minus;svn&minus;postbuild |
&minus;&minus;svn&minus;pretag |
&minus;&minus;svn&minus;posttag

Commands (hooks) to be executed
before/after the build/tag command invocations, e.g. to
download the orig tarballs from the archive. Shell code can
be emdded here though it is not recommended. Various helping
variables are available in the environment, see ENVIRONMENT
VARIABLES below for detailed explanation.

Please note
that the prebuild and postbuild hooks replace the normal
prebuild and postbuild actions of
svn&minus;buildpackage. For prebuild, this means that
the build dependencies will not be checked. For postbuild,
this means that the resulting files won't be moved, and
lintian will not be run.

Defaults:
Off.

&minus;&minus;svn&minus;noninteractive

With this parameter
svn&minus;buildpackage will not interact with the
user.

Default:
Off.

&minus;&minus;svn&minus;savecfg

By default,
svn&minus;buildpackage used to create
.svn/deb&minus;layout on every invocation. Since version
0.6.22 this behaviour is deprecated.

With this
parameter svn&minus;buildpackage will (partly)
replicate the old behaviour. In contrast to the deprecated
behaviour, the .svn/deb&minus;layout is regarded as a
local override; the old behaviour simply ignored any
versioned layout information if it found
.svn/deb&minus;layout.

This option was
provided since it can be useful when creating a local
override file.

Default:
Off.

&minus;&minus;svn&minus;download&minus;orig

This option makes
svn&minus;buildpackage try to download the upstream
tarball using apt and uscan.

Default:
Off.

&minus;&minus;svn&minus;verbose

More verbose program
output.

Default:
Off.

&minus;h
| &minus;&minus;help

Show the help message.

EXAMPLES

For more
detailed information on how to use
svn&minus;buildpackage, see the HOWTO
http://svn&minus;bp.alioth.debian.org/
[1]
.

To
start working with existing native Debian package from a
*.dsc file, import it into the repository with
command:

svn&minus;inject
package_0.1.dsc svn://host/debian/devel/packages

To
start working with existing upstream package in Debian from
a *.dsc file, import it into the repository with
command:

svn&minus;inject
&minus;o package_0.1&minus;2.dsc
svn://host/debian/devel/packages

Before
building an upstream package, ensure the original source is
available, e.g. if uscan is working:

svn
mkdir ../tarballs 
svn propset svn:ignore "*" ../tarballs 
uscan &minus;&minus;force&minus;download
&minus;&minus;destdir ../tarballs

To
test building the package from Subversion repository, use
command below. Refer to dpkg-buildpackage(1) manual
page for the &minus;us etc. options:

svn&minus;buildpackage
&minus;&minus;svn&minus;lintian &minus;us &minus;uc
&minus;rfakeroot

To
check that package build in a clean state, test it with
pbuilder(1):

svn
mkdir ../build&minus;area # To store results 
svn propset svn:ignore "*" ../build&minus;area

svn&minus;buildpackage
&minus;&minus;svn&minus;ignore&minus;new
&minus;&minus;svn&minus;builder=pdebuild

When
a new upstream release becomes available, commit all changes
and have the working tree in clean state. Then use
svn-upgrade(1) to import the new release:

svn
status # Check that there are no uncommited changes 
svn&minus;upgrade &minus;&minus;verbose
../package&minus;2.0.tar.gz

CONFIGURATION FILE

svn&minus;buildpackage's
behaviour can be modified using the file
~/.svn&minus;buildpackage.conf. Additional parts can be
added in each package working directory using the file
.svn/svn&minus;buildpackage.conf. It is essentially a list
of the long command line options (without leading minus
signs), one argument per line (without quotes surrounding
multi&minus;word arguments). The variables are expanded with
the system shell if shell variables are found there. Avoid ~
sign because of unreliable expansion: it is better to use
$HOME instead. Example:

svn&minus;builder=debuild
&minus;EPATH 
svn&minus;no&minus;links 
svn&minus;override=origDir=$HOME/debian/upstream/$PACKAGE

# svn&minus;ignore&minus;new 
#svn&minus;lintian

DIRECTORY LAYOUT HANDLING

By
default, svn&minus;buildpackage expects a
configuration file with path/url declaration,
.svn/deb&minus;layout. The values there can be overridden
with the &minus;&minus;svn&minus;override option, see
above. If a config file could not be found, the settings are
autodetected following the usual assumptions about local
directories and repository layout. In addition, the contents
of a custom file debian/svn&minus;deblayout will be imported
during the initial configuration. Package maintainers can
store this file in the repository to pass correct defaults
to new svn&minus;buildpackage users. The format is
the same as in the file .svn/deb&minus;layout. As an
alternative to the debian/svn&minus;deblayout file,
maintainers can set Subversion properties for the debian/
directory; any properties of debian/ which have a name of
the form svn&minus;bp:PROP will be the source of a
PROP setting which has the value indicated by the
first line of the property value. If a full svn URL is not
given, the repository root will be prepended to this
value.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

The
following environment variables are exported by
svn&minus;buildpackage and can be used in hook
commands or the package build system.

PACKAGE,
package

The
source package name.

SVN_BUILDPACKAGE

Version
of svn&minus;buildpackage.

TAG_VERSION,
debian_version

The
complete Debian version string, also used for the tag
copy.

non_epoch_version

Same as
debian_version but without any epoch
strings.

upstream_version

Same as
debian_version but without Debian extensions

guess_loc

Guessed
upstream source package name in the pool, something like
libm/libmeta&minus;html&minus;perl_3.2.1.0.orig.tar.gz

DIFFSRC

(experimental)
shows the location of generated diff file

All
the layout properties are exported to the environment, too.
The following ones have meaning to
svn&minus;buildpackage.

buildArea

the
location of build area directory

trunkUrl

the URL
of the trunk directory for the current package.

tagsUrl

the URL
of the tags base directory for the current
package.

origDir

the local
directory where the orig tarball should be
located.

origUrl

the URL
from where the orig tarball for the current package can be
pulled from.

The
following variables are understood by
svn&minus;buildpackage:

FORCETAG

Ignore
the signs of an incomplete changelog and tag the repository
anyway.

FORCEEXPORT

Export
upstream source from the repository even if
mergeWithUpstream property is set.

DEBIAN_FRONTEND

If
DEBIAN_FRONTEND is set to 'noninteractive'
&minus;&minus;svn&minus;noninteractive is called
silently.

RECOMMENDATIONS

Use
shell aliases. Here are some examples for Bash:

alias
svn&minus;b="svn&minus;buildpackage &minus;us &minus;uc
&minus;rfakeroot &minus;&minus;svn&minus;ignore" 
alias svn&minus;br="svn&minus;b
&minus;&minus;svn&minus;dont&minus;purge
&minus;&minus;svn&minus;reuse" 
alias svn&minus;bt="svn&minus;buildpackage
&minus;&minus;svn&minus;tag
&minus;rfakeroot"

Those
commands have respective meanings: build regardless of new
or changed files; build regardless of new or changed files
and reuse the build directory; build (for upload) and
tag.

SSH
is the easiest way to access remote repositories, although
it usually requires entering a password more frequently with
svn&minus;buildpackage. Workarounds include using an
ssh key without a passphrase (although this is insecure and
still relatively slow), or the SSH connection caching
feature present in recent versions of SSH. For details, see
the svn&minus;buildpackage manual.

Another
way to get a remote link is using the Subversion DAV module
(with SSL and Apache user authentication), see the
svn&minus;buildpackage HOWTO manual for
details.
