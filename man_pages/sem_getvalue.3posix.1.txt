SEM_GETVALUE(3POSIX)       POSIX Programmer's Manual      SEM_GETVALUE(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       sem_getvalue — get the value of a semaphore

SYNOPSIS
       #include <semaphore.h>

       int sem_getvalue(sem_t *restrict sem, int *restrict sval);

DESCRIPTION
       The sem_getvalue() function shall update the location referenced by the
       sval  argument  to  have  the  value of the semaphore referenced by sem
       without affecting the state of the semaphore. The updated value  repre‐
       sents  an actual semaphore value that occurred at some unspecified time
       during the call, but it need not be the actual value of  the  semaphore
       when it is returned to the calling process.

       If  sem is locked, then the object to which sval points shall either be
       set to zero or to a negative number whose absolute value represents the
       number  of processes waiting for the semaphore at some unspecified time
       during the call.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, the sem_getvalue() function shall return  a
       value  of  zero. Otherwise, it shall return a value of -1 and set errno
       to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The sem_getvalue() function may fail if:

       EINVAL The sem argument does not refer to a valid semaphore.
