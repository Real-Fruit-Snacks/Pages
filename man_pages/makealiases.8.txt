NEWALIASES(8) BSD System Manager’s Manual
NEWALIASES(8)

NAME

newaliases —
rebuild mail aliases

SYNOPSIS

newaliases
[-f file]

DESCRIPTION

The newaliases utility
makes changes to the mail aliases file visible to smtpd(8).
It should be run every time the aliases(5) file is changed.
The location of the alias file is defined in smtpd.conf(5),
and defaults to /etc/aliases.

The options are
as follows:

-f file

Use file as the
configuration file, instead of the default
/etc/smtpd.conf.

If using
database (db) files, newaliases is equivalent to
running makemap(8) as follows:

# makemap -t
aliases /etc/aliases

If using plain
text files, newaliases is equivalent to running
smtpctl(8) as follows:

# smtpctl
update table aliases

FILES 
/etc/aliases

List of local
user mail aliases.

/etc/virtual

List of virtual
host aliases.

EXIT STATUS

The newaliases utility
exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error
occurs.

HISTORY

The newaliases command
first appeared in OpenBSD 4.6 as a replacement for the
equivalent command shipped with sendmail.
