NAME

auedit -
graphically record and edit audio files

SYNOPSIS

auedit
[-audio servername] [-toolkitoption ...]
[filename]

DESCRIPTION

auedit
provides an X-based window-oriented interface allowing the
user to record and edit audio files. The editing features
available include:

o

Cutting, copying, pasting, and mixing within a single
auedit instance or between multiple auedit
instances. 

o

Changing the amplitude of an interval.

o

Reversing an interval.

o

Fading in or out an interval.

AUEDIT AND THE ATHENA WIDGET SET

auedit
uses the X Toolkit Intrinsics and the Athena Widget Set. For
more information, see the Athena Widget Set
documentation.

SCREEN LAYOUT

auedit
starts out with a single window divided into several
areas:

o

A collection of drop-down menus
and command buttons.

o

A volume indicator and control slider.

o

The audio file represented as a wave form. If the audio
data contains multiple tracks, the tracks will be displayed
in ascending order. For stereo data, the convention is left
track, then right track.

o

A set of indicators displaying the interval start,
duration, and end and the current position. These indicators
are in units of minutes, seconds, and hundredths of
seconds. 

o

Buttons to play, stop, and pause the audio.

o

Two menus indicating the current file and data
formats. 

o

Two editable fields containing the current frequency and
the audio file comment.

INTERVALS

Many functions
in auedit operate on a range of audio data called an
interval. The initial interval encompasses all of the
audio data. The interval is indicated within the wave form
by two solid, vertical lines. The left marker indicates the
start of the interval. The right marker indicates the end of
the interval. To select an interval of audio data, use the
mouse to move the interval markers in the wave form.
Pressing a mouse button in the wave form will select the
marker closest to the mouse position. That marker may then
be dragged to the desired location in the wave form. Note
that the markers may not cross over each other.

PLAYING AN INTERVAL

To play an
interval, click on the Play button (the one with the
triangle on its side). The audio data delimited by the start
and end markers will be played. A dashed vertical line will
indicate the approximate position of the data currently
being played. To stop playing, click on the Stop button (the
one containing a solid square). Clicking on Pause (the
button containing two vertical, parallel lines) will pause
the playing. To resume, click on Pause again. The volume
slider controls the play volume. The interval is played at
the frequency specified by the Frequency field. Note
that while data is being played, most other functions are
disabled.

THE FILE MENU

New...

Initializes auedit with
an empty file. You will be prompted for the number of tracks
for the new file.

Load...

Loads a file. You will be prompted for the file
name. 

Save

Saves the current file. A backup file will be created by
appending a tilde (~) to the current file name. The file
format, data format, frequency and comment are used when
saving the file.

Save as...

Saves the current file under a new name. You will be
prompted for the file name. The file format, data format,
frequency and comment are used when saving the file.

Save interval...

Saves the interval to a file. You will be prompted for a
file name. The file format, data format, frequency and
comment are used when saving the file.

Revert

Discards all changes made since the last save and
restores the data to its state following the last save.

Exit

Exits auedit. If there have been changes made to
the current file that have not been saved, you will be asked
if you wish to save them.

THE EDIT MENU

The cut, copy,
and paste commands in the edit menu transfer data to and
from a selection buffer. This buffer is shared between all
instances of auedit. This means that you can cut or
copy data from one instance of auedit and paste it
into another instance. The only restriction is that the
audio data in both instances must have the same number of
tracks. When transferring data between instances of
differing frequencies, the data will be converted to the
frequency of the destination. This can be used to change the
frequency of the data in a single instance of auedit.
First, cut the data whose frequency you wish to change. Then
change the Frequency field to the desired frequency.
Finally, paste the data back in. The frequency of the data
will be converted to the frequency specified in the
Frequency field.

Cut

Moves the interval to the
selection buffer.

Copy

Copies the interval to the selection buffer.

Paste insert

Inserts the selection buffer at the point marked by the
start marker.

Paste replace

Replaces the data at the point marked by the start
marker with the data from the selection buffer.

Paste mix

Mixes the data at the point marked by the start marker
with the data from the selection buffer. The mixing function
is an average.

Undo

Undoes the last operation that modified the audio data.
This includes effects operations in addition to editing
operations. If the last operation was an Undo then
the undo is undone, restoring the data to the state prior to
the first undo.

THE ZOOM MENU

In

Zoom in by a factor of two.

Out

Zoom out by a factor of two.

Markers

Zoom in to the interval delimited by the start and end
markers. 

Full

Zoom out to display all of the audio data.

THE EFFECTS MENU

All operations
under the effects menu apply to the current interval.

Amplitude...

Scale the amplitude. You will be
prompted for the scale. The scale may be non-integral.

Max Amplitude

Scales the interval to its maximum amplitude without
clipping. 

Reverse

Reverses the order of the data within the interval.

Fade In

Linearly scales the interval using a scale ranging from
0.0 to 1.0.

Fade Out

Linearly scales the interval using a scale ranging from
1.0 to 0.0.

THE RECORD COMMAND

Clicking on the
Record button brings up the record dialog box. The
record dialog box consists of:

o

A duration field. This is the
maximum duration of the recording in seconds.

o

A frequency field. This is the frequency of the
recording in hertz.

o

An input mode toggle button. Clicking this button
toggles between line mode and microphone mode.

o

A gain slider. This controls the input gain level.

o

A record toggle button. Clicking this button starts and
stops the recording.

o

A monitor toggle button. Clicking this button toggles
the record monitoring feature that lets you hear what
you&rsquo;re recording.

o

A dismiss command button. Clicking this button stops any
current recording and dismisses the record dialog box.
