REPORTBUG.CONF(5)             File Formats Manual            REPORTBUG.CONF(5)

NAME
       reportbug.conf - The configuration file for reportbug

SYNOPSIS
       /etc/reportbug.conf  -  The configuration file for reportbug, a program
       designed to report bugs in the Debian distribution

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page describes the layout of  the  reportbug  and  querybts
       configuration  file  and  the available configuration options.  The de‐
       fault location of the file is /etc/reportbug.conf and the  options  may
       be  overriding  in $HOME/.reportbugrc (which follows the same format as
       reportbug.conf).

       Please note that any configuration file has to be a valid  UTF-8  docu‐
       ment,  and not in a different locale; this is particularly important in
       situations where localized characters have to be used (like  for  real‐
       name).

FILE FORMAT
       Configuration options can be specified in the form

       option-name option-value

       True/False (boolean) options can be specified as

       boolean-option

       (if it's present, it's a True).

       Usually, no-option will disable option if option is boolean.

       Options can be specified in any order.

OPTIONS
       The summary of possible options (in alphabetical order) is as follows:

       bts    The  bug  tracking system to use, see reportbug --bts=help for a
              list of currently supported BTSes.

       cc (boolean)
              Whether the reporter should be Cc:ed on the bug report.

       check-available (boolean)
              Whether packages.debian.org should be queried for newer releases
              of  the  package.   In advanced and expert mode, http://ftp-mas‐
              ter.debian.org/new.html is also checked.

       compress (boolean)
              Whether modified configuration files included in the bug  report
              should be stripped down.

       config-files (boolean)
              Whether modified configuration files should be included with the
              bug report.

       draftpath
              The directory where unsubmitted reports should be saved. The de‐
              fault is /tmp.

       editor The editor to use to edit the bug report.  Example:

              editor "emacs -nw"

       email  Default From address of the bug email (override with environment
              variables, see reportbug(1)). Example:

              email "humberto@example.com"

       envelopefrom
              Specify the Envelope From mail header  (also  known  as  Return-
              path); by default it's the From address but it can be selected a
              different one in case the MTA doesn't canonicalize  local  users
              to  public addresses. This can be set to the empty string if the
              MTA does not allow setting the Envelope From.

       list-cc-me (boolean)
              Send a carbon copy of the report to your automatically  detected
              email  address  after  a  report  number  is  assigned, like the
              --list-cc-me option.

       mbox_reader_cmd
              Specify a command to open the bug reports mbox file. You can use
              %s  to  substitute  the mbox file to be used, and %% to insert a
              literal percent sign. If no %s is specified, the mbox file  name
              is supplied at the end of the argument list. Example:

              mbox_reader_cmd "mutt -f %s"

       header Additional headers to add to the bug email.  Like:

              header "X-Silly-Header: I haven't edited my /etc/reportbug.conf"
              header "X-Debbugs-No-Ack: please" # to suppress acknowledgments

              Note  that  setting  additional headers may not work reliably if
              the bug email is passed to an external MUA for submission.

       http_proxy
              Default HTTP proxy used to query the BTS (override with environ‐
              ment variables, see reportbug(1)). Example:

              http_proxy http://proxy.example.com:3128/

       justification
              The  justification  in  case of a Release Critical bug (severity
              either 'critical', 'serious' or 'grave'). Example:

              justification "text here"

       keyid  The GPG key to use, if different from the  default  one  on  the
              system.  Example:

              keyid 12345678

       maintonly
              See the --maintonly entry in reportbug(1).

       max_attachment_size
              The max size any attachment can have. Example:

              max_attachment_size 5000000

       mh     Use the mh mailer.

       mirror The address of a BTS mirror. Example:

              mirror http://mirror.address/

       mode [novice|standard|advanced|expert]
              The default operating mode for reportbug(1).

       mta    The  path  to the MTA used.  Any SMTP server on Debian should be
              OK with the default:

              mta /usr/sbin/sendmail

       mua    The mail user agent to use (the default is empty, to use an  in‐
              ternal mailer). Example:

              mua 'mutt -H'

       mutt   Use the mutt mailer.

       nmh    Use the nmh mailer.

       no-check-uid (boolean)

              is still checked).

       no-debconf (boolean)
              Disables adding the debconf-show output to the bug report.

       no-query-source (boolean)
              Disables querying the source packages for bugs.

       offline
              Disables all external queries.

       printonly
              Print the report on screen, don't sent it.

       query-bts (boolean)
              Whether the BTS should be queried for existing bug reports.

       quiet  See the --report-quiet entry in reportbug(1).

       realname
              The default real-name in the  From  address  of  the  bug  email
              (override  with  environment variables, see reportbug(1)). Exam‐
              ple:

              realname "Humberto Flores III"

       replyto

              the configuration file will disable prompting while running  re‐
              portbug.

       sign [gpg|pgp|gnupg|none]
              Program used to digitally sign bug reports automatically ('none'
              to disable it).

       smtphost
              Use an MTA different from  /usr/sbin/sendmail.   A  port  number
              other than 25 can also be specified. Example:

              smtphost mail.example.com:2525

              Use "smtphost localhost" to enable the internal MTA.

       smtppasswd

              case SSL/TLS will always be used.

       submit Use submit as the bug submission address.

       template

              sent to stdout.
