TXP(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual TXP(4)

NAME

txp &mdash; 3Com 3XP
Typhoon/Sidewinder (3CR990) Ethernet interface

SYNOPSIS

To compile this driver into the
kernel, place the following line in your kernel
configuration file:

device
txp

Alternatively,
to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following line in loader.conf(5):

if_txp_load="YES"

DEPRECATION NOTICE

The txp driver is not
present in FreeBSD 13.0 and later. See
https://github.com/freebsd/fcp/blob/master/fcp-0101.md for
more information.

DESCRIPTION

The txp interface
provides access to the 10Mb/s and 100Mb/s Ethernet networks
via the 3Com Typhoon/Sidewinder chipset.

Basic Ethernet
functions are provided as well as support for vlan(4) tag
removal and insertion assistance, receive ip(4), tcp(4), and
udp(4) checksum offloading, and transmit ip(4) checksum
offloading. There is currently no support for transmit
tcp(4) or udp(4) checksum offloading, tcp(4) segmentation,
nor ipsec(4) acceleration.

When a
txp interface is brought up, by default, it will
attempt to auto-negotiate the link speed and duplex mode.
The speeds, in order of attempt, are: 100Mb/s Full Duplex,
100Mb/s Half Duplex, 10 Mb/s Full Duplex, and 10 Mb/s Half
Duplex.

The txp
supports several media types, which are selected via the
ifconfig(8) command. The supported media types are:

media autoselect

Attempt to autoselect the media
type (default)

media 100baseTX mediaopt
full-duplex

Use 100baseTX, full duplex

media 100baseTX
[mediaopt half-duplex]

Use 100baseTX, half duplex

media 10baseT mediaopt
full-duplex

Use 10baseT, full duplex

media 10baseT
[mediaopt half-duplex]

Use 10baseT, half duplex
