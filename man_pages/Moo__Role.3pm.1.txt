NAME
       Moo::Role - Minimal Object Orientation support for Roles

SYNOPSIS
         package My::Role;

         use Moo::Role;
         use strictures 2;

         sub foo { ... }

         sub bar { ... }

         has baz => (
           is => 'ro',
         );

         1;

       And elsewhere:

         package Some::Class;

         use Moo;
         use strictures 2;

         # bar gets imported, but not foo
         with 'My::Role';

         sub foo { ... }

         1;

DESCRIPTION
       "Moo::Role" builds upon Role::Tiny, so look there for most of the
       documentation on how this works (in particular, using "Moo::Role" also
       enables strict and warnings).  The main addition here is extra bits to
       make the roles more "Moosey;" which is to say, it adds "has".

IMPORTED SUBROUTINES
       See "IMPORTED SUBROUTINES" in Role::Tiny for all the other subroutines
       that are imported by this module.

   has
         has attr => (
           is => 'ro',
         );

       Declares an attribute for the class to be composed into.  See "has" in
       Moo for all options.

CLEANING UP IMPORTS
       Moo::Role cleans up its own imported methods and any imports declared
       before the "use Moo::Role" statement automatically.  Anything imported
       after "use Moo::Role" will be composed into consuming packages.  A
       package that consumes this role:

         package My::Role::ID;

         use Digest::MD5 qw(md5_hex);
         use Moo::Role;
         use Digest::SHA qw(sha1_hex);

         requires 'name';

         sub as_md5  { my ($self) = @_; return md5_hex($self->name);  }
         sub as_sha1 { my ($self) = @_; return sha1_hex($self->name); }

         1;

       ..will now have a "$self->sha1_hex()" method available to it that
       probably does not do what you expect.  On the other hand, a call to
       "$self->md5_hex()" will die with the helpful error message: "Can't
       locate object method "md5_hex"".

       See "CLEANING UP IMPORTS" in Moo for more details.
