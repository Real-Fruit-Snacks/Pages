WCSCAT(3POSIX)             POSIX Programmer's Manual            WCSCAT(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       wcscat — concatenate two wide-character strings

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       wchar_t *wcscat(wchar_t *restrict ws1, const wchar_t *restrict ws2);

DESCRIPTION
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with  the
       ISO C  standard.  Any  conflict between the requirements described here
       and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017
       defers to the ISO C standard.

       The  wcscat() function shall append a copy of the wide-character string
       pointed to by ws2 (including the terminating null wide-character  code)
       to the end of the wide-character string pointed to by ws1.  The initial
       wide-character code of ws2 shall overwrite the null wide-character code
       at  the  end of ws1.  If copying takes place between objects that over‐
       lap, the behavior is undefined.

RETURN VALUE
       The wcscat() function shall return ws1; no return value is reserved  to
       indicate an error.

ERRORS
       No errors are defined.
