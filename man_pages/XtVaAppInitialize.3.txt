NAME
       XtAppInitialize, XtVaAppInitialize - initialize, open, or close a dis‐
       play

SYNTAX
       #include <X11/Intrinsic.h>

       Widget XtAppInitialize(XtAppContext* app_context_return, const char
              *application_class, XrmOptionDescRec* options, Cardinal num_op‐
              tions, int *argc_in_out, char **argv_in_out, String *fall‐
              back_resources, ArgList args, Cardinal num_args);

       Widget XtVaAppInitialize(XtAppContext* app_context_return, const char
              *application_class, XrmOptionDescRec* options, Cardinal num_op‐
              tions, int *argc_in_out, char **argv_in_out, String *fall‐
              back_resources, ...);

ARGUMENTS
       app_context_return
                 Specifies the application context.

       application_class
                 Specifies the class name of this application, which usually
                 is the generic name for all instances of this application.

       options   Specifies how to parse the command line for any application-
                 specific resources.  The options argument is passed as a pa‐
                 rameter to XrmParseCommand.  For further information, see
                 Xlib - C Language X Interface.

       num_options
                 Specifies the number of entries in the options list.

       argc_in_out
                 Specifies a pointer to the number of command line parameters.

       argv_in_out
                 Specifies the command line parameters.

       fallback_resources
                 Specifies resource values to be used if the application class
                 resource file cannot be opened or read, or NULL.

       args      Specifies the argument list to override any other resource
                 specification for the created shell widget.

       num_args  Specifies the number of entries in the argument list.

       ...       Specifies the variable argument list to override any other
                 resource specification for the created shell widget.

DESCRIPTION
       The XtAppInitialize function calls XtToolkitInitialize followed by
       XtCreateApplicationContext, then calls XtOpenDisplay with dis‐
       play_string NULL and application_name NULL, and finally calls XtAppCre‐
       ateShell with application_name NULL, widget_class applicationShellWid‐
       getClass, and the specified args and num_args and returns the created
       shell.  The modified argc and argv returned by XtDisplayInitialize are
       returned in argc_in_out and argv_in_out. If app_context_return is not
       NULL, the created application context is also returned.  If the display
       specified by the command line cannot be opened, an error message is is‐
       sued and XtAppInitialize terminates the application.  If fallback_re‐
       sources is non-NULL, XtAppSetFallbackResources is called with the value
       prior to calling XtOpenDisplay.

       XtAppInitialize and XtVaAppInitialize have been superceded by XtOpenAp‐
       plication and XtVaOpenApplication respectively.
