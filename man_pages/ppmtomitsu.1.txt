DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

ppmtomitsu
reads a PPM image as input and converts it into a format
suitable to be printed by a Mitsubishi S340-10 printer, or
any other Mitsubishi color sublimation printer.

The Mitsubishi
S340-10 Color Sublimation printer can print in 24 bit color.
Images of the available sizes take so long to transfer that
there is a fast method, employing a lookup table, that
ppmtomitsu uses if there are no more than 256 colors
in the image. ppmtomitsu tries to position your image
at the center of the paper, and will rotate your image for
you if xsize is larger than ysize. If your
image is larger than the media allows, ppmtomitsu
fails. (We decided that the media were too expensive to have
careless users produce misprints). Once data transmission
has started, the job can’t be stopped in a sane way
without resetting the printer. The printer understands
putting together images in the printer’s memory;
ppmtomitsu doesn’t use this function because
pamcat etc provide the same functions and let you
view the result on-screen, too. The S340-10 is the lowest
common denominator printer; for higher resolution printers
there is the dpi300 option. The other printers are also
capable of higher values for enlarge, etc., but I
don’t think that is valuable enough to warrant a
change in the program.

For proper
results, the input maxval must be 255. Use pamdepth
to ensure that it is.

Before Netpbm
10.40 (September 2007), all Netpbm PPM programs, including
ppmtomitsu, see a PBM image as having maxval 1, so
ppmtomitsu does not function properly with PBM input.
You can use ppmtoppm together with pamdepth to
turn your PBM input into maxval 255 PPM input that
ppmtomitsu will use properly.

OPTIONS

In addition to
the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most
notably -quiet, see
 Common Options ),
ppmtomitsu recognizes the following command line
options: 
-sharpness 1-4

"sharpness"
designation. Default is to use the current sharpness.

-enlarge 1-3

Enlarge by a factor; Default is
1 (no enlarge)

-media
{A|A4|AS|A4S}

Designate the media
you’re using. Default is 1184 x 1350, which will fit
on any media. A is 1216 x 1350, A4 is 1184 x 1452, AS is
1216 x 1650 and A4S is 1184 x 1754. A warning: If you
specify a different media than the printer currently has,
the printer will wait until you put in the correct media or
switch it off.

-copy 1-9

The number of copies to
produce. Default is 1.

-dpi300

Double the number of allowed
pixels for a S3600-30 Printer in S340-10 compatibility mode.
(The S3600-30 has 300 dpi).

-tiny

Memory-saving, but always slow. The printer will get the
data line-by-line in 24bit. It’s probably a good idea
to use this if your machine starts paging a lot without this
option.
