MEMSET(3POSIX)             POSIX Programmer's Manual            MEMSET(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       memset — set bytes in memory

SYNOPSIS
       #include <string.h>

       void *memset(void *s, int c, size_t n);

DESCRIPTION
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with  the
       ISO C  standard.  Any  conflict between the requirements described here
       and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017
       defers to the ISO C standard.

       The memset() function shall copy c (converted to an unsigned char) into
       each of the first n bytes of the object pointed to by s.

RETURN VALUE
       The memset() function shall return s; no return value  is  reserved  to
       indicate an error.

ERRORS
       No errors are defined.
