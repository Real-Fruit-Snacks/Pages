BWI(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual BWI(4)

NAME

bwi &mdash; Broadcom
BCM43xx IEEE 802.11b/g wireless network driver

SYNOPSIS

To compile this driver into the
kernel, place the following lines in your kernel
configuration file:

device bwi

device wlan 
device wlan_amrr 
device firmware

Alternatively,
to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following line in loader.conf(5):

if_bwi_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION

The bwi driver provides
support for Broadcom BCM43xx based PCI/CardBus network
adapters.

It supports
station and monitor mode operation. Only one
virtual interface may be configured at any time. For more
information on configuring this device, see ifconfig(8).

This driver
requires firmware to be loaded before it will work. The
ports/net/bwi-firmware-kmod port needs to be
installed before ifconfig(8) will work.

HARDWARE

The bwi driver supports
Broadcom BCM43xx based wireless devices, including:

Card Chip

Dell Truemobile 1400 BCM4309 Mini PCI b/g 
HP nx6125 BCM4319 PCI b/g 
Linksys WPC54G Ver 3 BCM4318 CardBus b/g 
Linksys WPC54GS Ver 2 BCM4318 CardBus b/g

US Robotics 5411 BCM4318 CardBus b/g

The bwi
driver uses the older v3 version of Broadcom&rsquo;s
firmware. While this older firmware does support most
BCM43xx parts, the bwn(4) driver works better for the newer
chips it supports. You must use the bwi driver if you
are using older Broadcom chipsets (BCM4301, BCM4303 and
BCM4306 rev 2). The v4 version of the firmware that bwn(4)
uses does not support these chips.

EXAMPLES

Join an existing BSS network
(i.e., connect to an access point):

ifconfig wlan
create wlandev bwi0 inet 192.168.0.20 \ 
netmask 0xffffff00

Join a specific
BSS network with network name
&rsquo;&rsquo;my_net&rsquo;&rsquo;:

ifconfig wlan
create wlandev bwi0 ssid my_net up

Join a specific
BSS network with 64-bit WEP encryption:

ifconfig wlan
create wlandev bwi0 ssid my_net \ 
wepmode on wepkey 0x1234567890 weptxkey 1 up

HISTORY

The bwi driver first
appeared in FreeBSD 8.0.

AUTHORS

The bwi driver was
written for DragonFly BSD by Sepherosa Ziehau and
subsequently ported to FreeBSD.

BUGS

Some card based on the BCM4306
and BCM4309 chips do not work properly on channel 1, 2 and
3.
