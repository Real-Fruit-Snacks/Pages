getfilecon(3)              SELinux API documentation             getfilecon(3)

NAME
       getfilecon,  fgetfilecon, lgetfilecon - get SELinux security context of
       a file

SYNOPSIS
       #include <selinux/selinux.h>

       int getfilecon(const char *path, char **con);

       int getfilecon_raw(const char *path, char **con);

       int lgetfilecon(const char *path, char **con);

       int lgetfilecon_raw(const char *path, char **con);

       int fgetfilecon(int fd, char **con);

       int fgetfilecon_raw(int fd, char **con);

DESCRIPTION
       getfilecon() retrieves the context associated with the  given  path  in
       the file system, the length of the context is returned.

       lgetfilecon()  is  identical  to  getfilecon(), except in the case of a
       symbolic link, where the link itself is interrogated, not the file that
       it refers to.

       fgetfilecon()  is identical to getfilecon(), only the open file pointed
       to by filedes (as returned by open(2))  is  interrogated  in  place  of
       path.  Since libselinux 3.4 a file opened via O_PATH is supported.

       getfilecon_raw(),  lgetfilecon_raw() and fgetfilecon_raw() behave iden‐
       tically to their non-raw counterparts but do not perform context trans‐
       lation.

       The returned context should be freed with freecon(3) if non-NULL.

RETURN VALUE
       On  success,  a  positive number is returned indicating the size of the
       extended attribute value. On failure, -1 is returned and errno is   set
       appropriately.

       If the context does not exist, or the process has no access to this at‐
       tribute, errno is set to ENODATA.

       If extended attributes are not supported by the filesystem, or are dis‐
       abled, errno is set to ENOTSUP.

       The  errors  documented for the stat(2) system call are also applicable
       here.
