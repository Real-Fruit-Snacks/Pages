NAME

aha — Adaptec SCSI
host adapter driver

SYNOPSIS

To compile this driver into the
kernel, place the following lines in your kernel
configuration file:

device scbus

device aha

Alternatively,
to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following line in loader.conf(5):

aha_load="YES"

In
/boot/device.hints:

hint.aha.0.at="isa"

DESCRIPTION

This driver provides access to
the SCSI bus connected to the Adaptec AHA-154x SCSI host
adapters. x is 0 for controllers without a floppy drive and
2 for controllers that have them.

One device hint
entry for every card to be attached by the system is
required. Specific values for the port address, IRQ, and DRQ
may be specified. If wildcard values are used, the driver
will query the device for its current settings and use
those. If the port address is a wildcard, the driver
consults an internal table of possible port address
locations and attaches to the first unattached card it
finds. The possible port addresses for this card are 0x330,
0x334, 0x230, 0x234, 0x130, and 0x134.

HARDWARE

The aha driver supports
the following SCSI host adapters:

•

Adaptec AHA-154xB

•

Adaptec AHA-154xC

•

Adaptec AHA-154xCF

AUTHORS

The aha driver was ported
by M. Warner Losh from the bt driver written by
Justin T. Gibbs.

BUGS

The AHA-154xA card does not
support residuals on data transfers. As a result, this card
is no longer supported.

There have been
some reports that the AHA-154xB does not work well under
heavy load.

The AHA-154xCP
is a plug and play controller. However, its resources are
set using the on-board BIOS and cannot be moved. Failures to
attached for this card are often caused when the resources
set in the BIOS conflict.
