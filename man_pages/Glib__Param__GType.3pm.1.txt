NAME
       Glib::Param::GType - Wrapper for type parameters in GLib

HIERARCHY
         Glib::ParamSpec
         +----Glib::Param::GType

DESCRIPTION
       This object describes a parameter which holds the name of a class known
       to the GLib type system.  The name of the class is considered to be the
       common ancestor for valid values.  To create a param that allows any
       type name, specify "undef" for the package name.  Beware, however, that
       although we say "any type name", this actually refers to any type
       registered with Glib; normal Perl packages will not work.

METHODS
   string or undef = $pspec_gtype->get_is_a_type
       If "undef", then any class is allowed.

       Since: glib 2.10
