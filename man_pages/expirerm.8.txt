NAME

expirerm -
Remove articles that have been expired

SYNOPSIS

expirerm
file

DESCRIPTION

expirerm
is a script that removes a list of files. The specified
file lists the files to be removed. It is usually
created by expire -z. This file is sorted, and then
fed into a pipeline responsible for doing the removal,
normally fastrm. (You may want to edit
expirerm to change the flags passed to
fastrm.)

If there seemed
to be a problem removing the files, then a mail is sent to
the news administrator. If there were no problems, then
file is renamed to pathlog/expire.list where
it is kept (for safety) until the next time expiration is
done.
