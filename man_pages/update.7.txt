NAME

UPDATE &minus;
update rows of a table

SYNOPSIS

UPDATE [ ONLY ]
table SET column = { expression |
DEFAULT } [, ...] 
[ FROM fromlist ] 
[ WHERE condition ]

DESCRIPTION

UPDATE
changes the values of the specified columns in all rows that
satisfy the condition. Only the columns to be modified need
be mentioned in the statement; columns not explicitly SET
retain their previous values.

By default,
UPDATE will update rows in the specified table and
all its subtables. If you wish to only update the specific
table mentioned, you must use the ONLY clause.

You must have
the UPDATE privilege on the table to update it, as well as
the SELECT privilege to any table whose values are read in
the expressions or condition.

PARAMETERS

table

The name (optionally
schema-qualified) of the table to update.

column

The name of a column in table.

expression

An expression to assign to the
column. The expression may use the old values of this and
other columns in the table.

DEFAULT

Set the column to its default
value (which will be NULL if no specific default expression
has been assigned to it).

fromlist

A list of table expressions,
allowing columns from other tables to appear in the WHERE
condition and the update expressions.

condition

An expression that returns a
value of type boolean. Only rows for which this
expression returns true will be updated.

OUTPUTS

On successful
completion, an UPDATE command returns a command tag
of the form

UPDATE
count

The
count is the number of rows updated. If count
is 0, no rows matched the condition (this is not
considered an error).

EXAMPLES

Change the word
Drama to Dramatic in the column kind of the table
films:

UPDATE films
SET kind = &rsquo;Dramatic&rsquo; WHERE kind =
&rsquo;Drama&rsquo;;

Adjust
temperature entries and reset precipitation to its default
value in one row of the table weather:

UPDATE weather
SET temp_lo = temp_lo+1, temp_hi = temp_lo+15, prcp =
DEFAULT 
WHERE city = &rsquo;San Francisco&rsquo; AND date =
&rsquo;2003-07-03&rsquo;;

COMPATIBILITY

This command
conforms to the SQL standard. The FROM clause is a
PostgreSQL extension.
