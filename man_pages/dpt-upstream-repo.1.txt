NAME

dpt-upstream-repo
- add upstream Git repository as git remote
upstream-repo

SYNOPSIS

dpt
upstream-repo [-g|-u]

DESCRIPTION

dpt
upstream-repo adds the upstream Git repository as a
git remote named upstream-repo. The
URL for the repository is read from either
debian/copyright&rsquo;s Source field or from
debian/upstream/metadata&rsquo;s Repository
field.

In case
there&rsquo;s no Git URL in
debian/copyright and debian/upstream/metadata
doesn&rsquo;t exist, the latter is created with
dpt-debian-upstream(1).

OPTIONS

-g

Don&rsquo;t create
debian/upstream/metadata. 

Used for
initial cloning, e.g. with mr up: We want the
upstream repo being added if debian/upstream/metadata
exists.

The letter
g is used for historical reasons because initially
this option only suppressed the automatic committing to the
git repository.

-u

Update the URL of
the upstream-repo git remote. The value is
read from the same places as for the initial creation.

-u
implies -g, i.e. we also don&rsquo;t create
debian/upstream/metadata on updates.
