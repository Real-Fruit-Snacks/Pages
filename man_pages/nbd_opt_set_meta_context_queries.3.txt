NAME

nbd_opt_set_meta_context_queries
- select specific meta contexts, using explicit query
list

SYNOPSIS

#include

typedef struct { 
int (*callback) (void *user_data, const char *name); 
void *user_data; 
void (*free) (void *user_data); 
} nbd_context_callback; 
int nbd_opt_set_meta_context_queries ( 
struct nbd_handle *h, char **queries, 
nbd_context_callback context_callback 
);

DESCRIPTION

Request that
the server supply all recognized meta contexts passed in
through "queries", in conjunction with the export
previously specified by the most recent
nbd_set_export_name(3) or nbd_connect_uri(3).
This can only be used if nbd_set_opt_mode(3) enabled
option mode. Normally, this function is redundant, as
nbd_opt_go(3) automatically does the same task if
structured replies or extended headers have already been
negotiated. But manual control over meta context requests
can be useful for fine-grained testing of how a server
handles unusual negotiation sequences. Often, use of this
function is coupled with
nbd_set_request_meta_context(3) to bypass the
automatic context request normally performed by
nbd_opt_go(3).

The NBD
protocol allows a client to decide how many queries to ask
the server. This function takes an explicit list of queries;
to instead reuse an implicit list, see
nbd_opt_set_meta_context(3). Since this function is
primarily designed for testing servers, libnbd does not
prevent the use of this function on an empty list or when
nbd_set_request_structured_replies(3) has disabled
structured replies, in order to see how a server
behaves.

The
"context" function is called once per server
reply, with any "user_data" passed to this
function, and with "name" supplied by the server.
Additionally, each server name will remain visible through
nbd_can_meta_context(3) until the next attempt at
nbd_set_export_name(3) or
nbd_opt_set_meta_context(3), as well as
nbd_opt_go(3) or nbd_opt_info(3) that trigger
an automatic meta context request. Remember that it is not
safe to call any "nbd_*" APIs from within the
context of the callback function. At present, the return
value of the callback is ignored, although a return of -1
should be avoided.

For
convenience, when this function succeeds, it returns the
number of replies returned by the server.

Not all servers
understand this request, and even when it is understood, the
server might intentionally send an empty list because it
does not support the requested context, or may encounter a
failure after delivering partial results. Thus, this
function may succeed even when no contexts are reported, or
may fail but have a non-empty list.

RETURN VALUE

This call
returns an integer &ge; 0.

ERRORS

On error -1 is
returned.

Refer to
"ERROR HANDLING" in libnbd(3) for how to
get further details of the error.

The following
parameters must not be NULL: "h",
"queries". For more information see "Non-NULL
parameters" in libnbd(3).
