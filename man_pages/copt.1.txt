DESCRIPTION

copt is a
general-purpose peephole optimizer. It reads code from its
standard input and writes an improved version to its
standard output. copy reads the named files for its
optimizations, which are encoded as follows:

... 

= 

... 

Pattern
matching uses literal string comparison, with one exception:
&rsquo;&rsquo;%%&rsquo;&rsquo; matches the
&rsquo;&rsquo;%&rsquo;&rsquo; character, and
&rsquo;&rsquo;%&rsquo;&rsquo; followed by a digit matches
everything up to the next occurrence of the next pattern
character, though all occurrences of %n must denote
the same string. For example, the pattern
&rsquo;&rsquo;%1=%1.&rsquo;&rsquo; matches exactly those
strings that begin with a string X, followed by a
&rsquo;&rsquo;=&rsquo;&rsquo; (the first), followed by a
second occurrence of X, followed by a period. In this way,
the input/output pattern

mov $%1,r%2

mov *r%2,r%2 
= 
mov %1,r%2

commands copt
to replace runs like

mov $_a,r3 
mov *r3,r3

with

mov _a,r3

Note that a tab
or newline can terminate a %n variable.

copt compares
each run of input patterns with the current input
instruction and its predecessors. If no match is found, it
advances to the next input instruction and tries again.
Otherwise, it replaces the input instructions with the
corresponding output patterns, pattern variables
instantiated,and resumes its search with the first
instruction of the replacement. copt matches input patterns
in reverse order to cascade optimizations without backing
up.

BUGS

Errors in
optimization files are always possible.
