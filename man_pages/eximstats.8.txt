-qlist

List of times for queuing
information single 0 item suppresses.

-tnumber

Display top 
sources/destinations default is 50, 0 suppresses top
listing.

-tnl

Omit local sources/destinations
in top listing.

-t_remote_users

Include remote users in the top
source/destination listings.

-include_original_destination

Include the original
destination email addresses rather than just using the final
ones. Useful for finding out which of your mailing lists are
receiving mail.

-show_dtlist

Show the delivery times
(DT)for all the messages.

Exim must have
been configured to use the +deliver_time logging option for
this option to work.

list is
an optional list of times. Eg -show_dt1,2,4,8 will show the
number of messages with delivery times under 1 second, 2
seconds, 4 seconds, 8 seconds, and over 8 seconds.

-show_rtlist

Show the receipt times for all
the messages. The receipt time is defined as the Completed
hh:mm:ss - queue_time_overall - the Receipt hh:mm:ss. These
figures will be skewed by pipelined messages so might not be
that useful.

Exim must have
been configured to use the +queue_time_overall logging
option for this option to work.

list is
an optional list of times. Eg -show_rt1,2,4,8 will show the
number of messages with receipt times under 1 second, 2
seconds, 4 seconds, 8 seconds, and over 8 seconds.

-byhost

Show results by sending host.
This may be combined with -bydomain and/or
-byemail and/or -byedomain. If none of these
options are specified, then -byhost is assumed as a
default.

-bydomain

Show results by sending domain.
May be combined with -byhost and/or -byemail
and/or -byedomain.

-byemail

Show results by sender’s
email address. May be combined with -byhost and/or
-bydomain and/or -byedomain.

-byemaildomain or
-byedomain

Show results by sender’s
email domain. May be combined with -byhost and/or
-bydomain and/or -byemail.

-pattern Description
/Pattern/

Look for the specified pattern
and count the number of lines in which it appears. This
option can be specified multiple times. Eg:

-pattern
'Refused connections' '/refused connection/'

-merge

This option allows eximstats to
merge old eximstat reports together. Eg:

eximstats
mainlog.sun > report.sun.txt 
eximstats mainlog.mon > report.mon.txt 
eximstats mainlog.tue > report.tue.txt 
eximstats mainlog.wed > report.web.txt 
eximstats mainlog.thu > report.thu.txt 
eximstats mainlog.fri > report.fri.txt 
eximstats mainlog.sat > report.sat.txt 
eximstats -merge report.*.txt > weekly_report.txt 
eximstats -merge -html report.*.txt >
weekly_report.html

•

You can merge text or html reports and output the
results as text or html.

•

You can use all the normal eximstat output options, but
only data included in the original reports can be shown!

•

When merging reports, some loss of accuracy may occur in
the top n lists. This will be towards the ends of the
lists. 

•

The order of items in the top n lists may vary
when the data volumes round to the same value.

-charts

Create graphical charts to be
displayed in HTML output. Only valid in combination with
-html.

This requires
the following modules which can be obtained from
http://www.cpan.org/modules/01modules.index.html

GD

GDTextUtil 
GDGraph

To install
these, download and unpack them, then use the normal perl
installation procedure:

perl
Makefile.PL 
make 
make test 
make install

On Debian
GNU/Linux you can use "apt-get install libgd-perl
libgd-text-perl libgd-graph-perl" instead.

-chartdirI

Create the charts in the
directory 

-chartrelI

Specify the relative directory
for the "img src=" tags from where to include the
charts

-emptyok

Specify that it’s OK to
not find any valid log lines. Without this we will output an
error message if we don’t find any.

-d

Debug flag. This outputs the eval()’d
parser onto STDOUT which makes it easier to trap errors in
the eval section. Remember to add 1 to the line numbers to
allow for the title!

DESCRIPTION

Eximstats
parses exim mainlog and syslog files to output a statistical
analysis of the messages processed. By default, a text
analysis is generated, but you can request other output
formats using flags. See the help (-help) to learn
about how to create charts from the tables.

TO DO

This program
does not perfectly handle messages whose received and
delivered log lines are in different files, which can happen
when you have multiple mail servers and a message cannot be
immediately delivered. Fixing this could be tricky...

Merging of xls
files is not (yet) possible. Be free to implement :)
