I4BISPPP(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual I4BISPPP(4)

NAME

i4bisppp &mdash; isdn4bsd
synchronous PPP over ISDN B-channel network driver

SYNOPSIS

device
"i4bisppp" [count] 
device sppp

DESCRIPTION

The i4bisppp driver
interfaces the IP subsystem of the operating system with the
isdn4bsd package so that a transport of IP packets over an
ISDN link is possible.

The driver is
just a glue layer between the sppp(4) backend and the
ISDN4BSD package and needs the sppp(4) driver configured
into the kernel.

The network
interfaces provided by this driver are named
isp, where  is a number between 0
and count-1 from the kernel config line.

For
configuration of the i4bsppp driver, either the
spppcontrol(8) utility is used or the driver can be
configured via isdnd(8) and its associated isdnd.rc(5)
file.

In case an IP
packet for a remote side arrives in the driver and no
connection is established yet, the driver communicates with
the isdnd(8) daemon to establish a connection.

The driver has
support for interfacing to the bpf(4) subsystem for using
tcpdump(1) with the isp interfaces.

LINK0 and LINK1

The link0 and
link1 flags given as parameters to ifconfig(8) have
the following meaning for the isp
devices:

link0

wait passively
for connection

link1

auto-dial on
output

The link0
and link1 flags are set to off by default.

See sppp(4) for
a more detailed discussion of the flags.
