       -l,--list-entries
           List password entries. These are the folder names displayed in the
           KDE Wallet Manager utility. If the -f option is given, this will
           only display the subfolders of the specified folder.

       -r,--read-password Entry
           Read the contents of the given Entry from the Foldersection of the
