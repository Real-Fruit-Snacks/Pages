ldbash
[−U | −-unload lib,[lib] ...]

ldbash
[−e | −-externlist lib,[lib] ...]

ldbash [−-externlist-all] 
ldbash
[−-i | −-internlista lib,[lib] ...]

DESCRIPTION

ldbash is used to
manipulate libbash(7) libraries. Its main function is to
load specific library. It can also print list of available
libraries, list functions each library exports, unload
functions, etc.

In case of
−-load and −-unload ,the output is
intended to be passed to bash eval command.

Options 
−h | −-help

Print options
summary

−l |
−-list

Display list of
available libraries. The libraries names listed, may be
passed as parameters to other invocations of ldbash.
I.e. first you run ldbash −-list to see what is
available and then you may load it.

−L |
−-load lib,[lib] ...

Load given libraries - i.e.
print string that should be passed to eval command.
Usually the string contains various source
commands.

Libraries that
given libraries depend on are also loaded.

Libraries only
loaded if their dependencies are satisfied. Dependencies are
resolved using ldbash.cache file, which is created by
ldbashconfig(8).

−U |
−-unload lib,[lib] ...

Unload given libraries, but
not their dependencies.

The output
should be passed to eval command (in the same manner
as with −-load ).

−e |
−-externlist lib,[lib] ...

List all symbols that are
exported by given libraries. Symbols are usually functions
that given libraries implement.

−-externlist-all

List all exported symbols of
all available libraries. Symbols are usually functions that
library implement.

−i |
−-internlist lib,[lib] ...

List all internal symbols (i.e.
global variables/functions) of given libraries. This is
intended mostly for developers that want to develop library
of their own, and want to be sure that they don’t
override any already defined symbol.

−-internlist-all

List all internal symbols of
all available libraries. This is intended mostly for
developers that want to develop library of their own, and
want to be sure that they don’t override any already
defined symbol.

FILES 
/etc/ldbash.cache

Cache file that contains
information about libraries dependencies and list of
exported symbols. See ldbashconfig((8)) for further
details.

BUGS

The script can’t load
libraries if their file name starts with ’-’.
(If someone uses file names that start with a
’-’ he/she deserves it!)
