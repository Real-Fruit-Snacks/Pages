NAME

thinkjettopbm -
convert HP ThinkJet printer commands file to PBM

SYNOPSIS

thinkjettopbm

[-d]

[thinkjet_file]

DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

thinkjettopbm
reads HP ThinkJet printer commands from the standard input,
or thinkjet_file if specified, and writes a PBM image
to Standard Output.

thinkjettopbm
silently ignores text and non-graphics command
sequences.

OPTIONS

In addition to
the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most
notably -quiet, see
 Common Options ),
thinkjettopbm recognizes the following command line
option:

-d

Turns on debugging messages which are written to the
standard error stream.

LIMITATIONS

The program
handles only a small subset of ThinkJet command sequences,
but enough to convert screen images from older HP test
equipment.
