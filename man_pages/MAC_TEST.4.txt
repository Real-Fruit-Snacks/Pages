to the debugger. Additionally, a set of statistics regarding
the number of times various MAC framework entry points have
been called is stored in the security.mac.test
sysctl(8) tree.

BUGS

While the MAC Framework design
is intended to support the containment of the root user, not
all attack channels are currently protected by entry point
checks. As such, MAC Framework policies should not be relied
on, in isolation, to protect against a malicious privileged
user.
