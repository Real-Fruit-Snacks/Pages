NAME

quorum_dispatch
- Dispatches callbacks from the quorum service

SYNOPSIS

#include

int
quorum_dispatch(quorum_handle_t handle,
cs_dispatch_flags_t *dispatch_types);

DESCRIPTION

The
quorum_dispatch function is used to dispatch
configuration changes.

Each
application may have several connections to the quorum API.
Each application uses the handle argument to uniquely
identify the connection.

The
dispatch_types argument is used to identify the type
of dispatch to execute. The possible types are defined by
the structure:

typedef enum {

CS_DISPATCH_ONE = 1, 
CS_DISPATCH_ALL = 2, 
CS_DISPATCH_BLOCKING = 3, 
CS_DISPATCH_ONE_NONBLOCKING = 4 
} cs_dispatch_flags_t;

The dispatch
values have the following meanings: 
CS_DISPATCH_ONE

Dispatch at least one callback,
blocking until the callback is dispatched.

CS_DISPATCH_ALL

Dispatch all waiting callbacks
without blocking to wait for any callbacks.

CS_DISPATCH_BLOCKING

Dispatch all callbacks blocking
indefinitely. This is used in a threaded program where a
thread is created, and then quorum_dispatch() is called
immediately from the created thread to execute
callbacks.

CS_DISPATCH_ONE_NONBLOCKING

Dispatch at most one callback.
If there is no pending callback, CS_ERR_TRY_AGAIN is
returned.

RETURN VALUE

This call
returns the CS_OK value if successful, otherwise an error is
returned.

ERRORS

CS_ERR_TRY_AGAIN
Resource temporarily unavailable

CS_ERR_INVALID_PARAM
Invalid argument

CS_ERR_ACCESS
Permission denied

CS_ERR_LIBRARY
The connection failed

CS_ERR_INTERRUPT
System call interrupted by a signal

CS_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED
The requested protocol/functionality not supported

CS_ERR_MESSAGE_ERROR
Incorrect auth message received

CS_ERR_NO_MEMORY
Not enough memory to complete the requested task
