NAME

cvs−buildpackage
− build Debian packages from a CVS repository.

SYNOPSIS

cvs−buildpackage
[options]

DESCRIPTION

This manual
page explains the Debian cvs−buildpackage
utility, which is used to build Debian packages whose
sources are stored in a CVS repository. This is a
CVS -aware wrapper around dpkg-buildpackage, and it
first parses ./debian/changelog; exports the
corresponding version (tagged
debian_version_ ), and runs
dpkg-buildpackage in the exported tree. It looks for
uncommitted files in the source tree, and offers to abort
before doing anything so that the user may commit the files
in, if they wish. cvs−buildpackage can also
optionally automatically re−tag all files before
exporting the source (this functionality is only relevant in
the top level directory of a checked out Debian package
source tree, of course).

Please note
that the work directory referred to below is the
scratch directory where the program does its work; it is
where it shall export the sources from CVS, and it assumes
full control of that directory Read: anything in that
directory, apart from the orig source files, can be deleted
by cvs-buildpackage Make sure not to have your
checked out sources/working directory in the same location,
as you may lose data.

If this utility
is not run from a top level directory of a checked out
Debian package source tree, then to build an old version the
cvs module name or the package name have to be supplied on
the command line.

Combined with
the companion utilities cvs−inject and
cvs−upgrade, this provides an infrastructure to
facilitate the use of CVS by Debian maintainers. This
allows one to keep separate CVS branches of a package for
stable, unstable, and possibly experimental
distributions, along with the other benefits of a version
control system.

OPTIONS

−h
Print out a usage message. 
−M

The name of the CVS module.

−P

Sets the name of the package.
Very useful if this is not running in the CVS checked out
source tree, in which case one also needs the version of the
package, which may optionally be determined by checking out
the latest debian/changelog file.

−V

The version number of the
package. In conjunction with setting the package name, this
option allows operation outside a CVS source tree (just
needs the repository).

−T

The CVS tag to use for
exporting sources, rather than constructing one from the
version. This assumes you know what you are doing.

−U

The CVS tag to use for the
upstream tag, rather than constructing one from the upstream
version. This assumes you know what you are doing.

−C

Sets the name of the builder
program invoked, nominally set to dpkg-buildpackage.
However, the user may choose to use a different build
program, or a wrapper, or even ’chroot /opt/root
dpkg-buildpackage’ to build the package in a
chroot jail, if desired. (Obviously, this requires
that the Work directory to be a subdirectory of a previously
set up chroot jail). One may also hook in pbuilder by
setting this variable to ’pdebuild --auto-debsign
--buildresult ../’. (Again, this requires
that pbuilder has been set up correctly). This argument
overrides the settings in the environment variable
CVSDEB_BUILDPACKAGE, and the configuration file
variable conf_buildpackage.

−G

This option, if set, should
contain a command to execute to get the original tarball
into the current directory. This can then be used to allow
one to get the original file using, for instance,
wget or curl. This overrides the
CVSDEB_GET_ORIG environment variable and the
conf_get_orig configuration file option.

−A

Use apt-get source to retrive the original
tarball. This option has no effect unless a source package
with the correct upstream version has already been uploaded
and is referenced from a Sources file known to
apt. If −A and −G are both
given, −G is tried first, and apt is
used only if that did not produce the tarball. This
overrides the CVSDEB_USE_APT environment variable and
the conf_use_apt configuration file option.

−R

Root of the original sources
archive. We expect to find the
_.orig.tar.gz
file under
/package name>/
unless the cvs-buildpackage work directory has been set, or
we want to export the original sources from the vendor
branch of the CVS tree. If the cvs-buildpackage work
directory is set anywhere, (command line, configuration
file, environment variable), the root directory value is
ignored, since we only need the root directory to set
defaults for the cvs-buildpackage work directory. This
argument overrides the settings in the environment variable
CVSDEB_ROOTDIR, and the configuration file variable
conf_rootdir. Please note that the cvs-buildpackage
work directory referred to here is the scratch directory
where this program works, not the directory that the human
uses to work in. This should probably not be a sub dir of
CVSROOT, since cvs shall refuse to export packages
there, and the script shall fail.

−W

The full path name for the
cvs-buildpackage working directory, into which the sources
will be exported out of CVS and which should contain the
original
_.orig.tar.gz
Please note that it is not strictly essential to have the
original sources, as this script will check out the vendor
branch version tagged as
upstream_version_ (without the Debian
revision). However, these recreated original sources are
likely to be different for consecutive runs of
cvs-buildpackage, and very likely to be different from the
pristine original sources (different enough to cause
problems with an upload). Thus it is strongly
advisable to keep the orig.tar.gz file around. Setting this
variable overrides the settings for the root directory. This
argument also overrides the settings in the environment
variable CVSDEB_WORKDIR, and the configuration file
variable conf_workdir. Please note that the
cvs-buildpackage work directory referred to here is the
scratch directory where this program works, not the
directory that the human uses to work in. Also, you should
specify an absolute path name for the work directory. This
should probably not be a sub dir of CVSROOT, since
cvs shall refuse to export packages there, and the script
shall fail.

−F

The Force Tag option. This only has effect if run in the
source directory. If set, it forces a cvs tag
−F operation to be performed before exporting the
sources. This argument overrides the settings in the
environment variable CVSDEB_FORCETAG, and the
configuration file variable conf_forcetag. The
default action is not to force a tag before export.

−E

The Full Export option. Normally, cvs-buildpackage will
export all the data from CVS using cvs export. If the
orig.tar.gz is not available in the working directory, the
full tree will be exported from CVS regardless of whether
this option is set or not. This option overrides the
environment variable CVSDEB_FULLEXPORT, and the
configuration file variable conf_fullexport.

−op

The opposite of full export. Using this option resets
the value of full export. Normally, cvs-buildpackage will
export all the data from CVS using cvs export. With
this option set, cvs-buildpackage will extract the
orig.tar.gz in the cvs-buildpackage working directory, and
then use the cvs rdiff command to bring that tree
up-to-date with the CVS tree we’re building. Please
look at the −f option to see
how to massage the source tree after extraction and
patching. 

−ctp

Include package_ at the start of the CVS
tag. This overrides the CVSDEB_PACKAGEINTAG
environment variable and the conf_forcetag
configuration file option. The default is not to include the
prefix. 

−n

The no exec (or dry-run) option, causing
cvs−buildpackage to print out all actions that
would be taken without actually executing them.

−f

This option, if set, should
point to a script that should be run just from the top level
of the source tree to set up permissions of scripts that
have been created by pathching the sources from an recently
extracted original tar file (the behaviour attained by
setting the −op option. This script is called
with two arguments, the package name, and version. This
script is only relevant when that option has been used.
There a number of variables that are exported into the
environment, for example package contains the name of
the package, non_epoch_version contains the version
of the package without the epoch, upstream_version
contains the upstream version. debian_version
contains the debian revision. cvstag contains the cvs
tag, and cvs_upstream_tag contains the tag for the
upstream version.

−H

This option, if set, should
point to a script that should be run just before calling
dpkg−buildpackage. Ideally, things like this
are done using the modules file and programs, but is still
provided here for convenience. This script is called with
two arguments, the package name, and version. There a number
of variables that are exported into the environment, for
example package contains the name of the package,
non_epoch_version contains the version of the package
without the epoch, upstream_version contains the
upstream version. debian_version contains the debian
revision. cvstag contains the cvs tag, and
cvs_upstream_tag contains the tag for the upstream
version. This argument overrides the settings in the
environment variable CVSDEB_HOOK which in turn over
rides the configuration file option
conf_hook_script.

−x

This option provides the CVS
default module prefix (should really fix the CVS modules
file). This argument overrides the settings in the
environment variable CVSDEB_PREFIX. Note: The
configuration file variable conf_prefix is not honoured
by cvs−buildpackage, since the prefix is required
to calculate the variables that are supposed to be defined
when we load the config file (chicken and egg problem).

The rest of the
command line arguments are passed on, uninterpreted, to
dpkg−buildpackage, though we do pay attention
to the -r (root command) option (which gives the
command to achieve root access, usually sudo,
fakeroot, or super ). The -r option overrides the
other means of setting the root command, namely, the
environment variable CVSDEB_ROOTCOMMAND, which in
turn overrides the config file option
conf_rootcommand. No attempt is made to check any
other option. Please use the −h option to see which of
the dpkg−buildpackage options are supported and
passed on.

FILES

Apart from the
runtime options, cvs−buildpackage also looks
for site−wide defaults in the file
/etc/cvsdeb.conf. After that, it looks for and reads
~/.cvsdeb.conf . The default configuration allows
there to be a site wide override for the root or the
cvs-buildpackage working directories on the site, but the
cvsdeb.conf files are actually Bourne shell snippets,
and any legal shell directives may be included in there.
Note: Caution is urged with this file, since you can
totally change the way that the script behaves by suitable
editing this file.
