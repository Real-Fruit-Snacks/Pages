dates ...

DESCRIPTION

dp is a
program that parses dates according to the ARPA Internet
standard. It also understands many non-standard formats,
such as those produced by TOPS-20 sites and some Unix sites
using ctime(3). It is useful for seeing how
nmh will interpret a date.

The dp
program treats each argument as a single date, and prints
the date out in the official RFC 822 format. Hence, it is
usually best to enclose each argument in quotes for the
shell.

To override the
output format used by dp, the -format
string or -format file switches are
used. This permits individual fields of the address to be
extracted with ease. The string is simply a format string
and the file is simply a format file. See
mh-format(5) for the details.

Here is the
default format string used by dp:

%

which says that
if an error was detected, print the error, a
’:’, and the date in error. Otherwise, output
the RFC 822-proper format of the date.
