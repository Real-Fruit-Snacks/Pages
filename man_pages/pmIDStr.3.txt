NAME

pmIDStr,
pmIDStr_r - convert a performance metric identifier
into a string

C SYNOPSIS

#include

const char
*pmIDStr(pmID pmid); 
char *pmIDStr_r(pmID pmid, char
*buf, int buflen);

cc ...
-lpcp

DESCRIPTION

For use in
error and diagnostic messages, pmIDStr returns a
’human readable’ version of the specified
Performance Metric Identifier (PMID). The pmIDStr_r
function does the same, but stores the result in a
user-supplied buffer buf of length buflen,
which should have room for at least 20 bytes.

Internally, a
PMID is encoded with three fields: domain, cluster and item.
pmIDStr returns a string with each of the fields
appearing as decimal numbers, separated by periods.

The string
value result from pmIDStr is held in a single static
buffer, so the returned value is only valid until the next
call to pmIDStr.

NOTES

pmIDStr
returns a pointer to a static buffer and hence is not
thread-safe. Multi-threaded applications should use
pmIDStr_r instead.

PCP ENVIRONMENT

Environment
variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On
each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains
the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5). Values for these
variables may be obtained programmatically using the
pmGetConfig(3) function.
