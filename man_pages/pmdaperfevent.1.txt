NAME

pmdaperfevent
- hardware performance counter performance metrics domain
agent (PMDA)

SYNOPSIS

$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/perfevent/pmdaperfevent
[-d domain] [-l logfile]
[-U username] [-i port]
[-p] [-u socket] [-6]

DESCRIPTION

pmdaperfevent
is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) that configures
and reads the hardware performance counters using the Linux
kernel perf_event API.

The
perfevent PMDA exports metrics for hardware
performance counters that are configurable from the Linux
kernel perf_event API. The PMDA uses the libpfm4 library to
access the hardware performance counters so any counters
that are supported in libpfm4 should be available. Also
included is the ability to read the Intel RAPL counters via
direct MSR access. The PMDA supports automatically loading
different counters for each hardware architecture. A single
configuration file is used to specify the desired counters
for each hardware performance monitoring unit (PMU). The
configuration file allows different counters to be
programmed on different CPUs and supports round-robin
assignment of uncore counters needed for some AMD chips.

The PMDA also
counts for events exposed in the kernel via
/sys/bus/event_source/devices directory. The PMU device name
and the event name must be mentioned in the configuration
file. Otherwise, the metric won&rsquo;t be available to
monitor through this PMDA.

The PMDA
configures the counters to count events in both user and
kernel mode. This means that the hardware counters are
unavailable to use by normal unprivileged user applications
when they are in use by the PMDA. The PMDA provides a
mechanism to temporarily disable the system-wide counters in
order to allow normal users to be able to use the counters
if they wish. See perfalloc(1) for details.

Note that
pmdaperfevent is affected by the value of the
kernel.perf_event_paranoid setting, which can be
adjusted by sysctl(8).

A brief
description of the pmdaperfevent command line options
follows:

-d

It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics
domain number specified here is unique and
consistent. That is, domain should be different for
every PMDA on the one host, and the same domain
number should be used for the same PMDA on all hosts.

-l

Location of the log file. By default, a log file named
perfevent.log is written in the current directory of
pmcd(1) when pmdaperfevent is started, i.e.
$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd. If the log file cannot be created
or is not writable, output is written to the standard error
instead. 

-U

User account under which to run the agent. The default
is the privileged "root" account.

-i

listen on given port number for connection from
pmcd(1) 

-p

communicate with pmcd(1) via stdin/stdout

-u

expect pmcd(1) to connect on given unix domain
socket 

-6

expect pmcd(1) to connect on given ipv6 port
(number or name)

INSTALLATION

The
perfevent PMDA is not activated by default To install
the PMDA, do the following as root:

# cd
$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/perfevent 
# ./Install

If you want to
undo the installation, do the following as root:

# cd
$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/perfevent 
# ./Remove

pmdaperfevent
is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be executed
directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify
pmcd(1) when the agent is installed or removed.

UPGRADING

Some metric
names have changed starting in version 3.10.8 to better
conform to PMNS conventions. pmlogrewrite(1) can be
used to update old archives. A helper utility,
$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/perfevent/perfevent-makerewrite.pl
will generate a config file that is suitable for use with
pmlogrewrite(1) to update the metric names in
existing archives.

BUGS

Each event is
placed in its own group and there is no way to group related
events together so they are guaranteed to be simultaneously
active. A workaround for this is to ensure that the number
of configured events is less than or equal to the number of
available hardware counters. This means that the events will
not be time-multiplexed by the kernel and will be
simultaneously active.

PCP ENVIRONMENT

Environment
variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On
each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains
the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).
