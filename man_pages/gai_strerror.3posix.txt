PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       gai_strerror — address and name information error description

SYNOPSIS
       #include <netdb.h>

       const char *gai_strerror(int ecode);

DESCRIPTION
       The gai_strerror() function shall return a text  string  describing  an
       error value for the getaddrinfo() and getnameinfo() functions listed in
       the <netdb.h> header.

       When the ecode argument is one of the following values  listed  in  the
       <netdb.h> header:

       [EAI_AGAIN]      [EAI_NONAME]
       [EAI_BADFLAGS]   [EAI_OVERFLOW]
       [EAI_FAIL]       [EAI_SERVICE]
       [EAI_FAMILY]     [EAI_SOCKTYPE]
       [EAI_MEMORY]     [EAI_SYSTEM]

       the function return value shall point to a string describing the error.
       If the argument is not one of those values, the function shall return a
       pointer to a string whose contents indicate an unknown error.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, gai_strerror() shall return a pointer to an
       implementation-defined string.
