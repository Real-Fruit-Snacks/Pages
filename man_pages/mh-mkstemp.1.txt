NAME

mkstemp -
create a temporary file

SYNOPSIS

/usr/lib/mh/mkstemp

[-help] [-version]
[-directory directory] [-prefix

prefix] [-suffix
suffix]

DESCRIPTION

mkstemp
creates a temporary file using mkstemp(3), or if the
-suffix switch is available and used,
mkstemps(3). The file name identifies a unique, newly
created file, and always contains 6 characters that appear
to be random.

The
-directory switch specifies a directory in
which to create the file.

The
-prefix switch specifies an initial part, before the
6 characters, of the file name.

The
-suffix switch is only supported on platforms that
provide the mkstemps(3) library function. It
specifies a suffix to appear after the 6 characters;
if it should begin with a special character such as a
period, that must be explicit in suffix.

Unlike
arguments to most switches of other nmh commands, the
arguments to mkstemp switches can begin with a
dash.

EXIT STATUS

If
mkstemp successfully creates the temporary file, it
prints the file name on standard output and exits with
status 0. On failure, it prints a diagnostic message on
standard error and exits with status 1.
