NAME
       onionshare  - a tool for anonymously sharing and receiving files over a
       temporarily set up Tor Hidden service.

SYNOPSIS
       onionshare  [ -v ] [ --filenames filenames... ]

DESCRIPTION
       OnionShare lets you anonymously share files,  or  receive  files.  From
       version  2.2,  OnionShare can also be used as a webserver through which
       static HTML files can be served. OnionShare has four different  operat-
       ing  modes:  the  default for sharing files, receive mode for receiving
       files, public mode for sharing files with a large audience, and website
       mode.

       When  using  OnionShare, a web server is started, making OnionShare ac-
       cessible as a Tor Onion Service, over the Internet. An unguessable  ad-
       dress is generated and can be shared for the recipient to open in a tor
       client, such as Tor Browser, to download,  upload,  or  consult  files.
       Traffic  between  their  device  and  your onion service end-to-end en-
       crypted. No separate server or third  party  file-sharing  service  re-
       quired.  You  host  the files on your own computer, acting as a server,
       for as long as the program is running.

       OnionShare can be configured to run with it's built-in version of  tor,
       a  TorBrowser  or  system  tor  running  in the background. By default,
       OnionShare uses its built-in version of Tor.

       OnionShare's default behaviour is to shut down the hidden  service  and
       to stop once the files have been up or downloaded.

       Public  mode  In  case  of sharing the unguessable URL with many peers,
       please enable "Public mode", otherwise OnionShare might interpret  mul-
       tiple accesses as an attack and shut down the hidden service.

       Receive  Mode  lets  people  upload  files  to  your OnionShare via Tor
       Browser.

       Website Mode allows you to publish a website as an onion service.  When
       selecting  the files to share, make sure you select multiple files in a
       folder if you want the entire directory to be published as  a  website.
       When  the  directory contains an index.html file (along with any static
       files such as images, CSS etc), then the site will be viewable  on  the
       Tor network as an onion service as the actual website itself (not as an
       OnionShare interface). The  onion  service  will  render  HTML  in  Tor
       Browser  just  like any other website. If you don't have an index.html,
       OnionShare will show a directory listing of your files instead. In  di-
       rectory listing, each file can be opened, and there is no download but-
       ton for the compressed archive. OnionShare does not share your original
       website files. Instead, it creates a copy of those files in a temporary
       folder and shares those copies.

       Automatic start and stop The auto-start timer allows you to schedule  a
       share to start at some time in the future.
