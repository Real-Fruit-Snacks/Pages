createlang
âˆ’ define a new PostgreSQL procedural language

SYNOPSIS

createlang
[ connection-option... ] langname [
dbname ]

createlang
[ connection-option... ] --list | -l
dbname

DESCRIPTION

createlang
is a utility for adding a new programming language to a
PostgreSQL database. createlang can handle all the
languages supplied in the default PostgreSQL distribution,
but not languages provided by other parties.

Although
backend programming languages can be added directly using
several SQL commands, it is recommended to use
createlang because it performs a number of checks and
is much easier to use. See CREATE LANGUAGE
[create_language(7)] for additional information.

OPTIONS

createlang
accepts the following command-line arguments: 
langname

Specifies the name of the
procedural programming language to be defined.

[-d] dbname

[--dbname] dbname

Specifies to which database the
language should be added. The default is to use the database
with the same name as the current system user.

-e

--echo

Display SQL commands as they are executed.

-l

--list

Show a list of already installed languages in the target
database. 

-L directory

Specifies the directory in
which the language interpreter is to be found. The directory
is normally found automatically; this option is primarily
for debugging purposes.

createlang
also accepts the following command-line arguments for
connection parameters: 
-h host 
--host host

Specifies the host name of the
machine on which the server is running. If the value begins
with a slash, it is used as the directory for the Unix
domain socket.

-p port 
--port port

Specifies the TCP port or local
Unix domain socket file extension on which the server is
listening for connections.

-U username

--username username

User name to connect as.

-W

--password

Force password prompt.

ENVIRONMENT

PGDATABASE

PGHOST

PGPORT

PGUSER

Default connection parameters

DIAGNOSTICS

Most error
messages are self-explanatory. If not, run createlang
with the --echo option and see under the respective
SQL command for details.

NOTES

Use
droplang(1) to remove a language.

EXAMPLES

To install the
language pltcl into the database template1:

$ createlang
pltcl template1
