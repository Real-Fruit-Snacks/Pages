NAME

certpatch &mdash; add
subjectAltName identities to X.509 certificates

SYNOPSIS

certpatch
[-t identity-type] -i
identity -k signing-key input-certificate
output-certificate

DESCRIPTION

certpatch alters
PEM-encoded X.509 certificates by adding a subjectAltName
extension containing an identity used by the signature-based
authentication schemes of the ISAKMP protocol. After the
addition the certificate will be signed once again with the
supplied CA signing key.

The options are
as follows:

-t
identity-type

If given, the -t option
specifies the type of the given identity. Currently ip,
fqdn, and ufqdn are recognized. The default is ip.

-i identity

The -i option takes an
argument which is the identity to put into the
subjectAltName field of the certificate. If the
identity-type is ip, this argument should be an IPv4 address
in dotted decimal notation.

-k signing-key

The -k option specifies
the key used for signing the certificate once the
subjectAltName extension has been added. The key is
specified by the filename where it is stored in PEM
format.
