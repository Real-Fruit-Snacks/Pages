PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       wcspbrk — scan a wide-character string for a wide-character code

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       wchar_t *wcspbrk(const wchar_t *ws1, const wchar_t *ws2);

DESCRIPTION
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with  the
       ISO C  standard.  Any  conflict between the requirements described here
       and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017
       defers to the ISO C standard.

       The  wcspbrk()  function shall locate the first occurrence in the wide-
       character string pointed to by ws1 of any wide-character code from  the
       wide-character string pointed to by ws2.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon  successful  completion,  wcspbrk()  shall return a pointer to the
       wide-character code or a null pointer if no  wide-character  code  from
       ws2 occurs in ws1.

ERRORS
       No errors are defined.
