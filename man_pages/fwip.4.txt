FWIP(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual FWIP(4)

NAME

fwip &mdash; IP over
FireWire driver

SYNOPSIS

To compile this driver into the
kernel, place the following lines in your kernel
configuration file:

device
firewire 
device fwip

Alternatively,
to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following lines in loader.conf(5):

firewire_load="YES"

if_fwip_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION

The fwip driver provides
standard IP over FireWire (IEEE 1394) based on the protocols
described in RFC 2734 and RFC 3146.

The firewire(4)
and fwohci(4) drivers must be configured in the kernel as
well.

This driver
supports polling(4) as well if it is compiled with the
DEVICE_POLLING option.

fwohci(4), netintro(4), polling(4), ifconfig(8), kldload(8),
sysctl(8)

HISTORY

The fwip device driver
first appeared in FreeBSD 5.3.

AUTHORS

The fwip driver and this
manual page were written by Doug Rabson, based on earlier
work by Hidetoshi Shimokawa.

BUGS

This driver currently does not
support the MCAP protocol for multicast IP over FireWire.
Multicast packets are treated as broadcast packets which is
sufficient for most trivial uses of multicast.
