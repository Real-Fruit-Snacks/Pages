ImageMagick-im6.q16(1)      General Commands Manual     ImageMagick-im6.q16(1)

NAME
       ImageMagick  -  is a free software suite for the creation, modification
       and display of bitmap images.

SYNOPSIS
       convert-im6.q16 input-file [options] output-file

OVERVIEW
       Use ImageMagick® to create, edit, compose, or convert bitmap images. It
       can  read and write images in a variety of formats (over 200) including
       PNG, JPEG, GIF, HEIC, TIFF, DPX, EXR, WebP, Postscript, PDF,  and  SVG.
       Use  ImageMagick  to  resize,  flip, mirror, rotate, distort, shear and
       transform images, adjust image colors, apply various  special  effects,
       or draw text, lines, polygons, ellipses and B\['e]zier curves.

       The  functionality  of  ImageMagick is typically utilized from the com‐
       mand-line or you can use the features from programs written in your fa‐
       vorite  language.  Choose  from these interfaces: G2F (Ada), MagickCore
       (C), MagickWand (C), ChMagick (Ch), ImageMagickObject (COM+),  Magick++
       (C++),  JMagick (Java), JuliaIO (Julia), L-Magick (Lisp), Lua (LuaJIT),
       NMagick (Neko/haXe), Magick.NET (.NET), PascalMagick (Pascal), PerlMag‐
       ick  (Perl),  MagickWand  for  PHP  (PHP),  IMagick (PHP), PythonMagick
       (Python), magick (R), RMagick (Ruby), or  TclMagick  (Tcl/TK).  With  a
       language  interface, use ImageMagick to modify or create images dynami‐
       cally and automagically.

       ImageMagick utilizes multiple computational threads to increase perfor‐
       mance and can read, process, or write mega-, giga-, or tera-pixel image
       sizes.

       ImageMagick is free software delivered as a ready-to-run binary distri‐
       bution or as source code that you may use, copy, modify, and distribute
       in both open and proprietary applications. It is  distributed  under  a
       derived Apache 2.0 license.

       The  ImageMagick  development process ensures a stable API and ABI. Be‐
       fore each ImageMagick release, we perform a comprehensive security  as‐
       sessment  that  includes  memory error, thread data race detection, and
       continuous fuzzing to help prevent security vulnerabilities.

       The current release is ImageMagick 6.9.10-11. It runs  on  Linux,  Win‐
       dows, Mac Os X, iOS, Android OS, and others.

       The    authoritative    ImageMagick    version    6    web    site   is
       https://legacy.imagemagick.org. The authoritative source  code  reposi‐
       tory  is  https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick6.  We  maintain  a
       source code mirror at https://gitlab.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick6.

       The design of ImageMagick is an evolutionary process, with  the  design
       and  implementation  efforts  serving  to  influence  and guide further
       progress in the other. With ImageMagick version 7 we aim to improve the
       design based on lessons learned from the version 6 implementation.

       In the paragraphs below, find a short description for each command-line
       tool.Cl ick on the program name to get details on the program usage and
       a  list  of comman d-line options that alters how the program performs.
       If you are just getting acq uainted with ImageMagick, start at the  top
       of the list, the convert program, and
        work  your way down. Also be sure to peruse Anthony Thyssen's tutorial
       on how to
        use ImageMagick utilities to convert, compose, or edit images from the
       command- line.

       convert

              convert  between image formats as well as resize an image, blur,
              crop, despeckle, dither, draw on,  flip,  join,  re-sample,  and
              much more.

       identify

              describes  the  format  and characteristics of one or more image
              files.

       mogrify

              resize an image, blur, crop, despeckle, dither, draw  on,  flip,
              join,  re-sample, and much more. Mogrify overwrites the original
              image file, whereas, convert writes to a different image file.

       composite

              overlaps one image over another.

       montage

              create a composite image by combining several  separate  images.
              The  images  are tiled on the composite image optionally adorned
              with a border, frame, image name, and more.

       compare

              mathematically and visually annotate the difference  between  an
              image and its reconstruction..

       stream

              is  a lightweight tool to stream one or more pixel components of
              the image or portion of the image to your choice of storage for‐
              mats.  It  writes the pixel components as they are read from the
              input image a row at a time making stream desirable when working
              with large images or when you require raw pixel components.

       display

              displays an image or image sequence on any X server.

       animate

              animates an image sequence on any X server.

       import

              saves any visible window on an X server and outputs it as an im‐
              age file. You can capture a single window, the entire screen, or
              any rectangular portion of the screen.

       conjure

              interprets  and executes scripts written in the Magick Scripting
              Language (MSL).
