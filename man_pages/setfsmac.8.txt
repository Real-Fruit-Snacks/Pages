NAME

setfsmac &mdash; set MAC
label for a file hierarchy

SYNOPSIS

setfsmac
[&minus;ehqvx] [

&minus;f specfile ] ... [ 
&minus;s specfile ] ... file ...

DESCRIPTION

The setfsmac utility
accepts a list of specification files as input and sets the
MAC labels on the specified file system hierarchies. Path
names specified will be visited in order as given on the
command line, and each tree will be traversed in pre-order.
(Generally, it will not be very useful to use relative paths
instead of absolute paths.) Multiple entries matching a
single file will be combined and applied in a single
transaction.

The following
options are available:

&minus;e

Treat any file
systems encountered which do not support MAC labelling as
errors, instead of warning and skipping them.

&minus;f
specfile

Apply the specifications in
specfile to the specified paths. NOTE: Only the
first entry for each file is applied; all others are
disregarded and silently dropped. Multiple
&minus;f arguments may be specified to include
multiple specification files.

&minus;h

When a symbolic
link is encountered, change the label of the link rather
than the file the link points to.

&minus;q

Do not print
non-fatal warnings during execution.

&minus;s
specfile

Apply the specifications in
specfile, but assume the specification format is
compatible with the SELinux specfile format. NOTE:
Only the first entry for each file is applied; all others
are disregarded and silently dropped. The prefix
&rsquo;&rsquo;sebsd/&rsquo;&rsquo; will be automatically
prepended to the labels in specfile. Labels matching
&rsquo;&rsquo;>&rsquo;&rsquo; will be
explicitly not relabeled. This permits SEBSD to reuse
existing SELinux policy specification files.

&minus;v

Increase the
degree of verbosity.

&minus;x

Do not recurse
into new file systems when traversing them.
