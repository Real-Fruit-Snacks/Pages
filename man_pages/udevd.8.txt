NAME

udevd &minus;
event managing daemon

SYNOPSIS

udevd
[&minus;&minus;daemon] [&minus;&minus;debug]
[&minus;&minus;children&minus;max=]
[&minus;&minus;exec&minus;delay=]
[&minus;&minus;resolve&minus;names=early|late|never]
[&minus;&minus;version]
[&minus;&minus;help] 

DESCRIPTION

udevd listens
to kernel uevents. For every event, udevd executes matching
instructions specified in udev rules. See
udev(7).

On startup the
content of the directory /lib/udev/devices is copied to
/dev. If kernel modules specify static device nodes, these
nodes are created even wihtout a corresponding kernel
device, to allow on&minus;demand loading of kernel modules.
Matching permissions specified in udev rules are applied to
these static device nodes.

The behavior of
the running daemon can be changed with udevadm
control.

OPTIONS

&minus;&minus;daemon

Detach and run in the
background.

&minus;&minus;debug

Print debug messages to
stderr.

&minus;&minus;children&minus;max=

Limit the number of parallel
executed events.

&minus;&minus;exec&minus;delay=

Number of seconds to delay the
execution of RUN instructions. This might be useful when
debugging system crashes during coldplug cause by loading
non&minus;working kernel modules.

&minus;&minus;resolve&minus;names=

Specify when udevd should
resolve names of users and groups. When set to early
(the default) names will be resolved when the rules are
parsed. When set to late names will be resolved for
every event. When set to never names will never be
resolved and all devices will be owned by root.

&minus;&minus;version

Print version number.

&minus;&minus;help

Print help text.

ENVIRONMENT

UDEV_LOG=

Set the logging priority.

KERNEL COMMAND LINE

udev.log&minus;priority=

Set the logging priority.

udev.children&minus;max=

Limit the number of parallel
executed events.

udev.exec&minus;delay=

Number of seconds to delay the
execution of RUN instructions. This might be useful when
debugging system crashes during coldplug cause by loading
non&minus;working kernel modules.
