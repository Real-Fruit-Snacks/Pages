MAC.CONF(5) BSD File Formats Manual MAC.CONF(5)

NAME

mac.conf &mdash; format
of the MAC library configuration file

DESCRIPTION

The mac.conf file
configures the default label elements to be used by
policy-agnostic applications that operate on MAC labels. A
file contains a series of default label sets specified by
object class, in addition to blank lines and comments
preceded by a &rsquo;#&rsquo; symbol.

Each declaration
consists of a single line with two fields separated by white
space: the object class name, and a list of label elements
as used by the mac_prepare(3) library calls prior to an
application invocation of a function from mac_get(3). Label
element names may optionally begin with a &rsquo;?&rsquo;
symbol to indicate that a failure to retrieve the label
element for an object should be silently ignored, and
improves usability if the set of MAC policies may change
over time.

EXAMPLES

The following example configures
user applications to operate with four MAC policies:
mac_biba(4), mac_mls(4), SEBSD, and mac_partition(4).

# 
# Default label set to be used by simple MAC applications

#

default_file_labels
?biba,?mls,?sebsd 
default_ifnet_labels ?biba,?mls,?sebsd 
default_process_labels ?biba,?mls,partition,?sebsd

In this example,
userland applications will attempt to retrieve Biba, MLS,
and SEBSD labels for all object classes; for processes, they
will additionally attempt to retrieve a Partition
identifier. In all cases except the Partition identifier,
failure to retrieve a label due to the respective policy not
being present will be ignored.

HISTORY

Support for Mandatory Access
Control was introduced in FreeBSD 5.0 as part of the
TrustedBSD Project.

BUGS

The TrustedBSD MAC Framework and
associated policies, interfaces, and applications are
considered to be an experimental feature in FreeBSD. Sites
considering production deployment should keep the
experimental status of these services in mind during any
deployment process. See also mac(9) for related
considerations regarding the kernel framework.
