NAME
       pjtoppm - convert an HP PaintJet file to a PPM image

SYNOPSIS
       pjtoppm

       [paintjet]

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       pjtoppm  reads  an HP PaintJet file as input and converts it into a PPM
       image.  This was a quick hack to save some trees, and it only handles a
       small  subset  of  the  paintjet commands.  In particular, it will only
       handle enough commands to convert most raster image files.

OPTIONS
       There are no command line options defined specifically for pjtoppm, but
       it  recognizes  the  options  common to all programs based on libnetpbm
       (See
        Common Options ⟨index.html#commonoptions⟩ .)
