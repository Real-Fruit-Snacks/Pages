WLAN_WEP(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual WLAN_WEP(4)

NAME

wlan_wep &mdash; WEP
crypto support for 802.11 devices

SYNOPSIS

device wlan_wep

DESCRIPTION

The wlan_wep module
handles the WEP cryptographic requirements of the 802.11
protocol. It does encapsulation and decapsulation of
WEP-encoded 802.11 frames and optionally calculates the WEP
cipher. The wlan_wep module is an 802.11
cryptographic plugin module for use by the wlan(4) module.
This module is automatically loaded if a WEP key is
configured with ifconfig(8). Should the underlying network
device not be capable of doing the WEP calculations in
hardware, the wlan_wep module will do the work.
