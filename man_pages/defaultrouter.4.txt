NAME

defaultrouter
− configuration file for default router(s)

SYNOPSIS

/etc/defaultrouter

DESCRIPTION

The
/etc/defaultrouter file specifies a IPv4 host’s
default router(s).

The format of
the file is as follows:

IP_address 
...

The
/etc/defaultrouter file can contain the IP addresses
or hostnames of one or more default routers, with each entry
on its own line. If you use hostnames, each hostname must
also be listed in the local /etc/hosts file, because
no name services are running at the time that
defaultrouter is read.

Lines beginning
with the ’’#’’ character are treated
as comments.

The default
routes listed in this file replace those added by the kernel
during diskless booting. An empty /etc/defaultrouter
file will cause the default route added by the kernel to be
deleted.

Use of a
default route, whether received from a DHCP server or
from /etc/defaultrouter, prevents a machine from
acting as an IPv4 router, even if that machine does not have
an /etc/notrouter file.

FILES

/etc/defaultrouter

Configuration file containing
the hostnames or IP addresses of one or more default
routers.
