NAME

sadt - simple
DEP-8 test runner

SYNOPSIS

sadt
[options] [test-name...]

DESCRIPTION

sadt is
a simple implementation of DEP-8
(&ldquo;automatic as-installed package testing&rdquo;) test
runner.

It is your
responsibility to satisfy tests&rsquo; dependencies.
sadt won&rsquo;t attempt to install any missing
packages. If a test&rsquo;s dependencies cannot be satisfied
by packages that are currently installed, the test will be
skipped.

sadt
won&rsquo;t build the package even if a test declares the
build-needed restriction. Instead, such a test will
be skipped. However, you can build the package manually, and
then tell sadt to assume that the package is already
built using the -b/--built-source-tree.

sadt
doesn&rsquo;t implement any virtualisation arrangements,
therefore it skips tests that declare the
breaks-testbed restriction.

OPTIONS

-v,
--verbose

Make the output more
verbose.

-b,
--built-source-tree

Assume that the source tree is
already built. This is equivalent to
--ignore-restriction=build-needed.

--run-autodep8,
--no-run-autodep8

Control whether to run
autodep8(1) to determine the tests to run. By
default, autodep8 will be run.

--ignore-restriction=restriction

Don&rsquo;t skip tests that
declare the restriction.

-h, --help

Show a help message and
exit.
