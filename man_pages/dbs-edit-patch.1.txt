EXAMPLES

Edit the
021_debian patch of Heimdal:

~/heimdal&minus;0.3d$
dbs&minus;edit&minus;patch &minus;t/tmp 021_debian

Extracting source heimdal&minus;0.3d.tar.gz ... successful.

Applying patch 001_replay ... successful. 
etc. 
Copying heimdal&minus;0.3d to heimdal&minus;0.3d&minus;old
... successful. 
Applying patch 021_debian ... successful.

Edit files
under /tmp/021_debian/heimdal&minus;0.3d as required, then
execute /tmp/021_debian/dbs_update_patch to save the
results.

Technote:
dbs&minus;edit&minus;patch extracts the original source code
into /tmp/021_debian/heimdal&minus;0.3d, applies all patches
before 021_debian, copies the result to
/tmp/021_debian/heimdal&minus;0.3d&minus;old, and applies
the last patch 021_debian (if it exists). Also, it creates a
shell archive which will create the diff between the old and
new directories:

~/heimdal&minus;0.3d$
ls &minus;l /tmp/021_debian 
total 12 
&minus;rwxr&minus;xr&minus;x 1 bam users 112 Jan 31 13:31
dbs&minus;update&minus;patch* 
drwxr&minus;xr&minus;x 14 bam users 4096 Jan 31 13:31
heimdal&minus;0.3d/ 
drwxr&minus;xr&minus;x 14 bam users 4096 Jan 31 13:31
heimdal&minus;0.3d&minus;old/ 
~/heimdal&minus;0.3d$ cat
/tmp/021_debian/dbs&minus;update&minus;patch 
#!/bin/sh 
diff &minus;ruN /tmp/021_debian/heimdal&minus;0.3d
/tmp/021_debian/heimdal&minus;0.3d&minus;old >
./debian/patches/021_debian
