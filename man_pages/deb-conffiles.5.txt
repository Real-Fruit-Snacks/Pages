NAME

deb-conffiles -
package conffiles

SYNOPSIS

DEBIAN/conffiles

DESCRIPTION

A package
declares its list of conffiles by including a
conffiles file in its control archive (i.e.
DEBIAN/conffiles during package creation).

This file
contains a list of files, one per line. They should be
listed as absolute pathnames, and should exist in the binary
package, otherwise dpkg(1) will ignore them (although
by default dpkg-deb(1) will refuse to build such
binary packages). Trailing whitespace will be trimmed, and
empty lines will be ignored.

EXAMPLE

 /etc/alternatives/README
 /etc/cron.daily/dpkg
 /etc/dpkg/dpkg.cfg
 /etc/logrotate.d/dpkg
