DESCRIPTION

mount
attaches a file system to the file system hierarchy at the
mount_point, which is the pathname of a directory. If
mount_point has any contents prior to the
mount operation, these are hidden until the file
system is unmounted.

umount
unmounts a currently mounted file system, which may be
specified either as a mount_point or as
special, the device on which the file system
resides.

The table of
currently mounted file systems can be found by examining the
mounted file system information file. This is provided by a
file system that is usually mounted on /etc/mnttab.
The mounted file system information is described in
mnttab(4). Mounting a file system adds an entry to
the mount table; a umount removes an entry from the
table.

When invoked
with both the special and mount_point
arguments and the -F option, mount validates
all arguments except for special and invokes the
appropriate FSType-specific mount module. If
invoked with no arguments, mount lists all the
mounted file systems recorded in the mount table,
/etc/mnttab. If invoked with a partial argument list
(with only one of special or mount_point, or
with both special or mount_point specified but
not FSType), mount will search
/etc/vfstab for an entry that will supply the missing
arguments. If no entry is found, and the special argument
starts with "/", the default local file system
type specified in /etc/default/fs will be used.
Otherwise the default remote file system type will be used.
The default remote file system type is determined by the
first entry in the /etc/dfs/fstypes file. After
filling in missing arguments, mount will invoke the
FSType-specific mount module.

Only a
super-user can mount or unmount file systems using
mount and umount. However, any user can use
mount to list mounted file systems and resources.

OPTIONS

-F
FSType

Used to specify the
FSType on which to operate. The FSType must be
specified or must be determinable from /etc/vfstab,
or by consulting /etc/default/fs or
/etc/dfs/fstypes.

-a [
mount_points. . . ]

Perform mount or umount
operations in parallel, when possible.

If mount points
are not specified, mount will mount all file systems
whose /etc/vfstab "mount at boot" field is
"yes". If mount points are specified, then
/etc/vfstab "mount at boot" field will be
ignored.

If mount points
are specified, umount will only umount those
mount points. If none is specified, then umount will
attempt to unmount all file systems in
/etc/mnttab, with the exception of certain system
required file systems: /, /usr, /var,
/var/adm, /var/run, /proc,
/dev/fd and /tmp.

-f

Forcibly unmount a file system.

Without this
option, umount does not allow a file system to be
unmounted if a file on the file system is busy. Using this
option can cause data loss for open files; programs which
access files after the file system has been unmounted will
get an error (EIO).

-p

Print the list of mounted file
systems in the /etc/vfstab format. Must be the only
option specified. See BUGS.

-v

Print the list of mounted file systems in verbose
format. Must be the only option specified.

-V

Echo the complete command line, but do not execute the
command. umount generates a command line by using the
options and arguments provided by the user and adding to
them information derived from /etc/mnttab. This
option should be used to verify and validate the command
line. 

generic_options

Options that are commonly
supported by most FSType-specific command modules.
The following options are available:

-m

Mount the file system without making an entry in
/etc/mnttab. 

-g

Globally mount the file system. On a clustered system,
this globally mounts the file system on all nodes of the
cluster. On a non-clustered system this has no effect.

-o

Specify FSType-specific options in a comma
separated (without spaces) list of suboptions and
keyword-attribute pairs for interpretation by the
FSType-specific module of the command. (See
mount_ufs(1M).) When you use -o with a file
system that has an entry in /etc/vfstab, any
mount options entered for that file system in
/etc/vfstab are ignored.

-O

Overlay mount. Allow the file system to be mounted over
an existing mount point, making the underlying file system
inaccessible. If a mount is attempted on a pre-existing
mount point without setting this flag, the mount will fail,
producing the error "device busy".

-r

Mount the file system read-only.

USAGE

See
largefile(5) for the description of the behavior of
mount and umount when encountering files
greater than or equal to 2 Gbyte ( 2**31 bytes).

FILES

/etc/mnttab

Table of mounted file
systems.

/etc/default/fs

Default local file system type.
Default values can be set for the following flags in
/etc/default/fs. For example: LOCAL=ufs 
LOCAL:

The default partition for a
command if no FSType is specified.

/etc/vfstab

List of default parameters for
each file system.

ATTRIBUTES

See
attributes(5) for descriptions of the following
attributes:

NOTES

If the
directory on which a file system is to be mounted is a
symbolic link, the file system is mounted on the directory
to which the symbolic link refers, rather than on top of the
symbolic link itself.

BUGS

The mount
-p output is incorrect for cachefs.
