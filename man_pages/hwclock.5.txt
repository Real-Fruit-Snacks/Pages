HWCLOCK(5)               Debian Administrator's Manual              HWCLOCK(5)

NAME
       hwclock - settings that affect the behaviour of the hwclock init script

DESCRIPTION
       The /etc/default/hwclock file contains settings in POSIX format:

            VAR=VAL

       Only  one assignment is allowed per line.  Comments (starting with '#')
       are also allowed.

SETTINGS
       The following settings can be set.

       HCTOSYS_DEVICE
              The hardware clock device you want to use.   Defaults  to  rtc0.
              It  should  probably  match the CONFIG_RTC_HCTOSYS_DEVICE kernel
              config option.

              If you change this, you also need to install a custom udev rule,
              mirroring /usr/lib/udev/rules.d/85-hwclock.rules. Otherwise, the
              hardware clock device will be ignored during boot.

              On almost all systems, this should not be changed.

NOTES
       On systems using systemd as init, the hwclock init script is ignored.
