READLINK(3POSIX)           POSIX Programmer's Manual          READLINK(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       readlink, readlinkat — read the contents of a symbolic link

SYNOPSIS
       #include <unistd.h>

       ssize_t readlink(const char *restrict path, char *restrict buf,
           size_t bufsize);

       #include <fcntl.h>

       ssize_t readlinkat(int fd, const char *restrict path,
           char *restrict buf, size_t bufsize);

DESCRIPTION
       The readlink() function shall place the contents of the  symbolic  link
       referred  to  by path in the buffer buf which has size bufsize.  If the
       number of bytes in the symbolic link is less than bufsize, the contents
       of  the  remainder  of  buf are unspecified. If the buf argument is not
       large enough to contain the link content, the first bufsize bytes shall
       be placed in buf.

       If  the value of bufsize is greater than {SSIZE_MAX}, the result is im‐
       plementation-defined.

       Upon successful completion, readlink() shall mark for update  the  last
       data access timestamp of the symbolic link.

       The  readlinkat()  function shall be equivalent to the readlink() func‐
       tion except in the case where path specifies a relative path.  In  this
       case  the symbolic link whose content is read is relative to the direc‐
       tory associated with the file descriptor  fd  instead  of  the  current
       working  directory. If the access mode of the open file description as‐
       sociated with the file descriptor is not O_SEARCH, the  function  shall
       check  whether  directory searches are permitted using the current per‐
       missions of the directory underlying the file descriptor. If the access
       mode is O_SEARCH, the function shall not perform the check.

       If  readlinkat() is passed the special value AT_FDCWD in the fd parame‐
       ter, the current working directory shall be used and the behavior shall
       be identical to a call to readlink().

RETURN VALUE
       Upon  successful  completion, these functions shall return the count of
       bytes placed in the buffer. Otherwise, these functions shall  return  a
       value  of -1, leave the buffer unchanged, and set errno to indicate the
       error.

ERRORS
       These functions shall fail if:

       EACCES Search permission is denied for a component of the  path  prefix
              of path.

       EINVAL The path argument names a file that is not a symbolic link.

       EIO    An I/O error occurred while reading from the file system.

       ELOOP  A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during resolution of
              the path argument.

       ENAMETOOLONG
              The  length  of  a  component  of  a  pathname  is  longer  than
              {NAME_MAX}.

       ENOENT A component of path does not name an existing file or path is an
              empty string.

       ENOTDIR
              A component of the path prefix names an existing  file  that  is
              neither  a  directory nor a symbolic link to a directory, or the
              path argument contains at least one  non-<slash>  character  and
              ends  with  one or more trailing <slash> characters and the last
              pathname component names an existing file that is neither a  di‐
              rectory nor a symbolic link to a directory.

       The readlinkat() function shall fail if:

       EACCES The  access mode of the open file description associated with fd
              is not O_SEARCH and the permissions of the directory  underlying
              fd do not permit directory searches.

       EBADF  The  path  argument does not specify an absolute path and the fd
              argument is neither AT_FDCWD nor a valid  file  descriptor  open
              for reading or searching.

       ENOTDIR
              The  path  argument is not an absolute path and fd is a file de‐
              scriptor associated with a non-directory file.

       These functions may fail if:

       ELOOP  More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were  encountered  during
              resolution of the path argument.

       ENAMETOOLONG
              The length of a pathname exceeds {PATH_MAX}, or pathname resolu‐
              tion of a symbolic link produced an intermediate result  with  a
              length that exceeds {PATH_MAX}.

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
   Reading the Name of a Symbolic Link
       The  following  example  shows  how to read the name of a symbolic link
       named /modules/pass1.

           #include <unistd.h>

           char buf[1024];
           ssize_t len;
           ...
           if ((len = readlink("/modules/pass1", buf, sizeof(buf)-1)) != -1)
               buf[len] = '\0';

APPLICATION USAGE
       Conforming applications should not assume that the returned contents of
       the symbolic link are null-terminated.

RATIONALE
       The  type  associated with bufsiz is a size_t in order to be consistent
       with both the ISO C standard and the definition of read().  The  behav‐
       ior  specified for readlink() when bufsiz is zero represents historical
       practice. For this case, the standard developers  considered  a  change
       whereby  readlink() would return the number of non-null bytes contained
       in the symbolic link with the buffer buf remaining unchanged;  however,
       since  the stat structure member st_size value can be used to determine
       the size of buffer necessary to contain the contents  of  the  symbolic
       link  as  returned  by  readlink(), this proposal was rejected, and the
       historical practice retained.

       The purpose of the readlinkat() function is to read the content of sym‐
       bolic  links  in  directories  other than the current working directory
       without exposure to race conditions.  Any part of the path  of  a  file
       could  be changed in parallel to a call to readlink(), resulting in un‐
       specified behavior. By opening a file descriptor for the target  direc‐
       tory  and using the readlinkat() function it can be guaranteed that the
       symbolic link read is located relative to the desired directory.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
