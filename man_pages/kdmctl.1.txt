NAME

kdmctl &minus;
kdm remote control application

SYNOPSIS

kdmctl
[options] [command [command arguments]]

DESCRIPTION

kdmctl
is an application to remote&minus;control kdm. It
makes use of UNIX domain sockets.

There are two
types of sockets: the global one (dmctl) and the
per&minus;display ones (dmctl&minus;). The
global one&rsquo;s subdir is owned by root, the subdirs of
the per&minus;display ones&rsquo; are owned by the user
currently owning the session (root or the logged in
user).

The directory
in which the sockets are located is determined this way:

&minus; the &minus;s
option is examined 
&minus; the $DM_CONTROL variable is examined 
&minus; the kdm config file is searched for the FifoDir key

&minus;/var/run/xdmctl and /var/run are tried

If $DISPLAY is
set (or &minus;d was specified) and &minus;g
was not specified, the display&minus;specific control socket
will be used, otherwise the global one.

Tokens in the
command and the reply are tab&minus;separated. Command
arguments can be specified as separate command line
parameters, in which case they are simply concatenated with
tabs in between.

If the command
is &rsquo;&minus;&rsquo;, kdmctl reads commands from
stdin. The default command is &rsquo;caps&rsquo;.

OPTIONS

Options:

&minus;h &minus;help

print help message.

&minus;g
&minus;global

Use global control socket even
if $DISPLAY is set

&minus;d
&minus;display

Override $DISPLAY

&minus;s
&minus;sockets

Override $DM_CONTROL

&minus;c
&minus;config

Use alternative kdm config
file

Commands:

Global commands:

login

display (now|schedule) user password
[session_arguments] 

login user at specified
display. if "now" is specified, a possibly running
session is killed, otherwise the login is done after the
session exits. 
session_arguments are printf&minus;like escaped contents for
.dmrc. Unlisted keys will default to previously saved
values.

Per&minus;display
commands:

lock

The display is marked as locked.
If the X&minus;Server crashes in this state, no
auto&minus;relogin will be performed even if the option is
on. 

unlock

Reverse the effect of "lock": re&minus;enable
auto&minus;relogin. 

suicide

The currently running session
is forcibly terminated. No auto&minus;relogin is attempted,
but a scheduled "login" command will be
executed.

Commands for
all sockets:

caps

Returns a list of this socket&rsquo;s capabilities:

&minus; kdm

identifies kdm, in case some
other DM implements this protocol, too.

&minus; list, activate, lock,
suicide, login

the respective command is
supported.

&minus; bootoptions

the "listbootoptions"
command and the "=" option to "shutdown"
are supported.

&minus; shutdown

"shutdown" is
supported and allowed to the listed users
(comma&minus;separated). "*" means all
authenticated users.

&minus; shutdown

"shutdown" is
supported and allowed to everybody.

&minus; nuke 

forced shutdown is allowed to
the listed users.

&minus; nuke

forced shutdown is allowed to
everybody.

&minus; reserve

reserve displays are configured
and  are available at this time.

list [all|alllocal]

Return a list of running
sessions. By default all active sessions are listed. If
"all" is specified, passive sessions are listed as
well. If "alllocal" is specified, passive sessions
are listed as well, but all incoming remote sessions are
skipped.

Each session
entry is a comma&minus;separated tuple of: 
&minus; Display or TTY name 
&minus; VT name for local sessions 
&minus; Logged in user&rsquo;s name, empty for passive
sessions and outgoing 
remote sessions (local chooser mode) 
&minus; Session type or remote host for outgoing remote
sessions, 
empty for passive sessions 
&minus; A flag field:

&minus; "t" for tty
sessions 
&minus; "*" for the display belonging to the
requesting socket 
&minus; "!" for sessions that cannot be killed by
the requesting 
socket 
&minus; New flags might be added later

&minus; New fields might be
added later

reserve [timeout in
seconds]

Start a reserve login screen.
If nobody logs in within the specified amount of time (one
minute by default), the display is removed again. When the
session on the display exits, the display is removed, too.

Permitted only on sockets of local displays and the global
socket.

activate
(vt|display)

Switch to a particular VT
(virtual terminal). The VT may be specified either directly
(e.g., vt3) or by a display using it (e.g., :2). 
Permitted only on sockets of local displays and the global
socket.

listbootoptions

List available boot options.

=> "ok" list default current default and
current are indices into the list and are &minus;1 if unset
or undeterminable.

shutdown (reboot|halt)
[=bootchoice]

(ask|trynow|forcenow|schedule|start

(&minus;1|end (force|forcemy|cancel))) 
Request a system shutdown, either a reboot or a
halt/poweroff.

An OS choice
for the next boot may be specified from the list returned by
"listbootoptions".

Shutdowns
requested from per&minus;display sockets are executed when
the current session on that display exits. Such a request
may pop up a dialog asking for confirmation and/or
authentication.

start is the
time for which the shutdown is scheduled. If it starts with
a plus&minus;sign, the current time is added. Zero means
immediately.

end is the
latest time at which the shutdown should be performed if
active sessions are still running. If it starts with a
plus&minus;sign, the start time is added. Minus one means
wait infinitely. If end is through and active sessions are
still running, KDM can do one of the following:

- "cancel" &minus;
give up the shutdown. 
- "force" &minus; shut down nonetheless. 
- "forcemy" &minus; shut down nonetheless if all
active sessions 
belong to the requesting user. Only for per&minus;display
sockets.

start and end
are specified in seconds since the UNIX epoch.

"trynow"
is a synonym for "0 0 cancel",
"forcenow" for "0 0 force" and
"schedule" for "0 &minus;1".

"ask"
attempts an immediate shutdown and interacts with the user
if active sessions are still running. Only for
per&minus;display sockets.

shutdown cancel
[local|global]

Cancel a scheduled shutdown.
The global socket always cancels the currently pending
shutdown, while per&minus;display sockets default to
cancelling their queued request.

shutdown status

Return a list with information
about shutdowns. 
The entries are comma&minus;separated tuples of:

&minus;
("global"|"local") &minus; pending vs.
queued shutdown. A local 
entry can be returned only by a per&minus;display socket.

&minus; ("halt"|"reboot") 
&minus; start 
&minus; end 
&minus;
("ask"|"force"|"forcemy"|"cancel")

&minus; Numeric user ID of the requesting user, &minus;1 for
the global 
socket. 
&minus; The next boot OS choice or "&minus;" for
none. 
&minus; New fields might be added later.
