NAME
       pnmtorast - convert a PPM into a Sun rasterfile

SYNOPSIS
       pnmtorast [-standard|-rle] [pnmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       pnmtorastreads  a  PPM  image as input and produces a Sun rasterfile as
       output.

       Color values in Sun rasterfiles are eight bits wide, so pnmtorast  will
       automatically  scale colors to have a maxval of 255.  An extra pamdepth
       step is not necessary.

OPTIONS
       In addition to the options common to all programs  based  on  libnetpbm
       (most notably -quiet, see
        Common  Options ⟨index.html#commonoptions⟩ ), pnmtorast recognizes the
       following command line options:

       All options can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.

       -standard

              Forces the result to be in RT_STANDARD form.

       -rle

              Forces the result to be in  RT_BYTE_ENCODED,  which  is  smaller
              but, well, less standard.

              The default is -rle.
