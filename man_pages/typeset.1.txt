NAME

typeset, whence
&minus; shell built-in functions to set/get attributes and
values for shell variables and functions

SYNOPSIS

typeset
[ &plusmn; HLRZfilrtux [n]] [ name [ =
value]]...

whence
[-pv] name...

DESCRIPTION

typeset
sets attributes and values for shell variables and
functions. When typeset is invoked inside a function,
a new instance of the variables name is created. The
variables value and type are restored when the
function completes. The following list of attributes may be
specified:

-H

This flag provides UNIX to host-name file mapping on
non-UNIX machines.

-L

Left justify and remove leading blanks from
value. If n is non-zero it defines the width
of the field; otherwise, it is determined by the width of
the value of first assignment. When the variable is assigned
to, it is filled on the right with blanks or truncated, if
necessary, to fit into the field. Leading zeros are removed
if the -Z flag is also set. The -R flag is
turned off.

-R

Right justify and fill with leading blanks. If n
is non-zero it defines the width of the field, otherwise it
is determined by the width of the value of first assignment.
The field is left filled with blanks or truncated from the
end if the variable is reassigned. The -L flag is
turned off.

-Z

Right justify and fill with leading zeros if the first
non-blank character is a digit and the -L flag has
not been set. If n is non-zero it defines the width
of the field; otherwise, it is determined by the width of
the value of first assignment.

-f

The names refer to function names rather than variable
names. No assignments can be made and the only other valid
flags are -t, -u and -x. The flag
-t turns on execution tracing for this function. The
flag -u causes this function to be marked undefined.
The FPATH variable will be searched to find the
function definition when the function is referenced. The
flag -x allows the function definition to remain in
effect across shell procedures invoked by name.

-i

Parameter is an integer. This makes arithmetic faster.
If n is non-zero it defines the output arithmetic
base; otherwise, the first assignment determines the output
base. 

-l

All upper-case characters are converted to lower-case.
The upper-case flag, -u is turned off.

-r

The given names are marked readonly and
these names cannot be changed by subsequent assignment.

-t

Tags the variables. Tags are user definable and have no
special meaning to the shell.

-u

All lower-case characters are converted to upper-case
characters. The lower-case flag, -l is turned
off. 

-x

The given names are marked for automatic export
to the environment of subsequently-executed
commands. 

The -i
attribute can not be specified along with -R,
-L, -Z, or -f.

Using +
rather than &minus; causes these flags to be turned
off. If no name arguments are given but flags are
specified, a list of names (and optionally the
values) of the variables which have these
flags set is printed. (Using + rather than
&minus; keeps the values from being printed.) If no
names and flags are given, the names and
attributes of all variables are printed.

For each
name, whence indicates how it would be
interpreted if used as a command name.

The -v
flag produces a more verbose report.

The -p
flag does a path search for name even if name is an
alias, a function, or a reserved word.

On this man
page, ksh(1) commands that are preceded by one or two
* (asterisks) are treated specially in the following
ways:

1.

Variable assignment lists
preceding the command remain in effect when the command
completes. 

2.

I/O redirections are processed after variable
assignments. 

3.

Errors cause a script that contains them to abort.

4.

Words, following a command preceded by ** that are in
the format of a variable assignment, are expanded with the
same rules as a variable assignment. This means that tilde
substitution is performed after the = sign and word
splitting and file name generation are not performed.
