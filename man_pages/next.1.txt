NAME

next - show the
next nmh message

SYNOPSIS

next

[-help] [-version]
[+folder] [-showproc program]
[-showmimeproc program] [-header |
-noheader] [-checkmime | -nocheckmime]
[switches for showproc or
showmimeproc] 

DESCRIPTION

next
performs a show on the next message in the specified
(or current) folder. Like show, it passes any
switches on to the program showproc or
showmimeproc, which is called to list the message.
This command is almost exactly equivalent to &ldquo;show
next&rdquo;. Consult the manual entry for show(1)
for all the details.

FILES

$HOME/.mh_profile

The user profile

PROFILE COMPONENTS

nmh directory

DEFAULTS

+folder

The current folder.

-checkmime

-header

CONTEXT

If a folder is specified, it
will become the current folder. The message that is shown
(i.e., the next message in sequence) will become the current
message.

BUGS

next is
really a link to the show program. As a result, if
you make a link to next and that link is not called
next, your link will act like show instead. To
circumvent this, add a profile-entry for the link to your
nmh profile and add the argument next to the
entry.
