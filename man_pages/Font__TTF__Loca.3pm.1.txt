NAME
       Font::TTF::Loca - the Locations table, which is intimately tied to the
       glyf table

DESCRIPTION
       The location table holds the directory of locations of each glyph
       within the glyf table. Due to this relationship and the unimportance of
       the actual locations when it comes to holding glyphs in memory, reading
       the location table results in the creation of glyph objects for each
       glyph and stores them here.  So if you are looking for glyphs, do not
       look in the "glyf" table, look here instead.

       Things get complicated if you try to change the glyph list within the
       one table.  The recommendation is to create another clean location
       object to replace this table in the font, ensuring that the old table
       is read first and to transfer or copy glyphs across from the read table
       to the new table.

INSTANCE VARIABLES
       The instance variables do not start with a space

       glyphs
           An array of glyph objects for each glyph.

       glyphtype
           A string containing the class name to create for each new glyph. If
           empty, defaults to Font::TTF::Glyph.

METHODS
   $t->new
       Creates a new location table making sure it has a glyphs array

   $t->read
       Reads the location table creating glyph objects (Font::TTF::Glyph) for
       each glyph allowing their later reading.

   $t->out($fh)
       Writes the location table out to $fh. Notice that not having read the
       location table implies that the glyf table has not been read either, so
       the numbers in the location table are still valid. Let's hope that
       "maxp/numGlyphs" and "head/indexToLocFmt" haven't changed otherwise we
       are in big trouble.

       The function uses the OUTLOC location in the glyph calculated when the
       glyf table was attempted to be output.

   $t->out_xml($context, $depth)
       No need to output a loca table, this is dynamically generated

   $t->glyphs_do(&func)
       Calls func for each glyph in this location table in numerical order:

           &func($glyph, $glyph_num)

       None known
