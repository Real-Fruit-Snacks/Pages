NAME
       rar - archive files with compression

SYNOPSIS
       rar  <command>  [-<switch  1>  -<switch  N>] archive [files...] [@list-
       files...] [path_to_extract]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the rar archiver.
       This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution  be-
       cause the original program does not have a manual page.
       Commands and options described here are as of rar 6.11.

       rar is a program for creating and manipulating .rar archives.

COMMANDS
       After  the program name comes a command and then optional switches with
       dashes before them.
       A summary of commands is included below.  For a  complete  description,
       run rar -?

       a      Add files to archive.

       c      Add archive comment. Comment length is limited to 256 KB.

       ch     Change  archive  parameters.   Can  be used with most of archive
              modification options.

       cw     Write archive comment to a specified file.

       d      Delete files from archive.

       e      Extract files to current directory. Does not create  any  subdi-
              rectories.

       f      Freshen  files  in  archive.   Updates those files changed since
              they were packed to the archive.  This command will not add  new
              to the archive.

       k      Lock  archive.   Any  command which intend to change the archive
              will be ignored.

       l[t[a],b]
              List content of archive [technical[all], bare].
               'lt' displays the detailed file information in multiline  mode.
              Commands  'lt', 'lta' and 'lb' are equal to 'vt', 'vta' and 'vb'
              correspondingly.

       m[f]   Move to archive [files only].  Directories will not  be  removed
              if 'f' modifier is used and/or '-ed' switch is applied.

       p      Print file to stdout.

       r      Repair archive. For further details look in rar.txt.

       rc     Reconstruct missing volumes using recovery volumes (.rev files).
              You need to specify any existing volume as the archive name, for
              example, 'rar rc backup.part03.rar'.

       rn     Rename archived files.

       rr[N]  Add data recovery record. Optionally, redundant information (re-
              covery record) may be added to an archive.

       rv[N]  Create recovery volumes (.rev files), which can be later used to
              reconstruct  missing  files  in  a volume set.  This command has
              sense only for multivolume archives.  For further  details  look
              in rar.txt.

       s[name|-]
              Convert  archive to or from SFX. The archive is merged with SFX-
              module in the user's home directory.

       t      Test archive files.

       u      Update files in archive. Adds files not already in  the  archive
              and updates files changed since they were packed to the archive.

       v[t[a],b]
              Verbosely list archive [technical]

       x      Extract files with full path.

OPTIONS
       NOTE:  Every  switch must be separated by a whitespace.  They cannot be
       put together.

       -?     Display help on commands and switches. The same as when none  or
              an illegal command line option is entered.

       --     This  switch  tells to RAR that there is no more switches in the
              command line. It could be useful, if either archive or file name
              starts  from  '-' character. Without '--' switch such name would
              be treated as switch.

       -@[+]  Disable [enable] file lists.

       -ad[1,2]
              Alternate destination path.

       -ag[format]
              Generate archive name using the current date and time.   Appends
              the  current date string to an archive name when creating an ar-
              chive. Useful for daily backups.  For further  details  look  in
              rar.txt.

       -ai    Ignore file attributes.

       -ap<path>
              Set  path inside archive. This path is merged to file names when
              adding files to an archive and removed from file names when  ex-
              tracting.

       -as    Synchronize archive contents.
              If  this  switch  is  used  when archiving, those archived files
              which are not present in the list of the currently added  files,
              will  be  deleted  from  archive.  It  is convenient to use this
              switch in combination with -u (update) to  synchronize  contents
              of an archive and an archiving directory.

       -cfg-  Disable reading configuration and environment.

       -cl    Convert file names to lower case.

       -cu    Convert file names to upper case.

       -c-    Disable showing comments.

       -df    Delete  files  after  archiving. This switch in combination with
              the command "a" performs the same action as the command "m".

       -dh    Open shared files.  Allows one to process files opened by  other
              applications for writing.

       -ds    Do not sort files while adding to a solid archive.

       -dw    Wipe files after archiving.

       -ed    Do not add empty directories.

       -ep    Exclude paths from names.

       -ep1   Exclude base dir from names.

       -ep2   Expand paths to full. Store full file paths (except a drive let-
              ter and leading path separator) when archiving.

       -ep4<path>
              Exclude the path prefix from names.

       -e[+]<attr>
              Set file exclude [or include] attributes.

       -f     Freshen files. May be used with archive extraction or creation.

       -hp[password]
              Encrypt both file data and headers.  The password is case-sensi-
              tive.  If you omit the password on the command line, you will be
              prompted with message "Enter password".

       -ht[b|c]
              Select hash type [BLAKE2,CRC32] for file checksum.

       -id[c,d,n,p,q]
              Display or disable messages.

       -ierr  Send all messages to stderr.

       -ilog[name]
              Log errors to file.

       -inul  Disable all messages.

       -isnd[-]
              Control notification sounds.

       -iver  Display the version number

       -k     Lock archive.
              Any command which intends to change the archive will be ignored.

       -kb    Keep broken extracted files.

       -log[f][=name]
              Write names to log file.

       -m<0..5>
              Set compression level (0-store...3-default...5-best). By default
              rar uses -m3 method (Normal compression).

       -ma[4|5]
              Specify a version of archiving format.

       -mc<par>
              Set  advanced  compression parameters.  For further details look
              in rar.txt.

       -md<size>[k,m,g]
              Set dictionary size in KB, MB or GB.

       -me[par]
              Set encryption parameters.

              Specify file types (extensions) to store.

       -mt<threads>
              Set the number of threads.
              If this switch is not specified, RAR will try to detect the num-
              ber  of  available  processors and selects the optimal number of
              threads automatically.

       -n<file>
              Additionally filter included files.

       -n@    Read additional filter masks from stdin.

       -n@<list>
              Read additional filter masks from list file.

       -o+    Overwrite existing files.

       -o-    Do not overwrite existing files.

       -oh    Save hard links as the link instead of the file.

       -oi[0-4][:min]
              Save identical files as references.

       -ol[a] Process symbolic links as the link [absolute paths].

       -ow    Save or restore file owner and group.

       -p[password]
              Encrypt files with the given string as password while archiving.
              The  password is case-sensitive. If you omit the password on the
              command line, you will be prompted  with  message  "Enter  pass-
              word".

       -qo[-|+]
              Add quick open information [none|force].

       -r     Recurse subdirectories.

       -r-    Disable recursion.

       -r0    Similar  to  -r,  but when used with the commands 'a', 'u', 'f',
              'm' will recurse subdirectories only for wildcard names.

       -rr[N] Add data recovery record.

       -rv[N] Create recovery volumes.  -s Create solid archive.

       -s<N>  Create solid groups using file count. Similar to -s,  but  reset
              solid statistics after compressing <N> files.

       -se    Create  solid  groups  using extension. Similar to -s, but reset
              solid statistics if file extension is changed.

       -sv    Create independent solid volumes. Similar to -s, but reset solid
              statistics as soon as possible when starting a new volume.

       -sv-   Create  dependent  solid  volumes.  Similar  to -s, but reset of
              solid statistics is disabled.

       -s-    Disable solid archiving.

       -sc<chr>[obj]
              Specify the character set.

       -sfx[name]
              Create SFX archives.  The  archive  is  merged  with  SFX-module
              "name"  in  the  user's  home  directory.  The default module is
              taken from /usr/lib/default.sfx.

              Process files with size less than specified.

       -sm<size>
              Process files with size more than specified.

       -t     Test files after archiving. This switch is especially useful  in
              combination with the move command, so files will be deleted only
              if the archive has been successfully tested.

       -ta[mcao]<d>
              Process files modified after <d> YYYYMMDDHHMMSS date.

       -tb[mcao]<d>
              Process files modified before <d> YYYYMMDDHHMMSS date.

       -tk    Keep original archive time. Prevents rar from modifying the  ar-
              chive date when changing an archive.

       -tl    Set archive time to latest file. Forces rar to set the date of a
              changed archive to the date of the newest file in the archive.

       -tn[mcao]<t>
              Process files newer than <t> time.

       -to[mcao]<t>
              Process files older than <t> time.

       -ts[m,c,a,p]
              Save or restore time (modification, creation, access, preserve).

       -u     Update files.

       -v<size>[k|b]
              Create volumes with size=<size>*1000 [*1024, *1] bytes.

       -ver[n]
              File version control.

       -vn    Use the old style volume naming scheme.

       -vp    Pause before each volume.

       -w<path>
              Assign work directory.

       -x<file>
              Exclude specified file. Wildcards may be used and you may  spec-
              ify the switch '-x' several times.

       -x@<list>
              Exclude files in specified list file.

       -x@    Read file names to exclude from stdin.

       -y     Assume Yes on all queries.

       -z[file]
              Read  archive comment from file.  If [file] is not present, com-
              ment is read from stdin.
