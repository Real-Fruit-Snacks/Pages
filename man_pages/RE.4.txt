NAME

re &mdash; RealTek
8139C+/8169/816xS/811xS/8168/810xE/8111 PCI/PCIe Ethernet
adapter driver

SYNOPSIS

To compile this driver into the
kernel, place the following lines in your kernel
configuration file:

device
miibus 
device re

Alternatively,
to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following line in loader.conf(5):

if_re_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION

The re driver provides
support for various NICs based on the RealTek RTL8139C+,
RTL8169, RTL816xS, RTL811xS, RTL8168, RTL810xE and RTL8111
PCI and PCIe Ethernet controllers.

NICs based on
the 8139C+ and 810xE are capable of 10 and 100Mbps speeds
over CAT5 cable. NICs based on the 8169, 816xS, 811xS, 8168
and 8111 are capable of 10, 100 and 1000Mbps operation.

All NICs
supported by the re driver have TCP/IP checksum
offload and hardware VLAN tagging/insertion features, and
use a descriptor-based DMA mechanism. They are also capable
of TCP large send (TCP segmentation offload).

The 8139C+ is a
single-chip solution combining both a 10/100 MAC and PHY.
The 8169 is a 10/100/1000 MAC only, requiring a GMII or TBI
external PHY. The 816xS, 811xS, 8168 and 8111 are
single-chip devices containing both a 10/100/1000 MAC and
10/100/1000 copper PHY. Standalone 10/100/1000 cards are
available in both 32-bit PCI and 64-bit PCI models. The
8110S is designed for embedded LAN-on-motherboard
applications.

The 8169, 8169S
and 8110S also support jumbo frames, which can be configured
via the interface MTU setting. The MTU is limited to 7422,
since the chip cannot transmit larger frames. Selecting an
MTU larger than 1500 bytes with the ifconfig(8) utility
configures the adapter to receive and transmit jumbo
frames.

The re
driver supports the following media types:

autoselect

Enable
autoselection of the media type and options. The user can
manually override the autoselected mode by adding media
options to rc.conf(5).

10baseT/UTP

Set 10Mbps
operation. The ifconfig(8) mediaopt option can also
be used to select either full-duplex or
half-duplex modes.

100baseTX

Set 100Mbps
(Fast Ethernet) operation. The ifconfig(8) mediaopt
option can also be used to select either full-duplex
or half-duplex modes.

1000baseTX

Set 1000baseTX
operation over twisted pair. The RealTek gigE chips support
1000Mbps in full-duplex mode only.

The re
driver supports the following media options:

full-duplex

Force full
duplex operation.

half-duplex

Force half
duplex operation.

For more
information on configuring this device, see ifconfig(8).

LOADER TUNABLES

Tunables can be set at the
loader(8) prompt before booting the kernel or stored in
loader.conf(5).

hw.re.intr_filter

This tunable makes driver use
interrupt filter handler on controllers that support
MSI/MSI-X capability. If MSI/MSI-X is disabled by
administrator this tunable has no effect and driver will use
interrupt filter handler. The default value is 0 to use
interrupt thread handler.

hw.re.msi_disable

This tunable disables MSI
support on the Ethernet hardware. The default value is
0.

hw.re.msix_disable

This tunable disables MSI-X
support on the Ethernet hardware. The default value is
0.

hw.re.prefer_iomap

This tunable controls which
register mapping should be used on the specified device. A
non-zero value enables I/O space register mapping. The
default value is 0 to use memory space register mapping.

SYSCTL VARIABLES

The following variables are
available as both sysctl(8) variables and loader(8)
tunables:

dev.re.%d.int_rx_mod

Maximum amount of time to delay
receive interrupt processing in units of 1us. The accepted
range is 0 to 65, the default is 65(65us). Value 0
completely disables the interrupt moderation. The interface
need to be brought down and up again before a change takes
effect.

DIAGNOSTICS

re%d: couldn&rsquo;t map
memory  A fatal initialization error has
occurred.

re%d:
couldn&rsquo;t map ports  A fatal initialization
error has occurred.

re%d:
couldn&rsquo;t map interrupt  A fatal
initialization error has occurred.

re%d: no
memory for softc struct!  The driver failed to
allocate memory for per-device instance information during
initialization.

re%d: failed
to enable memory mapping!  The driver failed to
initialize PCI shared memory mapping. This might happen if
the card is not in a bus-master slot.

re%d: no
memory for jumbo buffers!  The driver failed to
allocate memory for jumbo frames during initialization.

re%d:
watchdog timeout  The device has stopped responding
to the network, or there is a problem with the network
connection (cable).

BUGS

The Xterasys XN-152 32-bit PCI
NIC, which uses the RTL8169 MAC and Marvell 88E1000 PHY, has
a defect that causes DMA corruption if the board is plugged
into a 64-bit PCI slot. The defect lies in the board design,
not the chip itself: the PCI REQ64# and ACK64# lines should
be pulled high, but they are not. The result is that the
8169 chip is tricked into performing 64-bit DMA transfers
even though a 64-bit data path between the NIC and the bus
does not actually exist.

Unfortunately,
it is not possible to correct this problem in software,
however it is possible to detect it. When the re
driver is loaded, it will run a diagnostic routine designed
to validate DMA operation by placing the chip in digital
loopback mode and initiating a packet transmission. If the
card functions properly, the transmitted data will be echoed
back unmodified. If the echoed data is corrupt, the driver
will print an error message on the console and abort the
device attach. The user should ensure the NIC is installed
in a 32-bit PCI slot to avoid this problem.

The RealTek
8169, 8169S and 8110S chips appear to only be capable of
transmitting jumbo frames up to 7.5K in size.
