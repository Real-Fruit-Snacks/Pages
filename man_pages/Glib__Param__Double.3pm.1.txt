DESCRIPTION
       This page documents the extra accessors available for both of the
       floating-point type paramspecs: Float and Double.  Perl really only
       supports doubles, so all of these methods return NVs (that is, the C
       type "double"); the distinction of size is important to the underlying
       C library and also determines the data value range.
