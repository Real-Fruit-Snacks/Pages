DESCRIPTION

atmsigd
implements the ATM UNI signaling protocol. Requests to
establish, accept, or close ATM SVCs are sent from the
kernel (using a comparably simple protocol) to the signaling
demon, which then performs the dialog with the network.

Note that
atmsigd is not able to accept or establish
connections until the local ATM address of the interface is
configured by ilmid or manually using
atmaddr.

The default
signaling VC (interface 0, VPI 0, VCI 5) can be overridden
on the command line by specifying a different PVC
address.

When overriding
the default VC, optionally a pair of named pipes to use for
communicating with the user of signaling can be specified.
Normally, the kernel is the user of signaling and
atmsigd opens a special socket for communication with
it.

If
atmsigd is killed, all system calls requiring
interaction with it will return with an error and set
errno to EUNATCH.

OPTIONS

-b

Run in background (i.e. in a
forked child process) after initializing.

-c config_file

Use the specified configuration
file instead of /etc/atmsigd.conf If an option is
specified in the configuration file and on the command line,
the command line has priority.

-d

Enables (lots of) debugging output. By default,
atmsigd is comparably quiet.

-D dump_dir

Specifies the directory to
which atmsigd will write status and trace dumps. If
-D is not specified, dumps are written to
/var/tmp.

-l logfile

Write diagnostic messages to
the specified file. The special name syslog is used
to send diagnostics to the system logger, stderr is
used to send diagnostics to standard error. If -l is
absent, the setting in atmsigd.conf is used. If
atmsigd doesnâ€™t specify a destination either,
messages are written to standard error.

-m mode

Set the mode of operation. The
following modes are available: user for the user side
(the default), network for the network side (useful
if you have two PCs but no switch), and switch for
operation with a signaling relay in a switch.

-n

Prints addresses in numeric format only, i.e. no address
to name translation is attempted.

-q qos

Configures the signaling VC to use the specified quality
of service (see qos(7) for the syntax). By default, UBR at
link speed is used on the signaling VC.

-t trace_length

Sets the number of entries that
should be kept in the trace buffer. -t 0 disables
tracing. If -t is not specified, atmsigd uses
a default of 20 trace entries.

-u uni_version

Sets the signaling mode. The
following modes are supported: uni30 for UNI 3.0,
uni31 for UNI 3.1, uni31+uni30 for UNI 3.1
with 3.0 compatibility, uni40 for UNI 4.0, and
uni40+q.2963.1 for UNI 4.0 with Q.2963.1 peak cell
rate renegotiation.

-V

Prints the version number of atmsigd on standard
output and exits.

FILES

/etc/atmsigd.conf

default configuration file

/var/tmp/atmsigd.pid.status.version

default location of status
dumps

/var/tmp/atmsigd.pid.trace.version

default location of signaling
trace dumps

DEBUGGING

When receiving
a SIGUSR1 signal, atmsigd dumps the list of
all internal socket descriptors. With SIGUSR2, it
dumps the contents of the trace buffer. If a dump directory
was set, dumps are written to files called
atmsigd.pid.status.number and
atmsigd.pid.trace.number,
respectively, with number starting at zero and being
incremented for every dump. If no dump directory is set,
dumps are written to standard error.

Dumps are also
generated whenever atmsigd detects a fatal error and
terminates. No attempt is made to catch signals like
SIGSEGV.

BUGS

The generation
of traces is a comparably slow process which may already
take several seconds for only 100 trace entries. To generate
a trace dump, atmsigd therefore forks a child process
that runs in parallel to the signaling demon.
