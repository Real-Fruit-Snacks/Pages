KVM_GETERR(3) BSD Library Functions Manual
KVM_GETERR(3)

NAME

kvm_geterr â€” get
error message on kvm descriptor

SYNOPSIS

#include

char
*

kvm_geterr(kvm_t *kd);

DESCRIPTION

This function returns a string
describing the most recent error condition on the descriptor
kd. The results are undefined if the most recent
kvm(3) library call did not produce an error. The string
returned is stored in memory owned by kvm(3) so the message
should be copied out and saved elsewhere if necessary.

BUGS

This routine cannot be used to
access error conditions due to a failed
kvm_openfiles() call, since failure is indicated by
returning a NULL descriptor. Therefore, errors on open are
output to the special error buffer passed to
kvm_openfiles(). This option is not available to
kvm_open().
