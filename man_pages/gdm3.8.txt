NAME

gdm3 - GNOME
Display Manager

SYNOPSIS

gdm3

DESCRIPTION

gdm3 is
the equivalent of xdm(1x) or wdm(1x), but uses
the GNOME libraries to provide a GNOME look-and-feel. It
provides the GNOME equivalent of a "login:"
prompt.

gdm3
reads /etc/gdm3/daemon.conf for its configuration.
For each local display, gdm starts an X server and runs a
minimal GNOME session including a graphical greeter. If
configured so, the main gdm process also listens for XDMCP
requests from remote displays. These requests can either be
direct, causing gdm3 to start a session on the remote
display, or indirect, causing a chooser to be opened.

When managing a
display, gdm3 attempts to execute
/etc/gdm3/Init/display, or
/etc/gdm3/Init/Default if that does not exist. When a
user logs in, gdm3 first attempts
/etc/gdm3/PreSession/display (or
/etc/gdm3/PreSession/Default), and then one of the
sessions defined in /usr/share/xsessions. When the
session has completed, gdm attempts to run
/etc/gdm3/PostSession/display, or
/etc/gdm3/PostSession/Default.

gdm3
maintains information about the displays it is managing in
/var/lib/gdm3. This includes xauth information, so
this directory is not readable to normal users.

gdm3
uses PAM to perform authentication using the config file
/etc/pam.d/gdm3.

ENVIRONMENT

XAUTHORITY

Upon session startup, GDM sets
the XAUTHORITY environment variable to a session-specific
file in /run/gdm3.

Applications
and scripts that assume this file is set to
~/.Xauthority will not work. To access the display
you need both DISPLAY and XAUTHORITY variables.
