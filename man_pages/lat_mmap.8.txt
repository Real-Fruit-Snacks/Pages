NAME

lat_mmap -
costs of mmapping and unmmapping varying file sizes

SYNOPSIS

lat_mmap
[ -P  ] [ -W
 ] [ -N  ]
size file

DESCRIPTION

lat_mmap
times how fast a mapping can be made and unmade. This is
useful because it is a fundamental part of processes that
use SunOS style shared libraries (the libraries are mapped
in at process start up time and unmapped at process
exit).

The benchmark
maps in and unmaps the first size bytes of the file
repeatedly and reports the average time for one
mapping/unmapping.

The size
specification may end with ’’k’’ or
’’m’’ to mean kilobytes (* 1024) or
megabytes (* 1024 * 1024).

OUTPUT

Output format
is "%0.2f %d\n", megabytes, usecs,
i.e.,

8.00
1200
