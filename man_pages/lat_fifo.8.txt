SYNOPSIS

lat_ctx

DESCRIPTION

lat_fifo
is a client/server program that measures interprocess
communication latencies. The benchmark passes a message back
and forth between the two processes (this sort of benchmark
is frequently referred to as a ’’hot
potato’’ benchmark). No other work is done in
the processes. The message is passed back and forth using
FIFOs.
