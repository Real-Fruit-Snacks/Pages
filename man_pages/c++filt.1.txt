NAME

c −
genericised soft drink generator (ie coffee, coke etc)

SYNOPSIS

c
[-s[number]] [-m[type]] [-e] [-i] [-T] [-S amount]
[--other=drink]

DESCRIPTION

This manual
page documents the GNU version of c. c is a
genericised soft drinks engine designed to provide a stream
of the desired beverage on the standard output. By default,
c makes coffee, white, no sugar. This is a historical choice
based on the authors preferences. This behaviour is
controlled by the options, and a wide range of other drinks
are possible. Please note that not all combinations make
sense, in taste terms, but that parsing by c extends only to
syntax. Experiment at your own risk.

OPTIONS

−s[number]

Specifies the number of sugars
desired. If this option is omitted, none will be
included.

Excessively
large values will result in unpleasant side effects,
including rotting teeth and excess weight.

If this option
is specified with no parameter, the default is one.

−m[type]

Determines whether milk will be
used or not. The default corresponds to the specification
’cold’. cold - Normal, cold milk

hot
Normal, hot milk

frth
Frothed milk (see -e option for cappucino)

none No
milk. Recommended for those who have a deadline.

goat Use
your imagination.

−e

Espresso option. High pressure steam is forced through
fine ground dark beans for a stronger brew; careful use of
the -S option is advised to avoid shaky hands and heart
palpitations (see BUGS).

−i

Iced coffee. Self explanatory really...

−T

Turkish coffee. The only type of coffee that is boiled
deliberately. -s2 or more recommended to avoid grimaces.

−S[amount]

Size of the virtual
’mug’ to be filled. The scale used is fairly
arbitrary, but should cover most cases... 1
thimbleful

2
espresso cup

3
cafe-style coffee cup

4 office
mug

5
sysadmin mug

6
bucket

Use of -S 6 is
contraindicated for use with n(1), due to possible damage to
t he nasal membranes, and risk of drowning. The default is
4; unless a beta version of the OS is installed, when the
default is 5. If the beta is of Digital UNIX, 6 is the
default; you’ll need it.

−-other=drink

Specify a drink other than
coffee. Use of other options is not recommended; the
behaviour is unspecified!

BUGS

Caffeine
overdose can result by inadvised combinations of options (ie
-e and large values for -S). If you suffer from increased
heart rate, visual disturbance, shaking hands, shortness of
breath, it is suggested that you discontinue use. A -d
(decaf) option was included in previous versions, but was
removed after a threatened litigation arising from an
unfortunate practical joke involving misuse.
