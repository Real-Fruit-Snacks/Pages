NAME

bw_mmap_rd -
time the reading and summing of a file

SYNOPSIS

bw_mmap_rd
[ -P  ] [ -W
 ] [ -N  ]
size file

DESCRIPTION

bw_mmap_rd
creates a memory mapping to the file and then reads the
mapping in an unrolled loop similar to that used in
bw_mem_rd(8). The benchmark is intended to be used on a file
that is in memory, i.e., the benchmark is a reread
benchmark. Other file benchmarking can be done with
lmdd(8).

The size
specification may end with ’’k’’ or
’’m’’ to mean kilobytes (* 1024) or
megabytes (* 1024 * 1024).

OUTPUT

Output format
is "%0.2f %.2f\n", megabytes,
megabytes_per_second, i.e.,

8.00
25.33

MEMORY UTILIZATION

This benchmark
should move approximately the reported amount of memory.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

Funding for the
development of this tool was provided by Sun Microsystems
Computer Corporation.
