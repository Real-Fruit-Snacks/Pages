NAME

cc_hd &mdash; HD
Congestion Control Algorithm

DESCRIPTION

The HD congestion control
algorithm is an implementation of the Hamilton
Institute&rsquo;s delay-based congestion control which aims
to keep network queuing delays below a particular threshold
(queue_threshold).

HD
probabilistically reduces the congestion window (cwnd) based
on its estimate of the network queuing delay. The
probability of reducing cwnd is zero at hd_qmin or less,
rising to a maximum at queue_threshold, and then back to
zero at the maximum queuing delay.

Loss-based
congestion control algorithms such as NewReno probe for
network capacity by filling queues until there is a packet
loss. HD competes with loss-based congestion control
algorithms by allowing its probability of reducing cwnd to
drop from a maximum at queue_threshold to be zero at the
maximum queuing delay. This has been shown to work well when
the bottleneck link is highly multiplexed.

MIB Variables

The algorithm exposes the
following tunable variables in the net.inet.tcp.cc.hd
branch of the sysctl(3) MIB:

queue_threshold

Queueing
congestion threshold (qth) in ticks. Default is 20.

pmax

Per packet
maximum backoff probability as a percentage. Default is
5.

qmin

Minimum queuing
delay threshold (qmin) in ticks. Default is 5.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Development and testing of this
software were made possible in part by grants from the
FreeBSD Foundation and Cisco University Research Program
Fund at Community Foundation Silicon Valley.

FUTURE WORK

The Hamilton Institute have
recently made some improvements to the algorithm implemented
by this module and have called it Coexistent-TCP (C-TCP).
The improvements should be evaluated and potentially
incorporated into this module.

HISTORY

The cc_hd congestion
control module first appeared in FreeBSD 9.0.

The module was
first released in 2010 by David Hayes whilst working on the
NewTCP research project at Swinburne University of
Technology&rsquo;s Centre for Advanced Internet
Architectures, Melbourne, Australia. More details are
available at:
