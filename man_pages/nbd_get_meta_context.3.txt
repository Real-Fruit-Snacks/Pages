NAME

nbd_get_meta_context
- return the i&rsquo;th meta context request

SYNOPSIS

#include

char * nbd_get_meta_context ( 
struct nbd_handle *h, size_t i 
);

DESCRIPTION

During
connection libnbd can negotiate zero or more metadata
contexts with the server. Metadata contexts are features
(such as "base:allocation") which describe
information returned by the nbd_block_status_64(3)
command (for "base:allocation" this is whether
blocks of data are allocated, zero or sparse).

This command
returns the i&rsquo;th meta context request, as added by
nbd_add_meta_context(3), and bounded by
nbd_get_nr_meta_contexts(3).

RETURN VALUE

This call
returns a string. The caller must free the returned string
to avoid a memory leak.

ERRORS

On error
"NULL" is returned.

Refer to
"ERROR HANDLING" in libnbd(3) for how to
get further details of the error.

The following
parameters must not be NULL: "h". For more
information see "Non-NULL parameters" in
libnbd(3).

VERSION

This function
first appeared in libnbd 1.6.

If you need to
test if this function is available at compile time check if
the following macro is defined:

#define
LIBNBD_HAVE_NBD_GET_META_CONTEXT 1
