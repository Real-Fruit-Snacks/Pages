NAME

volmissing
&minus; notify user that volume requested is not in the
CD-ROM or floppy drive

SYNOPSIS

/usr/lib/vold/volmissing
[-c] [-p] [-s]
[-m alias]

DESCRIPTION

volmissing
informs a user when a requested volume is not available.
Depending on the option selected, users are notified through
their console window, syslogd(1M), or a mail
message.

volmissing
-p is the default action taken by vold(1M),
the Volume Management daemon, when it needs to notify a user
that the requested volume is not available. If you want to
change this default event, modify the /etc/vold.conf
file. See vold.conf(4).

You can change
the notification method for your system by editing the
vold.conf configuration file and providing a new
option for volmissing in the notify entry under the
Events category.

OPTIONS

-c

Send a message to the
user&rsquo;s console requesting the volume be inserted. To
end the notification without inserting the requested volume,
use volcancel(1).

-p

All volmissing events will be handled through a
GUI, provided a window system is running on the console. If
this option is specified, and no window system is running,
all messages go to the system console.

-s

Send one message to the syslogd(1M).

-m alias

Send a mail message to the
specified mail alias about the missing volume.

FILES

/etc/vold.conf

Volume Management daemon
configuration file. Directs the Volume Management daemon to
control certain devices, and causes action to be taken when
specific criteria is met.

/usr/lib/vold/volmissing_popup

Pop-up used when the -p
option is supplied and a window system is running.
