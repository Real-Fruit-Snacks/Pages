NAME

update&minus;fonts&minus;scale
&minus; generate fonts.scale files

SYNOPSIS

update&minus;fonts&minus;scale
[OPTION] directory ...

DESCRIPTION

update&minus;fonts&minus;scale
assembles a fonts.scale file in an X font directory
using one or more scale files found in a subdirectory of
/etc/X11/fonts/. It is typically invoked only from
the post&minus;installation and post&minus;removal scripts
of a package containing scalable fonts usable by the X
Window System whose X LFD font names are not in the font
files themselves, but may be invoked at any time to
reconstruct fonts.scale files. For each
directory, which is either an absolute path to an X
font directory or (preferably) simply the last component of
its path (such as &rsquo;75dpi&rsquo; or
&rsquo;misc&rsquo;), update&minus;fonts&minus;scale
will assemble either
/usr/lib/X11/fonts/directory/fonts.scale or
/usr/share/fonts/X11/directory/fonts.scale
from the index files found at
/etc/X11/fonts/directory/package.scale,
where package is the name of the package installing
the fonts.

This enables
multiple packages to provide names for fonts in the same
directory. No font package actually provides the
fonts.scale file in the X font directory itself, so
there is no danger of overwriting one package&rsquo;s font
names with those of another.

For instance,
the two packages &rsquo;xfonts&minus;scalable&rsquo; (real)
and &rsquo;xfonts&minus;nifty&rsquo; (hypothetical) may both
install fonts into the directory
/usr/lib/X11/fonts/Type1. They each place their
fonts.scale files in
/etc/X11/fonts/Type1/xfonts&minus;scalable.scale and
/etc/X11/fonts/Type1/xfonts&minus;nifty.scale
(respectively). update&minus;fonts&minus;scale
concatenates these two files (as well as any others that
match /etc/X11/fonts/Type1/*.scale) into
/usr/lib/X11/fonts/Type1/fonts.scale.

The format for
fonts.scale files is given in the
mkfontdir(1x) manual page.

An example of
how to use update&minus;fonts&minus;scale in package
maintainer scripts is provided in the Debian Policy
Manual.

OPTIONS

&minus;h,
&minus;&minus;help displays a brief usage message and
exits.

OPERANDS

update&minus;fonts&minus;scale
takes one or more X font directory names to operate on as
operands. Only the final path component of the directory
name should be specified; e.g.,

update&minus;fonts&minus;scale
75dpi

is correct, while
&rsquo;update&minus;fonts&minus;scale
/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi&rsquo; and
&rsquo;update&minus;fonts&minus;scale
/usr/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi&rsquo; are not.

ENVIRONMENT

COLUMNS

indicates the width of the
terminal device in character cells. This value is used for
formatting diagnostic messages. If not set, the terminal is
queried using stty(1) to determine its width. If that
fails, a value of &rsquo;80&rsquo; is assumed.

DEBUG

determines whether low&minus;level diagnostic messages
are issued to standard error output. A null (empty) or unset
value indicates that they are not, and a non&minus;null
value indicates that they are.

DIAGNOSTICS

Errors 
usage error: one or more font directories must be
provided

update&minus;fonts&minus;scale
was invoked without operands. Supply one or more X font
directory names to operate on.

usage error: unrecognized
option

update&minus;fonts&minus;scale
was invoked with an unrecognized option argument. Use only
the options documented in &ldquo;OPTIONS&rdquo;, above.

fatal error: path to X font
directory must be used

A directory name was supplied
that was not an X font directory name. Supply X font
directory names only.

Warnings

warning: absolute path directory was
provided

Usage of absolute paths is
deprecated. Use only the final component of the X font
directory name for directory.

warning:
directory does not exist or is not a
directory

The supplied directory
was invalid. update&minus;fonts&minus;scale skipped
it.

Notes

Notes are only displayed under special circumstances; see
&ldquo;ENVIRONMENT&rdquo;. above. 
note: index references nonexistent font
file filename

The index file
/etc/X11/fonts/directory/package.scale,
refers to a nonexistent font file, filename. This is
normal when package has been removed, but not purged
from the system. In other circumstances, it likely indicates
an error in package.

EXIT STATUS

0

update&minus;fonts&minus;scale
ran successfully.

1

update&minus;fonts&minus;scale experienced a
fatal error; see the section on diagnostic messages
above. 

2

update&minus;fonts&minus;scale was invoked with
invalid arguments.
