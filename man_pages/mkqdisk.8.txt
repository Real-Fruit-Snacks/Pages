NAME

mkqdisk &minus;
Cluster Quorum Disk Utility

WARNING

Use of this
command can cause the cluster to malfunction.

SYNOPSIS

mkqdisk
[&minus;?|&minus;h] | [&minus;L] | [&minus;f label]
[&minus;c device -l label] [-d [-d
...]]

DESCRIPTION

The
mkqdisk command is used to create a new quorum disk
or display existing quorum disks accessible from a given
cluster node.

OPTIONS

&minus;c device
&minus;l label

Initialize a new cluster quorum
disk. This will destroy all data on the given device. If a
cluster is currently using that device as a quorum disk, the
entire cluster will malfunction. Do not run this on an
active cluster when qdiskd is running. Only one device on
the SAN should ever have the given label; using multiple
different devices is currently not supported (it is expected
a RAID array is used for quorum disk redundancy). The label
can be any textual string up to 127 characters - and is
therefore enough space to hold a UUID created with
uuidgen(1).

&minus;f label

Find the cluster quorum disk
with the given label and display information about it.

&minus;L

Display information on all accessible cluster quorum
disks. 

&minus;d

Increase debugging level. Specify multiple times for
more information. Currently, specifying more than twice has
no effect.
