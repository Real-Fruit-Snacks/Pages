WHOIS.CONF(5)                  Debian GNU/Linux                  WHOIS.CONF(5)

NAME
       whois.conf - alternative WHOIS servers list for whois client

SYNOPSIS
       /etc/whois.conf

DESCRIPTION
       This  file  contains a list of WHOIS servers which can augment or over‐
       ride the built-in list of the client.

       It's a plain text file in ASCII encoding. Each  line  consists  of  two
       fields:  a pattern to match WHOIS object identifier and a corresponding
       WHOIS server domain name.

       Fields are separated by non-empty sequence of space or a tabular  char‐
       acters.   A  line  starting with a hash character is a free comment and
       it's not considered.

       The pattern is case-insensitive extended regular  expression  if  whois
       client has been compiled with POSIX regular expressions support. Other‐
       wise, simple case-insensitive suffix comparison  against  WHOIS  object
       identifier is used.

       Internationalized domain names (IDN) must be specified in ascii-compat‐
       ible encoding (ACE) format.
