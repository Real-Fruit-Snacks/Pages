NAME

curl_mime_name
- set a mime part&rsquo;s name

SYNOPSIS

#include

CURLcode
curl_mime_name(curl_mimepart * part, const
char * name);

DESCRIPTION

curl_mime_name(3)
sets a mime part&rsquo;s name. This is the way HTTP form
fields are named.

part is
the part&rsquo;s handle to assign a name to.

name
points to the null-terminated name string.

The name string
is copied into the part, thus the associated storage may
safely be released or reused after call. Setting a
part&rsquo;s name twice is valid: only the value set by the
last call is retained. It is possible to "unname"
a part by setting name to NULL.

AVAILABILITY

As long as at
least one of HTTP, SMTP or IMAP is enabled. Added in
7.56.0.

RETURN VALUE

CURLE_OK or a
CURL error code upon failure.

EXAMPLE

curl_mime
*mime; 
curl_mimepart *part;

/* create a
mime handle */ 
mime = curl_mime_init(easy);

/* add a part
*/ 
part = curl_mime_addpart(mime);

/* give the
part a name */ 
curl_mime_name(part, "shoe_size");
