VIS-COMPLETE(1) BSD General Commands Manual
VIS-COMPLETE(1)

NAME

vis-complete &mdash;
Interactively complete file or word

SYNOPSIS

vis-complete
[--file | --word] [--]
pattern

vis-complete
-h | --help

DESCRIPTION

vis-complete takes a
pattern on the command-line and completes file or word and
displays them in a menu for the user to select one. Once the
user has selected a completion, the completion (excluding
the pattern) is printed to standard output.

vis-complete
uses vis-menu(1) as its user-interface, so see that page for
more details.

--file

This passes pattern to
find to obtain a list of matching file names (this is
the default).

--word

This reads standard input to
obtain a list of lines matching pattern.

--

An argument
following this token will be treated as pattern, even if it
would otherwise be a valid command-line option.

If encountered
after a previous instance of -- it is treated as a
pattern.

pattern

The pattern to be completed by
file or word.

-h | --help

If present, vis-complete
prints a usage summary and exits, ignoring any other flag
and arguments.

EXIT STATUS

The vis-complete utility
exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error
occurs.

In particular,
like vis-menu(1), vis-complete prints nothing and
sets its exit status to 1 if the user refused to select a
file.

BUGS

Because vis-complete uses
find(1) to obtain the list of files, weird things might
happen if you have control-characters in your filenames.
