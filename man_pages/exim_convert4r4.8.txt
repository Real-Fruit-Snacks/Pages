EXIM_CONVERT4R4(8)          System Manager's Manual         EXIM_CONVERT4R4(8)

NAME
       exim_convert4r4 - Convert Exim configuration from v3 to v4 format

SYNOPSIS
       exim_convert4r4

DESCRIPTION
       This script is provided to assist in updating Exim configuration files.
       It reads an Exim 3 configuration file on the standard input, and writes
       a  modified file on the standard output.  It also writes comments about
       what it has done to the standard error file.  It assumes that the input
       is a valid Exim 3 configuration file.  A typical call to the conversion
       script might be

       exim_convert4r4 < /etc/exim/exim.conf > /etc/exim4/exim4.conf.new

       The output file MUST be checked and tested before trying to use it on a
       live  system.  The conversion script is just an aid which does a lot of
       the “grunt work”.  It does not guarantee to produce an Exim 4  configu‐
       ration  that  behaves  exactly  the same as the Exim 3 configuration it
       reads.

       Each option change in the new file is preceded by an  identifying  com‐
       ment.   In  fact,  the  conversion script tends to make quite a mess of
       your configuration, and you should expect to go through  it  afterwards
       and tidy it up by hand.

       Unless  you are running a very straightforward configuration, the auto‐
       matic conversion is likely to  generate  a  non-optimal  configuration.
       You  should not only check it thoroughly, but also run as many tests as
       you can, to ensure that it is working as you  expect.   In  particular,
       you should test address routing, using -bt and -bv, and the policy con‐
       trols, using -bh.  If possible, you should  also  do  some  live  tests
       (i.e.  send  and receive some messages) before putting Exim 4 into ser‐
       vice.

       If you have a very  complicated  configuration,  it  is  possible  that
       exim_convert4r4 will break it in some situations, which is why thorough
       testing is strongly recommended.

BUGS
       This manual page needs a major re-work. If somebody knows better  groff
       than  us  and  has more experience in writing manual pages, any patches
       would be greatly appreciated.
