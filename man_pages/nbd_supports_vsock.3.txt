NAME

nbd_supports_vsock
- true if libnbd was compiled with support for AF_VSOCK

SYNOPSIS

#include

int nbd_supports_vsock ( 
struct nbd_handle *h 
);

DESCRIPTION

Returns true if
libnbd was compiled with support for the
"AF_VSOCK" family of sockets, or false if not.

Note that on
the Linux operating system, this returns true if there is
compile-time support, but you may still need runtime support
for some aspects of AF_VSOCK usage; for example, use of
"VMADDR_CID_LOCAL" as the server name requires
that the vsock_loopback kernel module is loaded.

RETURN VALUE

This call
returns a boolean value.

ERRORS

This function
does not fail.

The following
parameters must not be NULL: "h". For more
information see "Non-NULL parameters" in
libnbd(3).

VERSION

This function
first appeared in libnbd 1.16.

If you need to
test if this function is available at compile time check if
the following macro is defined:

#define
LIBNBD_HAVE_NBD_SUPPORTS_VSOCK 1
