time_t(3type)                                                    time_t(3type)

NAME
       time_t, suseconds_t, useconds_t - integer time

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <time.h>

       typedef /* ... */  time_t;

       #include <sys/types.h>

       typedef /* ... */  suseconds_t;
       typedef /* ... */  useconds_t;

DESCRIPTION
       time_t Used  for time in seconds.  According to POSIX, it is an integer
              type.

       suseconds_t
              Used for time in microseconds.  It is a signed integer type  ca‚Äê
              pable of storing values al least in the range [-1, 1000000].

       useconds_t
              Used  for  time in microseconds.  It is an unsigned integer type
              capable of storing values al least in the range [0, 1000000].

VERSIONS
       time_t <sched.h> defines time_t since POSIX.1-2008.

       suseconds_t
              POSIX.1-2001 defined useconds_t in <unistd.h> too.

STANDARDS
       time_t: C99 and later; POSIX.1-2001 and later.
       suseconds_t, useconds_t: POSIX.1-2001 and later.

NOTES
       On some architectures, the width of time_t can be controlled  with  the
       feature test macro _TIME_BITS.

       time_t The   following   headers   also   provide   time_t:  <sched.h>,
              <sys/msg.h>,    <sys/select.h>,    <sys/sem.h>,     <sys/shm.h>,
              <sys/stat.h>, <sys/time.h>, <sys/types.h>, and <utime.h>.

       suseconds_t
              The  following  headers also provide suseconds_t: <sys/select.h>
              and <sys/time.h>.
