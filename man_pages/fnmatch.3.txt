NAME

fnmatch -
compare a string against a filename wildcard

SYNOPSIS

@load
"fnmatch"

result =
fnmatch(pattern, string, flags)

DESCRIPTION

The
fnmatch extension provides an AWK interface to the
fnmatch(3) routine. It adds a single function named
fnmatch(), one predefined variable
(FNM_NOMATCH), and an array of flag values named
FNM.

The first
argument is the filename wildcard to match, the second is
the filename string, and the third is either zero, or the
bitwise OR of one or more of the flags in the FNM
array.

The return
value is zero on success, FNM_NOMATCH if the string
did not match the pattern, or a different non-zero value if
an error occurred.

The flags are
follows: 
FNM["CASEFOLD"]

Corresponds to the
FNM_CASEFOLD flag as defined in
fnmatch(3).

FNM["FILE_NAME"]

Corresponds to the
FNM_FILE_NAME flag as defined in
fnmatch(3).

FNM["LEADING_DIR"]

Corresponds to the
FNM_LEADING_DIR flag as defined in
fnmatch(3).

FNM["NOESCAPE"]

Corresponds to the
FNM_NOESCAPE flag as defined in
fnmatch(3).

FNM["PATHNAME"]

Corresponds to the
FNM_PATHNAME flag as defined in
fnmatch(3).

FNM["PERIOD"]

Corresponds to the
FNM_PERIOD flag as defined in fnmatch(3).

NOTES

Nothing
prevents AWK code from changing the predefined variable
FNM_NOMATCH, but doing so may cause strange
results.

EXAMPLE

@load
"fnmatch" 
... 
flags = or(FNM["PERIOD"],
FNM["NOESCAPE"]) 
if (fnmatch("*.a", "foo.c", flags) ==
FNM_NOMATCH)

print "no match"
