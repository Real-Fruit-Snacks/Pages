NAME

sendinpaths -
Send Usenet Path header field statistics via e-mail

SYNOPSIS

sendinpaths
[-cdhn] [-k keep-days] [-r
report-days] [address [address
...]]

DESCRIPTION

sendinpaths
checks pathlog/path for ninpaths dump files,
finds dump files generated in the past report-days
days, makes sure they are valid by running ninpaths
on each one and making sure the exit status is zero, and
passes them to ninpaths to generate a cumulative
report. By default, that report is mailed to the e-mail
addresses configured at the beginning of this script (by
default, only one address is configured:
top1000 [AT] anthologeek.net>) in order to supply the
TOP1000 project with useful statistics. See
http://top1000.anthologeek.net/> for more
information.

When finished,
sendinpaths deletes all dump files in
pathlog/path that are older than keep-days
days.

For more
information on how to set up ninpaths, see
ninpaths(8).

OPTIONS

-c

When this flag is used, the
report is also e-mailed, besides the default submission
addresses or those given as command-line arguments, to the
newsmaster’s address set at configure time.

-d

Enables debug messages.

-h

Gives usage information.

-k keep-days

After having processed dump
files, sendinpaths removes those that are older than
keep-days days. The default is "0", that is
to say to remove all dump files.

Setting
keep-days to another value can be useful for
debugging purpose because it permits keeping a few dump
files.

-n

Don’t e-mail the report; instead, just print it to
standard output. Don’t delete old dump files.

-r
report-days

Process dump files generated
during the last report-days days. The default is
"32", that is to say to process all the dump files
that have been generated during the last 32 days (if, of
course, they have not been deleted yet by a previous run of
sendinpaths according to the value set by the
-k flag).

address ...

E-mail the report to the
mentioned address or addresses, instead of the default one.
Several addresses can be used, separated by whitespace
(sending the e-mail to your own e-mail address can be useful
for debugging purpose, to check that everything works fine).
For instance, for two addresses:

sendinpaths
pathsurvey [AT] example.org top1000 [AT] anthologeek.net
