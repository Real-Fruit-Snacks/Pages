SYNOPSIS

#include

int
sd_bus_reply_method_return(sd_bus_message *call,

DESCRIPTION

sd_bus_reply_method_return()
sends a reply to the call message. The type string
types and the arguments that follow it must adhere to
the format described in sd_bus_message_append(3). If
no reply is expected to call, this function succeeds
without sending a reply.

On success,
this function returns a non-negative integer. On failure, it
returns a negative errno-style error code.

Errors

Returned errors may indicate the following problems:

-EINVAL

is NULL.

In addition,
any error returned by sd_bus_send(1) may be

NOTES

Functions
described here are available as a shared library, which can
be compiled against and linked to with the
libsystemd pkg-config(1) file.

The code
described here uses getenv(3), which is declared to
be not multi-thread-safe. This means that the code calling
the functions described here must not call setenv(3)
from a parallel thread. It is recommended to only do calls
to setenv() from an early phase of the program when
no other threads have been started.
