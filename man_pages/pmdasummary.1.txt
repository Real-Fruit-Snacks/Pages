NAME

pmdasummary
- summary performance metrics domain agent (PMDA)

SYNOPSIS

$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/summary/pmdasummary
[-d domain] [-h helpfile]
[-l logfile] [-U username]
pmie-command-line

DESCRIPTION

pmdasummary
is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which derives
performance metrics values from values made available by
other PMDAs. pmdasummary consists of two processes:

pmie process

The inference engine for
performance values pmie(1) is used to periodically
sample values for the base metrics and compute the derived
values. This process is launched with the given
pmie-command-line arguments by the main process,
described below.

main process

The main process reads and
buffers the values computed by pmie(1) and makes them
available to the performance metrics collector daemon
pmcd(1).

A brief
description of the pmdasummary command line options
follows:

-d

It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics
domain number specified here is unique and
consistent. That is, domain should be different for
every PMDA on the one host, and the same domain
number should be used for the same PMDA on all hosts.

-h

This option specifies an alternative help text file
helpfile for describing the metrics that
pmdasummary represents.

-l

Location of the log file. By default, a log file named
summary.log is written in the current directory of
pmcd(1) when pmdasummary is started, i.e.
$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd. If the log file cannot be created
or is not writable, output is written to the standard error
instead. 

-U

User account under which to run the agent. The default
is the unprivileged "pcp" account in current
versions of PCP, but in older versions the superuser account
("root") was used by default.

INSTALLATION

If you want
access to the names, help text and values for the summary
performance metrics, do the following as root:

# cd
$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/summary 
# ./Install

If you want to
undo the installation, do the following as root:

# cd
$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/summary 
# ./Remove

pmdasummary
is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be executed
directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify
pmcd(1) when the agent is installed or removed.

PCP ENVIRONMENT

Environment
variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On
each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains
the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).
