SIIS(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual SIIS(4)

NAME

siis — SiliconImage
Serial ATA Host Controller driver

SYNOPSIS

To compile this driver into the
kernel, place the following lines in your kernel
configuration file:

device pci

device scbus 
device siis

Alternatively,
to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following line in loader.conf(5):

siis_load="YES"

The following
tunables are settable from the loader(8):

hint.siis.X.msi

controls Message Signaled
Interrupts (MSI) usage by the specified controller.

hint.siisch.X.pm_level

controls SATA interface Power
Management for the specified channel, allowing some power to
be saved at the cost of additional command latency. Possible
values:

0

interface Power
Management is disabled (default);

1

device is
allowed to initiate PM state change, host is passive.

Note that
interface Power Management is not compatible with device
presence detection. A manual bus reset is needed on device
hot-plug.

hint.siisch.X.sata_rev

setting to nonzero value limits
maximum SATA revision (speed). Values 1, 2 and 3 are
respectively 1.5, 3 and 6Gbps.

DESCRIPTION

This driver provides the CAM(4)
subsystem with native access to the SATA ports of
controller. Each SATA port is represented to CAM as a
separate bus with 16 targets. Most of the bus-management
details are handled by the SATA-specific transport of CAM.
Connected ATA disks are handled by the ATA protocol disk
peripheral driver ada(4). ATAPI devices are handled by the
SCSI protocol peripheral drivers cd(4), da(4), sa(4),
etc.

Driver features
include support for Serial ATA and ATAPI devices, Port
Multipliers (including FIS-based switching), hardware
command queues (31 command per port), Native Command
Queuing, SATA interface Power Management, device hot-plug
and Message Signaled Interrupts.

The activity
LEDs of the adapters supported by the siis driver can
be controlled via the led(4) API for localization or status
reporting purposes.

HARDWARE

The siis driver supports
the following controller chips:

•

SiI3124 (PCI-X 133MHz/64bit, 4
ports)

•

SiI3131 (PCIe 1.0 x1, 1
port)

•

SiI3132 (PCIe 1.0 x1, 2
ports)

•

SiI3531 (PCIe 1.0 x1, 1
port)

HISTORY

The siis driver first
appeared in FreeBSD 8.0.
