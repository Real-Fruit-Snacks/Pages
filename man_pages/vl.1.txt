DESCRIPTION

vl
prints various information about an AtFS object repository.
While its main operation is to list the contents of an
object repository in a manner similar to ls(1), vl
knows about many options that extract additional information
about individual versions or version histories.

If vl is
invoked without any name arguments, it simply prints the
contents of the object repository, including files (busy
versions) and directories in the current directory.
Version objects in the object repository are represented as
filenames with a bracketed version identification
extension. Generally, vl tries to give the
illusion, as were all the versions in the object repository
regular files in the current directory. While busy versions
- which are regular files - may be manipulated by all
commands and tools that operate on files, version objects
can only be manipulated by special tools (ShapeTools) that
operate on the object repository. The tools that operate on
the object repository, however, can also access regular
files because these are also part of the object
repository.

With the
-h option given, vl prints out one information item
per history rather than per version. Default output in this
case is a list of history and directory names with the
range(s) of available versions following in brackets.

If filenames
are given as arguments to vl, similarly to ls(1) only
information about these object histories will be printed.
Object names may also be given in bound version
notation, i.e. a notation that identifies a particular
version of an object (e.g. mkattr.c[2.4]). It is
also possible to use a previously assigned symbolic
name rather than a numerical version identification
(e.g. mkattr.c[tools-V4R3]). Make sure to escape
the bracket symbols as these usually have meaning to the
shell. For further version binding possibilities (the
version binding options) see the vbind(1) manual
page.

The program
vlog prints the log-entry for specified objects.
Log-entries usually describe the reason for a particular
change to the design object that led to the creation of the
specified revision(s).

OPTIONS

All options
also available in the ls(1) programs are marked on the
following list. 
-?, -help

Print short information about
usage of this command.

-1 (ls)

Force single column output.

-a (ls)

List all entries, even those
with a name beginning with a &rsquo;.&rsquo; and the
&rsquo;AtFS&rsquo; entry. This option is default when vl is
called by the super user.

-all

List all available information.

-attr attribute

Print only information about
objects that have the specified attribute with the given
values. The attribute value match is done without attribute
expansion, even if -expand is set. attribute may also
be a standard attribute. For a complete list of standard
attributes names see the vadm(1) manual page.

-A (ls)

Same as -a, but
&rsquo;.&rsquo;, &rsquo;..&rsquo;, and &rsquo;AtFS&rsquo;
are not listed.

-c (ls)

Sort the list of printed
entries by the time of last status change.

-cache

List entries from the derived object cache too.

-C (ls)

Force multi column output. This
is default when printing just the entry names (no -l
and no -p option) and output goes to a terminal.

-d (ls)

With a directory name given as
argument, list the directory itself rather than its
contents.

-expand, -xpon

Expand attribute values before
printing. Attribute values may contain citations of other
attributes, or they may start with a special character
(&rsquo;^&rsquo;, &rsquo;!&rsquo; or &rsquo;*&rsquo;)
indicating that they need some kind of processing to
determine the real attribute value (see vattr(1) for
details). With the -expand option given, all
citations will be evaluated and the attribute will be
evaluated if necessary.

-fast

Fast operation. Suppresses reader/writer synchronisation
on AtFS archive files and ignores non-standard attributes.
In combination with -h (histories), a short output is
generated, that lists only the names of all histories and
not their version ranges.

-format format string

Specify custom-format for
information printed about objects. This is a simple report
generation facility for the shapeTools toolkit. The
format string can be any string, but typically
contains attribute citations (see retrv). As
shapeTools attribute citations use a syntax that
contains dollar-characters, it is advisable, to specify
format strings in single-quotes to prevent shell from
trying to apply variable substitution.

Format
strings can contain simple layout specifications
(&rsquo;\n&rsquo; for newline characters, and
&rsquo;\t&rsquo; for tabs.
&rsquo;\\&rsquo; is a single backslash.)

The format of
the output of vl -l could for example be specified as
follows:

vl -format &acute;$__mode$
$__state$$__author$ \ $__size$ $__mtime$
$__self$\n&acute;

While the example only
illustrates use of standard attributes, it is in fact
possible to use any object attribute (i.e. user-defined
attributes) in the format specification.

-F (ls)

Append a symbolic file type
character to each name. Directories are marked with a
&rsquo;/&rsquo;, sockets with a &rsquo;=&rsquo;, symbolic
links with a &rsquo;@&rsquo;, executable files with
&rsquo;*&rsquo;, and derived objects with a &rsquo;$&rsquo;.
If the file is locked a &rsquo;^&rsquo; is additionally
appended.

-g (ls)

Print the group of the entry
owner (...) .

-h

Print histories instead of versions. All versions
with the same name are folded together to one printed entry.
All version binding options (see vbind(1)) are ignored, when
displaying histories.

-intent

Print message of intention for
change. An intention message can be set while retrieving a
version using retrv with option -lock.

-l (ls)

List in long format, giving
mode, version state, author, size in bytes, the save date,
and version identification. For busy versions the date field
will contain the time of last modification rather than the
save date. The status of a version is printed as:
b for busy, s for saved, p for
proposed, P for published, a for accessed,
f for frozen, and $ for derived.

-lll

Same as -l -locked -locker.

-locked

Print only locked versions.

-locker

Print the locker instead of the
author and last locking date instead of last modification or
save date.

-log

Print the log entry for each version.

-L (ls)

Follow symbolic links. If a
given name is a symbolic link, list the object referenced by
the link rather than the link itself.

-noexpand, -xpoff

Do not expand attribute values.
This is the default, except when the -format option
is set. Check -expand or vattr(1) for more
information on attribute expansion.

-O

Print the version owner instead of the author.

-p "all" | attribute name

Print the value of the given
attribute. With the string &rsquo;all&rsquo; given as
argument to the -p option, print all non standard
attributes.

-q (ls)

Replace all non graphic
character by &rsquo;?&rsquo; before printing. This is the
default when output goes to a terminal.

-Q

Quiet Flag. Suppress any output to standard output. Only
error messages will be printed to standard error.

-r (ls)

Reverse the order of the
entries printed.

-R (ls)

Operate recursively visiting
all subdirectories encountered.

-S

Print version states verbosely.

-t (ls)

Sort the list of printed
entries by the modification time.

-u (ls)

Sort the list of printed
entries by time of last access.

-U

Show user identifications as user@domain rather
than just the user name.

-v

Print versions. This is the default (counterpart to

-version

Print only the version
identification of this program.

-x (ls)

Do multi-column output with the
entries sorted across rather than down the page.

BUGS

When using the
version binding options -since and -before,
the vl output may look confusing. -since and
-before define a time interval for save dates but
vl displays the date of last modification, which may
be older than the save date.

&rsquo;.&rsquo;
and &rsquo;..&rsquo; are always ignored when displaying
versions.

Several Options
are not available when displaying histories (-h
option). These are: -all, -attr, -c,
-format, -intent, -locked, -log,
-n, -p, -R, -t, and
-u.

The displayed
group name (-g option) may be wrong for busy
versions.

-noexpand does
not work together with -format.

-q, and
-F are not implemented.
