DIV(3POSIX)                POSIX Programmer's Manual               DIV(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       div — compute the quotient and remainder of an integer division

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdlib.h>

       div_t div(int numer, int denom);

DESCRIPTION
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with  the
       ISO C  standard.  Any  conflict between the requirements described here
       and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017
       defers to the ISO C standard.

       The  div() function shall compute the quotient and remainder of the di‐
       vision of the numerator numer by the denominator denom.  If  the  divi‐
       sion is inexact, the resulting quotient is the integer of lesser magni‐
       tude that is the nearest to the algebraic quotient. If the result  can‐
       not  be  represented,  the  behavior  is undefined; otherwise, quot*de‐
       nom+rem shall equal numer.

RETURN VALUE
       The div() function shall return a structure of type  div_t,  comprising
       both the quotient and the remainder. The structure includes the follow‐
       ing members, in any order:

           int  quot;  /* quotient */
           int  rem;   /* remainder */

ERRORS
       No errors are defined.
