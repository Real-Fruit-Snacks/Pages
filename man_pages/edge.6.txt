NAME

edge -
reference element (rheolef-7.2)

DESCRIPTION

The edge
reference_element(6) is K = [0,1].

0---------1

x

This
one-dimensional reference_element(6) is then
transformed, after the Piola geometrical application, as a
segment in a 1D, 2D or 3D physical space, as a
geo_element(6).

Curved high
order transformed geo_element(6) Pk edges (k >= 1)
are supported for 2D or 3D geometries. In these cases, the
nodes of an high-order edge are numbered as:

0----2----1
0--2--3--1 0-2-3-4-1 
P2 P3 P4

It means that
boundary nodes come first, and then are the internal
nodes.
