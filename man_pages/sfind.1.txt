NAME

sfind -
shapeTools RMS recursively descend a system hierarchy

SYNOPSIS

sfind
[-subs | -comp] directory
[command]

DESCRIPTION

Sfind
recursively descends the system hierarchy of a software
system managed by the shapeTools Release Management System
(shapeTools RMS). Sfind starts it&rsquo;s search from
directory downwards. According to the shapeTools RMS
conventions, directory must contain a Shapefile which
lists the subsystems in the variable SUBSYSTEMS and
the subsystem components in the variable
COMPONENTS. Each subsystem is visited.

If no
command is specified, sfind echoes the pathnames of
the subsystems it finds, or, if the option -comp is
given, the pathnames of the components of each
subsystem.

When a
command is given, it is executed in the directory of
each subsystem. The string &rsquo;&rsquo;{}&rsquo;&rsquo; in
command is replaced by the pathname of the subsystem
or component.

OPTIONS

-subs

command is invoked for
each subsystem. This is the default.
&rsquo;&rsquo;{}&rsquo;&rsquo; in command is replaced
by the pathname of the subsystem.

-comp

command is invoked for each component.
&rsquo;&rsquo;{}&rsquo;&rsquo; in command is replaced
by the pathname of the component.

EXAMPLES

List all system
components:

sfind -comp
~/development

Show the
pathnames of all versionfiles:

sfind
~/development echo -n {}/ \; shape -echo
VERSIONFILE

Echo
identification of the last release of each subsystem:

sfind
~/development vl -last -format \

\&rsquo;\$__lastrelease\$\\n\&rsquo;
\ 
\&rsquo;shape -echo VERSIONFILE\&rsquo;

Necessary
quoting to echo a pair of curly braces:

sfind
~/development echo two \\{\\} braces

SEE ALSO

find(1), sh(1),
shape(1), shape_RMS(1), shape_tmpl(7)

CAVEATS

Quoting of
shell meta characters can be tough.

BUGS

The program is
slow because shape(1) is called at least once for each
subsystem.

When
sfind is interrupted, usually shape(1) displays the
message &rsquo;&rsquo;shape - interrupted&rsquo;&rsquo;,
which may be confusing.
