NAME
       pamwipeout  -  replace detail with smooth gradient from one edge to the
       other

SYNOPSIS
       pamwipeout {-lr | -tb} [filename]

       Minimum unique abbreviation of options is acceptable.  You may use dou-
       ble hyphens instead of single hyphen to denote options.

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       The  pamwipeout  utility takes a Netpbm image as input and the uses two
       opposite edges of the image to wipe out anything in between.   You  can
       use  it in combination with pamcut and pnmpaste / pamcomp to remove un-
       wanted parts of a larger image.  The program replaces the pixels in be-
       tween the two edges with a gradient from one edge to the other.

       In  top-bottom  mode, the program reads the whole image into memory be-
       fore it can start processing.  In left-right it will read the  image  a
       row  at  the  time,  process  that row and write it to the output file.
       Therefore, in case of very large images, it may be better  to  use  in-
       stead  of  "pamwipeout  -tb"  a pipe of "pamflip -cw | pamwipeout -lr |
       pamflip -ccw".

       In his blog at

       www.i-am.ws <http://www.i-am.ws/entry/pnmblend_disappearing_act> ,  the
       author wrote about a predecessor of "pamwipeout" at the time named "pn-
       mblend". It shows a good example of what can be accomplished with  this
       utility.

PARAMETERS
       Filename  is  the  name  of  the input file. If you don't specify this,
       pamwipeout reads the image from Standard Input.

OPTIONS
       In addition to the options common to all programs  based  on  libnetpbm
       (most notably -quiet, see
        Common Options <index.html#commonoptions> ), pamwipeout recognizes the
       following command line options:

       -tb | -lr

              This option chooses between a vertical and a  horizontal  gradi-
              ent.  You must specify one of these, but not both.

SEE ALSO
       pam(1) and pamflip(1), pamcut(1), pamcomp(1), pnmpaste(1).
