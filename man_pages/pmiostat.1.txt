NAME

pmiostat,
pcp-iostat - report block I/O statistics

SYNOPSIS

pcp
[pcp options] iostat [-u?]
[-G method] [-P precision]
[-R pattern] [-x
[dm][,t][,h][,noidle]]

DESCRIPTION

pcp-iostat
reports I/O statistics for SCSI (by default) or other
devices (if the -x option is specified).

OPTIONS

When invoked
via the pcp(1) command, the pcp options
-A/--align, -a/--archive,
-h/--host, -O/--origin,
-S/--start, -s/--samples,
-T/--finish, -t/--interval,
-v/--version, -Z/--timezone and
-z/--hostzone become indirectly available;
refer to PCPIntro(1) for a complete description of
these options.

The additional
command line options available for pcp-iostat are:

-G method, --aggregate=method

Specifies that statistics for
device names matching the regular expression specified with
the -R regex option should be aggregated
according to method. Note this is aggregation based
on matching device names (not temporal aggregation). When
-G is used, the device name column is reported as
method(regex), e.g. if -G sum -R
&rsquo;sd(a|b)$&rsquo; is specified, the device column
will be sum(sd(a|b)$) and summed statistics
for sda and sdb will be reported in the
remaining columns. If -G is specified but -R
is not specified, then the default regex is
.*, i.e. matching all device names. If method
is sum then the statistics are summed. This includes
the %util column, which may therefore exceed 100% if
more than one device name matches. If method is
avg then the statistics are summed and then averaged
by dividing by the number of matching device names. If
method is min or max, the minimum or
maximum statistics for matching devices are reported,
respectively.

-P N,
--precision=N

This indicates the precision
(number of decimal places) to report. The default precision
N may be set to something other than the default (2).
Note that the avgrq-sz and avgqu-sz fields are
always reported with N+1 decimals of precision. These
fields typically have values less than 1.

-R pattern,
--regex=pattern

This restricts the report to
device names matching a regular expression pattern.
The given pattern is searched as a perl style regular
expression, and will match any portion of a device name.
e.g. &rsquo;^sd[a-zA-Z]+&rsquo; will match all device names
starting with &rsquo;sd&rsquo; followed by one or more
alphabetic characters. e.g. &rsquo;^sd(a|b)$&rsquo; will
only match &rsquo;sda&rsquo; and &rsquo;sdb&rsquo;. e.g.
&rsquo;sda$&rsquo; will match &rsquo;sda&rsquo; but not
&rsquo;sdab&rsquo;. See also the -G option for
aggregation options.

-u,
--no-interpolation

When replaying a set of
archives, by default values are reported according to the
requested sample interval (-t option), not according
to the actual interval recorded in the archive(s). Without
this option PCP interpolates the values to be reported based
on the records in the set of archives, which is particularly
useful when the -t option is used to replay a set of
archives with a longer sampling interval than that with
which the archive(s) was originally recorded with. With the
-u option, uninterpolated reporting is enabled -
every value is reported according to the native recording
interval in the set of archives. When the -u option
is specified, the -t option makes no sense and is
incompatible because the replay interval is always the same
as the recording interval in the set of archive. In
addition, -u only makes sense when replaying
archives, see the -a option on PCPIntro(1),
and so if -u is specified then -a must also be
specified.

-V, --version

Display version number and
exit.

-x
comma-separated-options

Specifies a comma-separated
list of one or more extended reporting options as follows:

dm - report statistics for device-mapper logical devices
instead of SCSI devices, 
t - prefix every line in the report with a timestamp in
ctime(3) format, 
h - omit the heading, which is otherwise reported every
24 samples, 
noidle - Do not display statistics for idle devices.

-?, --help

Display usage message and
exit.

REPORT

The columns in
the pcp-iostat report have the following
interpretation: 
Timestamp

When the -x t option is
specified, this column is the timestamp in ctime(3)
format.

Device

Specifies the scsi device name, or if -x dm is
specified, the device-mapper logical device name. When
-G is specified, this is replaced by the aggregation
method and regular expression - see the -G and
-R options above.

rrqm/s

The number of read requests expressed as a rate
per-second that were merged during the reporting interval by
the I/O scheduler.

wrqm/s

The number of write requests expressed as a rate
per-second that were merged during the reporting interval by
the I/O scheduler.

r/s

The number of read requests completed by the device
(after merges), expressed as a rate per second during the
reporting interval.

w/s

The number of write requests completed by the device
(after merges), expressed as a rate per second during the
reporting interval.

rkB/s

The average volume of data read from the device
expressed as KBytes/second during the reporting
interval. 

wkB/s

The average volume of data written to the device
expressed as KBytes/second during the reporting
interval. 

avgrq-sz

The average I/O request size
for both reads and writes to the device expressed as Kbytes
during the reporting interval.

avgqu-sz

The average queue length of
read and write requests to the device during the reporting
interval.

await

The average time in milliseconds that read and write
requests were queued (and serviced) to the device during the
reporting interval.

r_await

The average time in
milliseconds that read requests were queued (and serviced)
to the device during the reporting interval.

w_await

The average time in
milliseconds that write requests were queued (and serviced)
to the device during the reporting interval.

%util

The percentage of time during the reporting interval
that the device was busy processing requests. A value of
100% indicates device saturation.

PCP ENVIRONMENT

Environment
variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On
each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains
the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).

For environment
variables affecting PCP tools, see
pmGetOptions(3).
