NAME

lat_tcp -
measure interprocess communication latency via TCP/IP

SYNOPSIS

lat_tcp
-s 
lat_tcp [ -m  ] [ -P
 ] [ -W  ] [
-N  ] hostname 
lat_tcp -S hostname

DESCRIPTION

lat_tcp
is a client/server program that measures interprocess
communication latencies. The benchmark passes a message back
and forth between the two processes (this sort of benchmark
is frequently referred to as a &rsquo;&rsquo;hot
potato&rsquo;&rsquo; benchmark). No other work is done in
the processes.

lat_tcp
has three forms of usage: as a server (-s), as a client
(lat_tcp localhost), and as a shutdown (lat_tcp -S
localhost).

OUTPUT

The reported
time is in microseconds per round trip and includes the
total time, i.e., the context switching overhead is
includeded. Output format is like so

TCP latency
using localhost: 700 microseconds

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

Funding for the
development of this tool was provided by Sun Microsystems
Computer Corporation.
