NAME
       sane-mustek_pp - SANE backend for Mustek parallel port flatbed scanners

DESCRIPTION
       The  sane-mustek_pp library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy)
       backend that provides access to Mustek parallel port  flatbed  scanners
       and OEM versions.

       There are 2 classes of Mustek parallel port scanners: regular CCD (cold
       cathode device) scanners and CIS (contact image sensor) scanners.

       The current version of this backend supports both CCD type scanners and
       CIS type scanners.

       The following scanners might work with this backend:

       (*)     Calibration   problems  existed  with  earlier  version of this
              driver. They seem to be solved now.

       (**)   Problems have been reported in the past for the  MD/LT9850  type
              (striped  scans,  head moving in wrong direction at some resolu‐
              tions). It is not known  whether  the  current  version  of  the
              driver still has these problems.

       IF  YOU  HEAR  LOUD  CLICKING  NOISES, IMMEDIATELY UNPLUG THE SCANNER !
       (This holds for any type of scanner).

       (***)  Possibly, the engine_delay parameter has to be set to 1  ms  for
              accurate engine movements.

       Please note that this backend is still under construction. Certain mod‐
       els are currently not supported and some may never be because the  com‐
       munication protocol is still unknown (eg., SE 12000 P).

       Some scanners work faster when EPP/ECP is enabled in the BIOS. EPP mode
       however may lead to hard-locks on some Linux systems. If  that  is  the
       case for you, you can either disable ECP/EPP in your BIOS or disable it
       in the backend itself (see GLOBAL OPTIONS).

       Note that the backend needs to run as root or has to  have  appropriate
       access  rights  to /dev/parport* if libieee1284 support is compiled in.
       To allow user access to the scanner run the backend through the network
       interface  (See  saned(8) and sane-net(5)).  Note also that the backend
       does not support parport sharing, i.e. if you try printing while  scan‐
       ning,  your  computer may crash. To enable parport sharing, you have to
       enable libieee1284 at compile time. This backend  also  conflicts  with
       the sane-musteka4s2(5) backend. You can only enable one of them in your
       dll.conf.  However, you have to enable the backend explicitly  in  your
       dll.conf, just remove the hash mark in the line "mustek_pp".

DEVICE DEFINITION
       This  backend  allows multiple devices being defined and configured via
       the mustek_pp.conf file (even simultaneously, provided  that  they  are
       connected  to  different parallel ports). Please make sure to edit this
       file before you use the backend.

       A device can be defined as follows:

              scanner <name> <port name> <driver>

       where

       <name> is an arbitrary name for the device, optionally enclosed by dou‐
              ble quotes, for instance "LifeTec 9350".

       <port  name>  is  the  name of the parallel port to which the device is
              connected. In case libieee1284 is used  for  communication  with
              the  port  (default  setup), valid port names are parport0, par‐
              port1, and parport2.

       In case the backend is configured for raw  IO  (old  setup),  port  ad‐
       dresses  have to be used instead of port names: 0x378, 0x278, or 0x3BC.
       The mapping of parallel ports (lp0, lp1, and lp2)  to  these  addresses
       can  be different for different Linux kernel versions. For instance, if
       you are using a Kernel 2.2.x or better and you have only  one  parallel
       port,  this  port is named lp0 regardless of the base address. However,
       this backend requires the base address of your port.  If  you  are  not
       sure  which  port  your  scanner  is  connected to, have a look at your
       /etc/conf.modules, /etc/modules.conf and/or /proc/ioports.

       If you are unsure which port to use, you can use the magic value  *  to
       probe for your scanner.

       <driver>  is  the  driver  to  use for this device. Currently available
              drivers are:

              cis600   : for 600 CP, 96 CP & OEM versions
              cis1200  : for 1200 CP & OEM versions
              cis1200+ : for 1200 CP+ & OEM versions
              ccd300   : for 600 IIIE P & OEM version

              Choosing the wrong driver can damage your scanner!
              Especially, using the 1200CP settings on a 600CP can be harmful.
              If  the  scanner starts making a loud noise, turn it off immedi‐
              ately !!!

       Using the cis600 driver on a 1200CP or a 1200CP+ is probably  not  dan‐
       gerous.  The  cis1200+  driver also works for the 1200CP, and using the
       cis1200 driver on a 1200CP+ will typically result in scans  that  cover
       only half of the width of the scan area (also not dangerous).

       If  unsure about the exact model of your OEM version, check the optical
       resolution in the manual or on the box: the 600CP has a maximum optical
       resolution  of 300x600 DPI, whereas the 1200CP and 1200CP+ have a maxi‐
       mum optical resolution of 600x1200 DPI.

       Examples:

              scanner "LifeTec 9350" 0x378 cis1200

              scanner Mustek_600CP 0x378 cis600

              scanner Mustek_600IIIEP * ccd300

       If in doubt which port you have to use, or whether your scanner is  de‐
       tected at all, you can use sane-find-scanner -p to probe all configured
       ports.

CONFIGURATION
       The contents of the mustek_pp.conf file is a list of device definitions
       and device options that correspond to Mustek scanners.  Empty lines and
       lines starting with a hash mark (#) are ignored. Options have the  fol‐
       lowing format:

              option <name> [<value>]

       Depending  on  the  nature  of  the  option,  a value may or may not be
       present.  Options always apply to the scanner definition that  precedes
       them.  There  are  no global options. Options are also driver-specific:
       not all drivers support all possible options.

   Common options
       bw <value>
              Black/white discrimination value to be used during lineart scan‐
              ning.  Pixel  values  below  this value are assumed to be black,
              values above are assumed to be white.
              Default value: 127
              Minimum:         0
              Maximum:       255

              Example:  option bw 150

   CIS driver options
       top_adjust <value>
              Vertical adjustment  of  the  origin,  expressed  in  millimeter
              (floating  point).  This option can be used to calibrate the po‐
              sition of the origin, within certain limits. Note that CIS scan‐
              ners  are probably temperature sensitive, and that a certain in‐
              accuracy may be hard to avoid.  Differences  in  offset  between
              runs in the order of 1 to 2 mm are not unusual.
              Default value: 0.0
              Minimum:      -5.0
              Maximum:       5.0

              Example:  option top_adjust -2.5

       slow_skip
              Turns  fast  skipping  to the start of the scan region off. When
              the region to scan does not start at the origin, the driver will
              try  to  move  the scanhead to the start of the scan area at the
              fastest possible speed. On some models, this may not  work,  re‐
              sulting  in  large inaccuracies (up to centimeters).  By setting
              this option, the driver is forced to  use  normal  speed  during
              skipping, which can circumvent the accuracy problems. Currently,
              there are no models for  which  these  inaccuracy  problems  are
              known to occur.

              By default, fast skipping is used.

              Example:  option slow_skip

       engine_delay <value>
              Under  normal  circumstances, it is sufficient for the driver to
              wait for the scanner signaling that the engine is stable, before
              a  new engine command can be transmitted. In rare cases, certain
              scanners and/or parallel port chipsets appear to  prevent  reli‐
              able detection of the engine state. As a result, engine commands
              are transmitted too soon and the movement of  the  scanner  head
              becomes  unreliable.  Inaccuracies  ranging up to 10 cm over the
              whole vertical scan range have been  reported.  To  work  around
              this  problem, the engine_delay option can be set. If it is set,
              the driver waits an additional amount of time after every engine
              command,  equal to the engine_delay parameter, expressed in mil‐
              liseconds. It practice an engine_delay of 1 ms is usually suffi‐
              cient. The maximum delay is 100 ms.

              Note  that every additional ms of delay can add up to 14 seconds
              to the total scanning time (highest resolution), so an as  small
              as possible value is preferred.

              Default value:   0
              Minimum:         0
              Maximum:       100

              Example:  option engine_delay 1

   CCD driver options
       top <value>
              Number  of  scanlines to skip to the start of the scan area. The
              number can be any positive integer. Values known to  me  are  47
              and 56.

              Default value: 47
              Minimum:       0
              Maximum:       none

              Example:  option top 56

       waitbank <value>
              The  number  of  usecs to wait for a bank change. You should not
              touch this value actually. May be any positive integer

              Default value: 700
              Minimum:       0
              Maximum:       none

              Example:  option waitbank 700

       A sample configuration file is shown below:

       #
       # LifeTec/Medion 9350 on port 0x378
       #
       scanner "LifeTec 9350" 0x378 cis1200

       # Some calibration options (examples!).
       option bw 127
       option top_skip -0.8

       #
       # A Mustek 600CP on port 0x3BC
       #
       scanner "Mustek 600CP" 0x3BC cis600

       # Some calibration options (examples!).
       option bw 120
       option top_skip 1.2

       #

       #
       scanner "Mustek 1200CP plus" 0x278 cis1200+

       # Some calibration options (examples!).
       option bw 130
       option top_skip 0.2

       #

       # Some calibration options (examples!).
       option bw 130
       option top 56

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       You can control the overall behaviour of the  sane-stek_pp  backend  by
       global   options   which   precede   any   scanner  definition  in  the
       mustek_pp.conf file.

       Currently, there is only one global option:

   Global options
       no_epp Disable parallel port mode EPP: works around a known bug in  the
              Linux  parport  code.  Enable  this option, if the backend hangs
              when trying to access the parallel port in EPP mode.

              Default value: use EPP

              Example:  option no_epp

FILES
       /etc/sane.d/mustek_pp.conf
              The  backend  configuration  file  (see  also   description   of
              SANE_CONFIG_DIR below).

       /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-mustek_pp.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-mustek_pp.so
              The shared library implementing this backend (present on systems
              that support dynamic loading).

ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_CONFIG_DIR
              This environment variable specifies the list of directories that
              may contain the configuration file.  On *NIX systems, the direc‐
              tories are separated by a colon (`:'), under OS/2, they are sep‐
              arated  by a semi-colon (`;').  If this variable is not set, the
              configuration file  is  searched  in  two  default  directories:
              first,   the   current  working  directory  (".")  and  then  in
              /etc/sane.d.  If the value of the environment variable ends with
              the  directory separator character, then the default directories
              are searched after the explicitly  specified  directories.   For
              example,  setting SANE_CONFIG_DIR to "/tmp/config:" would result
              in directories tmp/config, ., and /etc/sane.d being searched (in
              this order).

       SANE_DEBUG_MUSTEK_PP
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this en‐
              vironment variable controls the debug level  for  this  backend.
              E.g.,  a  value  of 128 requests all debug output to be printed.
              Smaller levels reduce verbosity.

              level   debug output
              --------------------------------------
               0      nothing
               1      errors
               2      warnings & minor errors
               3      additional information
               4      debug information
               5      code flow (not supported yet)
               6      special debug information

       SANE_DEBUG_SANEI_PA4S2
              This variable sets the debug level for the  SANE  interface  for
              the  Mustek chipset A4S2. Note that enabling this will spam your
              terminal with some million lines of debug output.

              level   debug output
              ----------------------------
               0      nothing
               1      errors
               2      warnings
               3      things nice to know
               4      code flow
               5      detailed code flow
               6      everything

BUG REPORTS
       If  something doesn't work, please contact us (Jochen for the CCD scan‐
       ners, Eddy for the CIS scanners). But we need  some  information  about
       your scanner to be able to help you...

       SANE version
              Run scanimage -V to determine this.

       the backend version and your scanner hardware
              Run  SANE_DEBUG_MUSTEK_PP=128 scanimage -L as root. If you don't
              get any output from the sane-mustek_pp backend, make sure a line
              "mustek_pp" is included into your /etc/sane.d/dll.conf.  If your
              scanner isn't detected, make sure you've defined the right  port
              address in your mustek_pp.conf.

       the  name of your scanner/vendor also a worthy information. Please also
       include the
              optical resolution and lamp type of your scanner,  both  can  be
              found in the manual of your scanner.

       any further comments
              if you have comments about the documentation (what could be done
              better), or you think I should know  something,  please  include
              it.
