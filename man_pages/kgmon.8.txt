KGMON(8) BSD System Manager’s Manual KGMON(8)

NAME

kgmon — generate a
dump of the operating system’s profile buffers

SYNOPSIS

kgmon
[−Bbhpr] [−M core]
[−N system]

DESCRIPTION

The kgmon utility is used
when profiling the operating system. When no arguments are
supplied, kgmon indicates the state of operating
system profiling as running, off, or not configured. (see
config(8)) If the −p flag is specified,
kgmon extracts profile data from the operating system
and produces a gmon.out file suitable for later
analysis by gprof(1).

The options are
as follows:

−B

Resume the
collection of high resolution profile data.

−b

Resume the
collection of low resolution profile data.

−h

Stop the
collection of profile data.

−p

Dump the
contents of the profile buffers into a gmon.out
file.

−r

Reset all the
profile buffers. If the −p flag is also
specified, the gmon.out file is generated before the
buffers are reset.

−M

Extract values
associated with the name list from the specified core
instead of the default /dev/kmem.

−N

Extract the
name list from the specified system instead of the default
/boot/kernel/kernel.

If neither
−B nor −b nor −h is
specified, the state of profiling collection remains
unchanged. For example, if the −p flag is
specified and profile data is being collected, profiling
will be momentarily suspended, the operating system profile
buffers will be dumped, and profiling will be immediately
resumed.

The profile
buffers should be reset when the resolution of the profile
data is changed.

FILES 
/boot/kernel/kernel

the default
system

/dev/kmem

the default
memory

DIAGNOSTICS

Users with only read permission
on /dev/kmem cannot change the state of profiling
collection. They can get a gmon.out file with the
warning that the data may be inconsistent if profiling is in
progress.
