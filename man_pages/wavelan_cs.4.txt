NAME

wavelan_cs
− AT&T GIS WaveLAN PCMCIA device driver

SYNOPSIS

insmod
wavelan_cs.o [irq_list=i,j,...]
[mem_speed=n] [do_roaming=n]

DESCRIPTION

wavelan_cs
is the low-level Card Services driver for the NCR / AT&T
/ Lucent WaveLAN PCMCIA and Digital (DEC)
RoamAbout DS wireless ethernet adapter. When this
driver is attached to a card, it allocates the next
available ethernet device (eth0..eth#). This device name
will be passed on to cardmgr(8) for the card
configuration, and reported in the kernel log file with the
MAC address, NWID and frequency used by the card.

PARAMETERS

irq_list=i,j,...

Specifies the set of interrupts
that may be allocated by this driver.

mem_speed=n

Sets the access speed of the
shared memory window, in nanoseconds. The default is 0
(i.e., no extra wait states).

do_roaming=n

Enables or disables roaming
mode. The default is 1 (roam).

WIRELESS EXTENSIONS

Use
iwconfig(8) to manipulate wireless extensions.

Mode

Set the operating mode to Ad-Hoc or Managed.
This in fact disable or enable roaming support. This setting
is not saved in hardware.

Network
ID 
Set the network ID [0 to FFFF] or disable it
[off] or reenable it [on]. As the NWID is
stored in the card Permanent Storage Area, it will be reuse
at any further invocation of the driver.

Frequency
& channels 
For the 2.4GHz 2.00 Hardware, you are able to set the
frequency by specifying one of the 10 defined channels
(2.412, 2.422, 2.425, 2.4305, 2.432, 2.442, 2.452, 2.460,
2.462 or 2.484) or directly by its value. The
frequency is changed immediately and permanentely. Frequency
availability depend on the regulations...

Sensitivity

Signal level threshold for packet reception [0 to
63]. Should be set according to the ambiant noise
level.

Encryption
key 
Set the encryption key [0 to
FFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFF]. Use [off] and
[on] to disable and reenable the hardware encryption.
This feature works only for device with encryption option
(DES or AES).

Statistics
spy 
Set a list of MAC addresses in the driver (up to 8) and get
the last quality of link for each of those (see
iwspy(8)).

/proc/net/wireless

status is the status reported by the modem. Link
quality reports the quality of the modulation on the air
(direct sequence spread spectrum) [max = 16]. Level
and Noise refer to the signal level and noise level
[max = 64]. The crypt discarded packet and misc
discarded packet counters are not implemented.

PRIVATE IOCTL

You may use
iwpriv(8) to manipulate private ioctls.

Quality
threshold 
Enable you the define the quality threshold used by the
modem (packet below that level are discarded).

Histogram

This functionality allow to set a number of signal level
intervals and to count the number of packets received in
each of those defined intervals. This distribution might be
used to calculate the mean value and standard deviation of
the signal level.

OTHER FEATURES

Hot unplug
support. 
Power saving (use ’ifconfig down’).

SPECIFIC NOTES

This driver
will fail to load some non NCR/ATT&T/Lucent
Wavelan cards. If it’s your case, you must look in the
source code on how to add your card to the detection
routine.

Some of the
mentioned features are optional. You may enable to disable
them by changing flags in the driver header and
recompile.
