NAME

rpc.rstatd — kernel
statistics server

SYNOPSIS

/usr/sbin/rpc.rstatd
[INTERFACE]...

DESCRIPTION

rpc.rstatd is a RPC
daemon which collects performance statistics from kernel on
serving machine. This implementation for the Linux
Operating System also returns the number of users logged in
on the remote machine if the information is available.

It also allows
to specify which network interfaces to include in the packet
count. If no interface names are specified packets from all
interfaces besides the loopback interface are added up.

The statistics
are queried using rup(1) , perfmeter(1) , etc. The
rpc.rstatd daemon is normally invoked by
inetd(8).

rpc.rstatd
uses an RPC protocol defined in
/usr/include/rpcsvc/rstat.x.
