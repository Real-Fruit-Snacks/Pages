FDESCFS(5) BSD File Formats Manual FDESCFS(5)

NAME

fdescfs &mdash;
file-descriptor file system

SYNOPSIS

fdescfs

/dev/fd

fdescfs rw 0 0

DESCRIPTION

The file-descriptor file system,
or fdescfs, provides access to the per-process file
descriptor namespace in the global file system namespace.
The conventional mount point is /dev/fd.

The file
system&rsquo;s contents appear as a list of numbered files
which correspond to the open files of the process reading
the directory. The files /dev/fd/0 through
/dev/fd/# refer to file descriptors which can be
accessed through the file system. If the file descriptor is
open and the mode the file is being opened with is a subset
of the mode of the existing descriptor, the call:

fd =
open("/dev/fd/0", mode);

and the
call:

fd = fcntl(0,
F_DUPFD, 0);

are
equivalent.

Flags to the
open(2) call other than O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY and O_RDWR are
ignored.
