NAME

mkesmtpdcert -
Create a secure SMTP test certificate

SYNOPSIS

/usr/sbin/mkesmtpdcert 

DESCRIPTION

Secure ESMTP
requires a valid, signed, X.509 certificate. The default
location for the certificate file is
/etc/courier/esmtpd.pem. The mkesmtpdcert generates a
self-signed X.509 certificate, mainly for testing. For
production use the X.509 certificate must be signed by a
recognized certificate authority, in order for mail clients
to accept the certificate.

/etc/courier/esmtpd.pem
must be owned by the courier user and have no group or world
permissions. The mkesmtpdcert command will enforce
this. To prevent an unfortunate accident,
mkesmtpdcert will not work if /etc/courier/esmtpd.pem
already exists.

mkesmtpdcert
requires OpenSSL to be installed.
