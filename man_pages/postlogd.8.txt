NAME

postlogd -
Postfix internal log server

SYNOPSIS

postlogd
[generic Postfix daemon options]

DESCRIPTION

This program
logs events on behalf of Postfix programs when the maillog
configuration parameter specifies a non-empty value.

BUGS

Non-daemon
Postfix programs don’t know that they should log to
the internal logging service before they have processed
command-line options and main.cf parameters. These programs
still log earlier events to the syslog service.

If Postfix is
down, the non-daemon programs postfix(1),
postsuper(1), postmulti(1), and
postlog(1), will log directly to
$maillog_file. These programs expect to run with root
privileges, for example during Postfix start-up, reload, or
shutdown.

Other
non-daemon Postfix programs will never write directly to
$maillog_file (also, logging to stdout would
interfere with the operation of some of these programs).
These programs can log to postlogd(8) if they are run
by the super-user, or if their executable file has set-gid
permission. Do not set this permission on programs other
than postdrop(1), postqueue(1) and (Postfix
>= 3.7) postlog(1).

CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS

Changes to
main.cf are not picked up automatically, because
postlogd(8) terminates only after reaching the
max_idle time limit. Use the command "postfix
reload" to speed up a change.

The text below
provides only a parameter summary. See postconf(5)
for more details including examples. 
config_directory (see ’postconf -d’
output)

The default location of the
Postfix main.cf and master.cf configuration files.

maillog_file (empty)

The name of an optional logfile
that is written by the Postfix postlogd(8)
service.

process_id
(read-only)

The process ID of a Postfix
command or daemon process.

process_name
(read-only)

The process name of a Postfix
command or daemon process.

syslog_name (see
’postconf -d’ output)

A prefix that is prepended to
the process name in syslog records, so that, for example,
"smtpd" becomes "prefix/smtpd".

service_name
(read-only)

The master.cf service name of a
Postfix daemon process.

postlogd_watchdog_timeout
(10s)

How much time a
postlogd(8) process may take to process a request
before it is terminated by a built-in watchdog timer.

Available in
Postfix 3.9 and later: 
maillog_file_permissions (0600)

The file access permissions
that will be set when the file $maillog_file is created for
the first time, or when the file is created after an
existing file is rotated.
