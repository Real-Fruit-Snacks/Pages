NAME

ipresend
&minus; resend IP packets out to network

SYNOPSIS

ipresend
[ &minus;EHPRSTX ] [ &minus;d  ]
[ &minus;g gateway> ] [ &minus;m
MTU> ] [ &minus;r
filename> ]

DESCRIPTION

ipresend
was designed to allow packets to be resent, once captured,
back out onto the network for use in testing.
ipresend supports a number of different file formats
as input, including saved snoop/tcpdump binary data.

OPTIONS

&minus;d

Set the interface name to be
the name supplied. This is useful with the &minus;P,
&minus;S, &minus;T and &minus;E options, where it
is not otherwise possible to associate a packet with an
interface. Normal "text packets" can override this
setting.

&minus;g

Specify the hostname of the
gateway through which to route packets. This is required
whenever the destination host isn&rsquo;t directly attached
to the same network as the host from which you&rsquo;re
sending.

&minus;m 

Specify the MTU to be used when
sending out packets. This option allows you to set a fake
MTU, allowing the simulation of network interfaces with
small MTU&rsquo;s without setting them so.

&minus;r

Specify the filename from which
to take input. Default is stdin.

&minus;E

The input file is to be text output from etherfind. The
text formats which are currently supported are those which
result from the following etherfind option combinations:

etherfind
-n

etherfind -n -t

&minus;H

The input file is to be hex
digits, representing the binary makeup of the packet. No
length correction is made, if an incorrect length is put in
the IP header.

&minus;P

The input file specified by &minus;i is a binary
file produced using libpcap (i.e., tcpdump version 3).
Packets are read from this file as being input (for rule
purposes). 

&minus;R

When sending packets out, send them out "raw"
(the way they came in). The only real significance here is
that it will expect the link layer (i.e. ethernet) headers
to be prepended to the IP packet being output.

&minus;S

The input file is to be in "snoop" format (see
RFC 1761). Packets are read from this file and used as input
from any interface. This is perhaps the most useful input
type, currently.

&minus;T

The input file is to be text output from tcpdump. The
text formats which are currently supported are those which
result from the following tcpdump option combinations:

tcpdump -n

tcpdump -nq

tcpdump -nqt

tcpdump -nqtt

tcpdump -nqte

&minus;X

The input file is composed of
text descriptions of IP packets.

DIAGNOSTICS

Needs to be run
as root.

BUGS

Not all of the
input formats are sufficiently capable of introducing a wide
enough variety of packets for them to be all useful in
testing. If you find any, please send email to me at
