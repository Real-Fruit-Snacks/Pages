GPROFNG(1)                       User Commands                      GPROFNG(1)

NAME
       gprofng - the driver for the gprofng tool suite

SYNOPSIS
       gprofng [OPTION(S)] COMMAND [KEYWORD] [ARGUMENTS]

DESCRIPTION
       This  is  the  driver for the GPROFNG tools suite to gather and analyze
       performance data.

OPTIONS
       --version
              print the version number and exit.

       --help print usage information and exit.

       --check
              verify if the hardware and software environment is supported.

       --verbose {on|off}
              enable (on) or disable (off) verbose mode; the default is "off".

COMMANDS
       The driver supports various commands. These are listed below.

       It is also possible to invoke the lower level  commands  directly,  but
       since these are subject to change, in particular the options, we recom‐
       mend to use the driver.

       The man pages for the commands below can be viewed  using  the  command
       name  with "gprofng" replaced by "gp" and the spaces replaced by a dash
       ("-"). For example the man page  name  for  "gprofng  collect  app"  is
       "gp-collect-app".

       The following combination of commands and keywords are supported:

       Collect performance data

       gprofng collect app
              collect application performance data.

       Display the performance results

       gprofng display text
              display the performance data in ASCII format.

       gprofng display html
              generate an HTML file from one or more experiments.

       gprofng display src
              display source or disassembly with compiler annotations.

       Miscellaneous commands

       gprofng archive
              include binaries and source code in an experiment directory.

ENVIRONMENT
       The following environment variables are supported:

       GPROFNG_MAX_CALL_STACK_DEPTH
              set the depth of the call stack (default is 256).

       GPROFNG_USE_JAVA_OPTIONS
              may be set when profiling a C/C++ application that uses dlopen()
              to execute Java code.

       GPROFNG_SSH_REMOTE_DISPLAY
              use this variable to define the ssh command executed by the  re‐
              mote display tool.

       GPROFNG_SKIP_VALIDATION
              set this variable to disable checking hardware, system, and Java
              versions.

       GPROFNG_ALLOW_CORE_DUMP
              set this variable to allow a core file to be  generated;  other‐
              wise an error report is created on /tmp.

       GPROFNG_ARCHIVE
              use this variable to define the settings for automatic archiving
              upon experiment recording completion.

       GPROFNG_ARCHIVE_COMMON_DIR
              set this variable to the location of the common archive.

       GPROFNG_JAVA_MAX_CALL_STACK_DEPTH
              set the depth of the Java call stack; the default is 256; set to
              0 to disable capturing of call stacks.

       GPROFNG_JAVA_NATIVE_MAX_CALL_STACK_DEPTH
              set the depth of the Java native call stack; the default is 256;
              set to 0 to disable capturing of call stacks (JNI  and  assembly
              call stacks are not captured).

DOCUMENTATION
       A  getting started guide for gprofng is maintained as a Texinfo manual.
       If the info and gprofng programs are properly installed at  your  site,
       the command "info gprofng" should give you access to this document.
