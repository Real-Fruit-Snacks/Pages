NAME
       Image::ExifTool::CanonRaw - Read Canon RAW (CRW) meta information

SYNOPSIS
       This module is loaded automatically by Image::ExifTool when required.

DESCRIPTION
       This module contains definitions required by Image::ExifTool to
       interpret meta information from Canon CRW raw files.  These files are
       written directly by some Canon cameras, and contain meta information
       similar to that found in the EXIF Canon maker notes.

NOTES
       The CR2 format written by some Canon cameras is very different the CRW
       format processed by this module.  (CR2 is TIFF-based and uses standard
       EXIF tags.)
