PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       getpwuid, getpwuid_r — search user database for a user ID

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pwd.h>

       struct passwd *getpwuid(uid_t uid);
       int getpwuid_r(uid_t uid, struct passwd *pwd, char *buffer,
           size_t bufsize, struct passwd **result);

DESCRIPTION
       The getpwuid() function shall search the user  database  for  an  entry
       with a matching uid.

       The getpwuid() function need not be thread-safe.

       Applications  wishing to check for error situations should set errno to
       0 before calling getpwuid().  If getpwuid() returns a null pointer  and
       errno is set to non-zero, an error occurred.

       The  getpwuid_r() function shall update the passwd structure pointed to
       by pwd and store a pointer to that structure at the location pointed to
       by result.  The structure shall contain an entry from the user database
       with a matching uid.  Storage referenced by the structure is  allocated
       from  the  memory  provided with the buffer parameter, which is bufsize
       bytes in size. A call to sysconf(_SC_GETPW_R_SIZE_MAX)  returns  either
       -1 without changing errno or an initial value suggested for the size of
       this buffer.  A null pointer shall be returned at the location  pointed
       to by result on error or if the requested entry is not found.

RETURN VALUE
       The  getpwuid() function shall return a pointer to a struct passwd with
       the structure as defined in <pwd.h> with a matching entry if  found.  A
       null  pointer shall be returned if the requested entry is not found, or
       an error occurs. If the requested entry was not found, errno shall  not
       be changed. On error, errno shall be set to indicate the error.

       The  application  shall  not  modify  the structure to which the return
       value points, nor any storage areas pointed to by pointers  within  the
       structure.  The  returned  pointer,  and pointers within the structure,
       might be invalidated or the structure or the  storage  areas  might  be
       overwritten  by  a  subsequent call to getpwent(), getpwnam(), or getp‐
       wuid().  The returned pointer, and pointers within the structure, might
       also be invalidated if the calling thread is terminated.

       If  successful, the getpwuid_r() function shall return zero; otherwise,
       an error number shall be returned to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       These functions may fail if:

       EIO    An I/O error has occurred.

       EINTR  A signal was caught during getpwuid().

       EMFILE All file descriptors available  to  the  process  are  currently
              open.

       ENFILE The  maximum  allowable number of files is currently open in the
              system.

       The getpwuid_r() function may fail if:

       ERANGE Insufficient storage was supplied via buffer and bufsize to con‐
              tain  the  data  to be referenced by the resulting passwd struc‐
              ture.

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       Note that sysconf(_SC_GETPW_R_SIZE_MAX) may return -1 if  there  is  no
       hard limit on the size of the buffer needed to store all the groups re‐
       turned. This example shows how an application can allocate a buffer  of
       sufficient size to work with getpwuid_r().

           long int initlen = sysconf(_SC_GETPW_R_SIZE_MAX);
           size_t len;
           if (initlen == -1)
               /* Default initial length. */
               len = 1024;
           else
               len = (size_t) initlen;
           struct passwd result;
           struct passwd *resultp;
           char *buffer = malloc(len);
           if (buffer == NULL)
               ...handle error...
           int e;
           while ((e = getpwuid_r(42, &result, buffer, len, &resultp)) == ERANGE)
               {
               size_t newlen = 2 * len;
               if (newlen < len)
                   ...handle error...
               len = newlen;
               char *newbuffer = realloc(buffer, len);
               if (newbuffer == NULL)
                   ...handle error...
               buffer = newbuffer;
               }
           if (e != 0)
               ...handle error...
           free (buffer);

   Getting an Entry for the Root User
       The  following  example  gets the user database entry for the user with
       user ID 0 (root).

           #include <sys/types.h>
           #include <pwd.h>
           ...
           uid_t id = 0;
           struct passwd *pwd;

           pwd = getpwuid(id);

   Finding the Name for the Effective User ID
       The following example defines pws as a pointer to a structure  of  type
       passwd,  which  is  used to store the structure pointer returned by the
       call to the getpwuid() function. The geteuid()  function  shall  return
       the  effective  user  ID  of  the  calling process; this is used as the
       search criteria for the getpwuid() function.  The  call  to  getpwuid()
       shall return a pointer to the structure containing that user ID value.

           #include <unistd.h>
           #include <sys/types.h>
           #include <pwd.h>
           ...
           struct passwd *pws;
           pws = getpwuid(geteuid());

   Finding an Entry in the User Database
       The following example uses getpwuid() to search the user database for a
       user ID that was previously stored in a stat structure, then prints out
       the  user  name  if  it is found. If the user is not found, the program
       prints the numeric value of the user ID for the entry.

           #include <sys/types.h>
           #include <pwd.h>
           #include <stdio.h>
           ...
           struct stat statbuf;
           struct passwd *pwd;
           ...
           if ((pwd = getpwuid(statbuf.st_uid)) != NULL)
               printf(" %-8.8s", pwd->pw_name);
           else
               printf(" %-8d", statbuf.st_uid);

APPLICATION USAGE
       Three names associated with the current process can be determined: get‐
       pwuid(geteuid()) returns the name associated with the effective user ID
       of the process; getlogin() returns the name associated with the current
       login activity; and getpwuid(getuid()) returns the name associated with
       the real user ID of the process.

       The getpwuid_r() function is thread-safe and returns values in a  user-
       supplied  buffer  instead of possibly using a static data area that may
       be overwritten by each call.

       Portable applications should take into account that it is usual for  an
       implementation  to return -1 from sysconf() indicating that there is no
       maximum for _SC_GETPW_R_SIZE_MAX.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
