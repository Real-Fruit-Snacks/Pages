NAME

fspd, in.fspd
&minus; File Service Protocol (FSP) server

SYNOPSIS

fspd [-f
configfile] [-p port] [-i] [-v|-V] [-t timeout] [-X] [-d
directory] [-F ] [-T temporary directory] [-l
logfile]

DESCRIPTION

fspd is
the server for an anonymous-ftp style archive called FSP.
The main features of this service are: connection-less
model, communication robustness, server resource protection,
inter-client protection, and user friendly interface. Please
read the INFO file bundled with the FSP source for more
information.

OPTIONS

-f

May be used to specify an
alternate configuration file.

-i

Use when fspd is running from inetd.

-p port

May be used to specify an alternative port.

-d directory

May be used to specify an alternative home
directory. 

-v | -V

Show server version.

-X

Turn on debuging.

-t timeout

Set server inactivity shutdown timeout for running in
inetd mode. Default is 120 seconds. When -d is used, this
timeout works in normal mode also (usefull for debuging of
memory leaks).

-F

Run fspd in foreground, do not daemonize.

-T directory

Set server temporary directory used for uploading. This
directory can be outside FSP home directory since it is not
directly accessible by clients. Using directory inside FSP
home is not a security risk.

-l logfile

Write log output to file.
