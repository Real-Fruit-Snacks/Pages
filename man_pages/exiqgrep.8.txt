NAME
       exiqgrep - Search in the exim queue

SYNOPSIS
       exiqgrep  [-h]  [-C  file] [-f regexp] [-r regexp] [-s regexp] [-y sec‐
       onds] [-o seconds] [-z] [-x] [-G queuename] [-c] [-l]  [-i]  [-b]  [-R]

DESCRIPTION
       The  exiqgrep  utility  is  a Perl script which offers possibilities to
       grep in the exim queue output. Unlike exiqsumm, it  invokes  exim  -bpu
       itself and does not need to be invoked in a pipe.
