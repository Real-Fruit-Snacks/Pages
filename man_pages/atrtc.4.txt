ATRTC(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual ATRTC(4)

NAME

atrtc &mdash; AT
Real-Time Clock (RTC) driver

SYNOPSIS

This driver is a mandatory part
of i386/amd64 kernels.

The following
tunables are settable from the loader(8):

hint.atrtc.X.clock

controls event timers
functionality support. Setting to 0, disables it. Default
value is 1.

hw.atrtc.enable

Forces enabling or disabling of
the device(s). Setting to 0 disables it, setting to 1
enables it, bypassing any platform configuration hints.
Default value is -1 (autodetect).

DESCRIPTION

This driver uses RTC hardware to
supply kernel with time-of-day clock with 1 second
resolution and one event timer. This hardware uses base
frequency of 32768Hz for advancing time-of-day clock and
generating periodic interrupts. Interrupts could be
generated with fixed number of frequencies, from 2Hz to
8192Hz, obtained by dividing base frequency by one of
supported power-of-2 divisors.

Event timer
provided by the driver is irrelevant to CPU power
states.
