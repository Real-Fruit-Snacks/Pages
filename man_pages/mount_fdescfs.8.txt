MOUNT_STD(8) BSD System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
MOUNT_STD(8)

NAME

mount_std,
mount_devfs, mount_fdescfs,
mount_linprocfs, mount_procfs &mdash; mount
&rsquo;&rsquo;standard&rsquo;&rsquo; file systems

SYNOPSIS

mount_fsname
[&minus;o options] fs
mount_point

DESCRIPTION

The mount_std utility is
a generic mechanism for attaching
&rsquo;&rsquo;standard&rsquo;&rsquo; file systems to the
file system. The mount_std utility currently supports
the following file systems: devfs, fdescfs,
linprocfs and procfs. A
&rsquo;&rsquo;standard&rsquo;&rsquo; file system is one
which:

1.

accepts only the standard
&minus;o options &rsquo;&rsquo;ro&rsquo;&rsquo;,
&rsquo;&rsquo;rw&rsquo;&rsquo;,
&rsquo;&rsquo;nodev&rsquo;&rsquo;,
&rsquo;&rsquo;noexec&rsquo;&rsquo;,
&rsquo;&rsquo;nosuid&rsquo;&rsquo;, and
&rsquo;&rsquo;union&rsquo;&rsquo;.

2.

has a kernel file system module
name the same as its user-visible name.

3.

requires no other special
processing on the part of the mount_std utility.

The options are
as follows:

&minus;o

Options are
specified with a &minus;o flag followed by a comma
separated string of options. See the mount(8) man page for
possible options and their meanings.

The
mount_std utility examines its zeroth command-line
argument (the name by which it was called) to determine the
type of file system to be mounted. If it is called by a name
which does not end in
&rsquo;&rsquo;_fsname&rsquo;&rsquo;, mount_std
will assume (for compatibility with mount(8)) that the
zeroth argument contains only the name of the file system
type. The mount_std utility is normally installed
with appropriate links to commands for the distributed file
systems which can be mounted in this way; for information on
the function of each file system, see the manual page for
that specific mount_fsname utility.

Refer to the
following manual pages for detailed information on these
file system: devfs(5), fdescfs(5), linprocfs(5) and
procfs(5).

DIAGNOSTICS

argv[0] must end in
_fsname  The mount_std utility was called
with a zeroth argument of
&rsquo;&rsquo;mount_std&rsquo;&rsquo;.

%s file
system not available  The specified file system
type was not present in the kernel and no loadable module
for it was found.

&rsquo;&rsquo;standard&rsquo;&rsquo; file systems may be
NFS-exported.
