NAME

radius.conf
− Configuration for nnrpd RADIUS authenticator

DESCRIPTION

This describes
the format and attributes of the configuration file for the
nnrpd RADIUS authenticator. See
radius(1) for more information about the
authenticator program. The default location for this file is
radius.conf in pathetc.

Blank lines and
lines beginning with "#" are ignored, as
is anything after a "#" on a line. All
other lines should begin with a parameter name followed by a
colon and the value of that key, except that each section of
configuration for a particular server should be enclosed
in:

    server  {
        # parameters...
    }

where
 is just some convenient label for that
server.

The available
parameters are: 
radhost

The hostname of the
RADIUS server to use for authentication. This
parameter must be set.

radport

The port to query on the
RADIUS server. Defaults to 1645 if not
set.

lochost

The hostname or
IP address making the request. The
RADIUS server expects an IP
address; a hostname will be translated into an
IP address with gethostbyname(). If
not given, this information isn’t included in the
request (not all RADIUS setups require this
information).

locport

The port the client being
authenticated is connecting to. If not given, defaults to
119. This doesn’t need to be set unless readers are
connecting to a non-standard port.

secret

The shared secret with the
RADIUS server. If your secret includes
spaces, tabs, or "#", be sure to include
it in double quotes. This parameter must be set.

prefix

Prepend the value of this
parameter to all usernames before passing them to the
RADIUS server. Can be used to prepend
something like "news−" to all
usernames in order to put news users into a different
namespace from other accounts served by the same server. If
not set, nothing is prepended.

suffix

Append the value of this
parameter to all usernames before passing them to the
RADIUS server. This is often something like
"@example.com", depending on how your
RADIUS server is set up. If not set, nothing
is appended.

ignore-source

Can be set to
"true" or "false". If
set to false, the RADIUS authenticator will
check to ensure that the response it receives is from the
same IP address as it sent the request to
(for some added security). If set to true, it will skip this
verification check (if your RADIUS server has
multiple IP addresses or if other odd things
are going on, it may be perfectly normal for the response to
come from a different IP address).

EXAMPLE

Here is a
configuration for a news server named news.example.com,
authenticating users against radius.example.com and
appending "@example.com" to all
client-supplied usernames before passing them to the
RADIUS server:

    server example {
        radhost: radius.example.com
        lochost: news.example.com
        secret: IamARADIUSsecRET
        suffix: @example.com
    }

The shared
secret with the RADIUS server is
"IamARADIUSsecRET".
