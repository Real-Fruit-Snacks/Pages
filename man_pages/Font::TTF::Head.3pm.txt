NAME
       Font::TTF::Head - The head table for a TTF Font

DESCRIPTION
       This is a very basic table with just instance variables as described in
       the TTF documentation, using the same names. One of the most commonly
       used is "unitsPerEm".

INSTANCE VARIABLES
       The "head" table has no internal instance variables beyond those common
       to all tables and those specified in the standard:

           version
           fontRevision
           checkSumAdjustment
           magicNumber
           flags
           unitsPerEm
           created
           modified
           xMin
           yMin
           xMax
           yMax
           macStyle
           lowestRecPPEM
           fontDirectionHint
           indexToLocFormat
           glyphDataFormat

       The two dates are held as an array of two unsigned longs (32-bits)

METHODS
   $t->read
       Reads the table into memory thanks to some utility functions

   $t->out($fh)
       Writes the table to a file either from memory or by copying. If in
       memory (which is usually) the checkSumAdjustment field is set to 0 as
       per the default if the file checksum is not to be considered.

   $t->minsize()
       Returns the minimum size this table can be. If it is smaller than this,
       then the table must be bad and should be deleted or whatever.

   $t->XML_element($context, $depth, $key, $value)
       Handles date process for the XML exporter

   $t->update
       Updates the head table based on the glyph data and the hmtx table

   $t->getdate($is_create)
       Converts font modification time (or creation time if $is_create is set)
       to a 32-bit integer as returned from time(). Returns undef if the value
       is out of range, either before the epoch or after the maximum storable
       time.

   $t->setdate($time, $is_create)
       Sets the time information for modification (or creation time if
       $is_create is set) according to the 32-bit time information.

BUGS
       None known
