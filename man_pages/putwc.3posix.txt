PUTWC(3POSIX)              POSIX Programmer's Manual             PUTWC(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       putwc — put a wide character on a stream

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdio.h>
       #include <wchar.h>

       wint_t putwc(wchar_t wc, FILE *stream);

DESCRIPTION
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with  the
       ISO C  standard.  Any  conflict between the requirements described here
       and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017
       defers to the ISO C standard.

       The putwc() function shall be equivalent to fputwc(), except that if it
       is implemented as a macro it may evaluate stream more than once, so the
       argument should never be an expression with side-effects.

RETURN VALUE
       Refer to fputwc().

ERRORS
       Refer to fputwc().

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       Since  it may be implemented as a macro, putwc() may treat a stream ar‐
       gument with side-effects  incorrectly.  In  particular,  putwc(wc,*f++)
       need  not work correctly. Therefore, use of this function is not recom‐
       mended; fputwc() should be used instead.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
