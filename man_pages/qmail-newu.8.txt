NAME

qmail-newu -
prepare address assignments for qmail-lspawn

SYNOPSIS

qmail-newu

DESCRIPTION

qmail-newu
reads the assignments in /var/lib/qmail/users/assign
and writes them into /var/lib/qmail/users/cdb in a
binary format suited for quick access by
qmail-lspawn.

If there is a
problem with users/assign, qmail-newu
complains and leaves users/cdb alone.

qmail-newu
ensures that users/cdb is updated atomically, so
qmail-lspawn never has to wait for qmail-newu
to finish. However, qmail-newu makes no attempt to
protect against two simultaneous updates of
users/cdb.

The binary
users/cdb format is portable across machines.
