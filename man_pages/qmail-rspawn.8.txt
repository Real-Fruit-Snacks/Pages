SYNOPSIS

qmail-rspawn

DESCRIPTION

qmail-rspawn
reads a series of remote delivery commands from descriptor
0, invokes qmail-remote to perform the deliveries,
and prints the results to descriptor 1.

qmail-rspawn
invokes qmail-remote asynchronously, so the results
may not be in the same order as the commands.
