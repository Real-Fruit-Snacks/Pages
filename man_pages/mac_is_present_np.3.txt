mac_is_present(const char *policyname);

DESCRIPTION

The mac_is_present_np()
function determines whether the currently-running kernel
supports MAC for a given policy or not. If policyname
is non-NULL, the presence of the named policy (e.g.
&rsquo;&rsquo;biba&rsquo;&rsquo;,
&rsquo;&rsquo;mls&rsquo;&rsquo;,
&rsquo;&rsquo;te&rsquo;&rsquo;) is checked, otherwise the
presence of any MAC policies at all is checked.

RETURN VALUES

If the system supports the given
MAC policy, the value 1 is returned. If the specified MAC
policy is not supported, the value 0 is returned. If an
error occurs, the value &minus;1 is returned.

ERRORS 
[EINVAL]

The value of
policyname is not valid.

[ENOMEM]

Insufficient
memory was available to allocate internal storage.
