NAME

qmail-lspawn -
schedule local deliveries

SYNOPSIS

qmail-lspawn
defaultdelivery

DESCRIPTION

qmail-lspawn
reads a series of local delivery commands from descriptor 0,
invokes qmail-local to perform the deliveries, and
prints the results to descriptor 1. It passes
defaultdelivery to qmail-local as the default
delivery instruction.

qmail-lspawn
invokes qmail-local asynchronously, so the results
may not be in the same order as the commands.

For each
recipient address, qmail-lspawn finds out which local
user controls that address. It first checks the
qmail-users mechanism; if the address is not listed
there, it invokes qmail-getpw. qmail-lspawn
then runs qmail-local under the user&rsquo;s uid and
gid. It does not set up any supplementary groups.

qmail-lspawn
treats an empty mailbox name as a trash address.
