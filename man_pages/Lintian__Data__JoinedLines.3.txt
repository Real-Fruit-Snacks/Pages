NAME
       Lintian::Data::JoinedLines - Lintian interface to query lists of
       keywords

SYNOPSIS
           my $keyword;
           my $list = Lintian::Data::JoinedLines->new('type');
           if ($list->recognizes($keyword)) {
               # do something ...
           }
           my $hash = Lintian::Data::JoinedLines->new('another-type', qr{\s++});
           if ($hash->value($keyword) > 1) {
               # do something ...
           }
           if ($list->value($keyword) > 1) {
               # do something ...
           }
           my @keywords = $list->all;
           if ($list->matches_any($keyword)) {
               # do something ...
           }

DESCRIPTION
       Lintian::Data::JoinedLines provides a way of loading a list of keywords
       or key/value pairs from a file in the Lintian root and then querying
       that list.  The lists are stored in the data directory of the Lintian
       root and consist of one keyword or key/value pair per line.  Blank
       lines and lines beginning with "#" are ignored.  Leading and trailing
       whitespace is stripped.

       If requested, the lines are split into key/value pairs with a given
       separator regular expression.  Otherwise, keywords are taken verbatim
       as they are listed in the file and may include spaces.

       This module allows lists such as menu sections, doc-base sections,
       obsolete packages, package fields, and so forth to be stored in simple,
       easily editable files.

       NB: By default Lintian::Data::JoinedLines is lazy and defers loading of
       the data file until it is actually needed.

   Interface for the CODE argument
       This section describes the interface between for the CODE argument for
       the class method new.

       The sub will be called once for each key/pair with three arguments,
       KEY, VALUE and CURVALUE.  The first two are the key/value pair parsed
       from the data file and CURVALUE is current value associated with the
       key.  CURVALUE will be "undef" the first time the sub is called with
       that KEY argument.

       The sub can then modify VALUE in some way and return the new value for
       that KEY.  If CURVALUE is not "undef", the sub may return "undef" to
       indicate that the current value should still be used.  It is not
       permissible for the sub to return "undef" if CURVALUE is "undef".

       Where Perl semantics allow it, the sub can modify CURVALUE and the
       changes will be reflected in the result.  As an example, if CURVALUE is
       a hashref, new keys can be inserted etc.

INSTANCE METHODS
       dataset
       "keyorder"
       all Returns all keywords listed in the data file as a list in original
           order.  In a scalar context, returns the number of keywords.

       recognizes (KEY)
           Returns true if KEY was listed in the data file represented by this
           Lintian::Data::JoinedLines instance and false otherwise.

       resembles (KEY)
           Returns true if the data file contains a key that is a case-
           insensitive match to KEY, and false otherwise.

       value (KEY)
           Returns the value attached to KEY if it was listed in the data file
           represented by this Lintian::Data::JoinedLines instance and the
           undefined value otherwise.

       matches_any(KEYWORD[, MODIFIERS])
           Returns true if KEYWORD matches any regular expression listed in
           the data file. The optional MODIFIERS serve as modifiers on all
           regexes.

FILES
       LINTIAN_INCLUDE_DIR/data
           The files loaded by this module must be located in this directory.
           Relative paths containing a "/" are permitted, so files may be
           organized in subdirectories in this directory.

           Note that lintian supports multiple LINTIAN_INCLUDE_DIRs.
