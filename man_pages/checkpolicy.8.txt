SYNOPSIS

checkpolicy
[-b[F]] [-C] [-d] [-U handle_unknown (allow,deny,reject)]
[-M] [-c policyvers] [-o output_file|-] [-S] [-t
target_platform (selinux,xen)] [-O] [-E] [-V]
[input_file]

DESCRIPTION

This manual
page describes the checkpolicy command.

checkpolicy
is a program that checks and compiles a SELinux security
policy configuration into a binary representation that can
be loaded into the kernel. If no input file name is
specified, checkpolicy will attempt to read from
policy.conf or policy, depending on whether the -b flag is
specified.

OPTIONS

-b,--binary

Read an existing binary policy
file rather than a source policy.conf file.

-F,--conf

Write policy.conf file rather
than binary policy file. Can only be used with binary policy
file.

-C,--cil

Write CIL policy file rather
than binary policy file.

-d,--debug

Enter debug mode after loading
the policy.

-U,--handle-unknown

Specify how the kernel should
handle unknown classes or permissions (deny, allow or
reject).

-M,--mls

Enable the MLS policy when
checking and compiling the policy.

-c policyvers

Specify the policy version,
defaults to the latest.

-o,--output filename

Write a policy file (binary,
policy.conf, or CIL policy) to the specified filename. If -
is given as filename, write it to standard output.

-S,--sort

Sort ocontexts before writing
out the binary policy. This option makes output of
checkpolicy consistent with binary policies created by
semanage and secilc.

-t,--target

Specify the target platform
(selinux or xen).

-O,--optimize

Optimize the final kernel
policy (remove redundant rules).

-E,--werror

Treat warnings as errors

-V,--version

Show version information.

-h,--help

Show usage information.
