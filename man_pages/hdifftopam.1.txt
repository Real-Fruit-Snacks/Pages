NAME
       hdifftopam - convert horizontal difference image to original PAM image

SYNOPSIS
       hdifftopam[pamfile] [-pnm] [-verbose]

       Minimum  unique abbreviation of option is acceptable.  You may use dou‐
       ble hyphens instead of single hyphen to denote options.   You  may  use
       white space in place of the equals sign to separate an option name from
       its value.

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       hdifftopam undoes what pamtohdiff does.

OPTIONS
       In addition to the options common to all programs  based  on  libnetpbm
       (most notably -quiet, see
        Common Options ⟨index.html#commonoptions⟩ ), hdifftopam recognizes the
       following command line options:

       -pnm
                   This option tells hdifftopam to create a  PNM  image  (i.e.
              PGM or
                   PPM).  Without it, hdifftopam creates a PAM image (with a
                   tuple  type  of  "unhdiff").   If the PAM does not have the
              proper depth
                   to be a PGM or PPM (i.e. 1 or 3) and you specify -pnm,
                   hdifftopam fails.

       -verbose
                   Print output image width, height, depth and maxval to stan‐
              dard error.
