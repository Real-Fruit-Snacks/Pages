HARP(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual HARP(4)

NAME

harp &mdash; pseudo
physical interface driver for HARP

SYNOPSIS

device atm 
options NATM 
options ATM_CORE 
device harp

DESCRIPTION

The harp driver, when
loaded, attaches to all netgraph(4) ATM interfaces in the
system, and for each of these interfaces presents a physical
interface to the HARP stack. The name of the harp
physical interface is the same as the name of the Netgraph
interface (they are in different namespaces).

SEE ALSO

fatm(4), hatm(4), ng_atm(4),
patm(4), atm(8)

CAVEATS

When fatm(4) is used, it must be
started before harp is loaded, to get the correct
configuration for the HARP physical interface.
