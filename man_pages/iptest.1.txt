DESCRIPTION

iptest
...

OPTIONS

&minus;1

Run IP test group #1. This group
of tests generates packets with the IP header fields set to
invalid values given other packet characteristics. The point
tests are: 1 (ip_hl  ip_len), 3
(ip_v  4), 5 (ip_len  packet size, short packets), 7
(Zero length fragments), 8 (packet > 64k after
reassembly), 9 (IP offset with MSB set), 10 (ttl
variations). 

&minus;2

Run IP test group #2. This group of tests generates
packets with the IP options constructed with invalid values
given other packet characteristics. The point tests are: 1
(option length > packet length), 2 (option length =
0). 

&minus;3

Run IP test group #3. This group of tests generates
packets with the ICMP header fields set to non-standard
values. The point tests are: 1 (ICMP types 0-31 & 255),
2 (type 3 & code 0 - 31), 3 (type 4 & code 0, 127,
128, 255), 4 (type 5 & code 0, 127, 128, 255), 5 (types
8-10,13-18 with codes 0, 127, 128 and 255), 6 (type 12 &
code 0, 127, 128, 129, 255) and 7 (type 3 & codes 9-10,
13-14 and 17-18 - shortened packets).

&minus;4

Run IP test group #4. This group of tests generates
packets with the UDP header fields set to non-standard
values. The point tests are: 1 (UDP length > packet
size), 2 (UDP length 

&minus;5

Run IP test group #5. This group of tests generates
packets with the TCP header fields set to non-standard
values. The point tests are: 1 (TCP flags variations, all
combinations), 2 (seq = 0, 0x7fffffff, 0x8000000,
0xa0000000, 0xffffffff), 3 (ack = 0, 0x7fffffff, 0x8000000,
0xa0000000, 0xffffffff), 4 (SYN packet with window of 0,
32768, 65535), 5 (set urgent pointer to 1, 0x7fff, 0x8000,
0xffff), 6 (data offset), 7 (sport = 0, 1, 32767, 32768,
65535) and 8 (dport = 0, 1, 32767, 32768, 65535).

&minus;6

Run IP test group #6. This test generates a large number
of fragments in an attempt to exhaust the network buffers
used for holding packets for later reassembly. WARNING: this
may crash or cause serious performance degradation to the
target host.

&minus;7

Run IP test group #7. This test generates 1024 random IP
packets with only the IP version, checksum, length and IP
offset field correct.

&minus;d

Set the interface name to be
the name supplied.

&minus;g

Specify the hostname of the
gateway through which to route packets. This is required
whenever the destination host isn&rsquo;t directly attached
to the same network as the host from which you&rsquo;re
sending.

&minus;m 

Specify the MTU to be used when
sending out packets. This option allows you to set a fake
MTU, allowing the simulation of network interfaces with
small MTU&rsquo;s without setting them so.

&minus;p

DIAGNOSTICS

Only one of the
numeric test options may be given when iptest is
run.
