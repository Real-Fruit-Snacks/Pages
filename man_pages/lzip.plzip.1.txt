NAME
       plzip - reduces the size of files

SYNOPSIS
       plzip [options] [files]

DESCRIPTION
       Plzip  is a massively parallel (multi-threaded) implementation of lzip,
       fully compatible with lzip 1.4 or newer. Plzip uses the compression li‐
       brary lzlib.

       Lzip is a lossless data compressor with a user interface similar to the
       one of gzip or  bzip2.  Lzip  uses  a  simplified  form  of  the  'Lem‐
       pel-Ziv-Markov  chain-Algorithm'  (LZMA) stream format and provides a 3
       factor integrity checking to  maximize  interoperability  and  optimize
       safety.  Lzip  can compress about as fast as gzip (lzip -0) or compress
       most files more than bzip2 (lzip -9). Decompression speed is intermedi‐
       ate  between gzip and bzip2.  Lzip is better than gzip and bzip2 from a
       data recovery perspective. Lzip has been designed, written, and  tested
       with  great care to replace gzip and bzip2 as the standard general-pur‐
       pose compressed format for unix-like systems.

       Plzip can compress/decompress large files  on  multiprocessor  machines
       much  faster  than  lzip, at the cost of a slightly reduced compression
       ratio (0.4 to 2 percent larger compressed files). Note that the  number
       of  usable  threads is limited by file size; on files larger than a few
       GB plzip can use hundreds of processors, but on files of only a few  MB
       plzip is no faster than lzip.

       -n, --threads=<n>
              set number of (de)compression threads [2]

       -o, --output=<file>
              write to <file>, keep input files

       -q, --quiet
              suppress all messages

       -s, --dictionary-size=<bytes>
              set dictionary size limit in bytes [8 MiB]

       -t, --test
              test compressed file integrity

       -v, --verbose
              be verbose (a 2nd -v gives more)

       -0 .. -9
              set compression level [default 6]

       --fast alias for -0

       --best alias for -9

       --loose-trailing
              allow trailing data seeming corrupt header

       --in-slots=<n>
              number of 1 MiB input packets buffered [4]

       --out-slots=<n>
              number of 1 MiB output packets buffered [64]

       --check-lib
              compare version of lzlib.h with liblz.{a,so}

       If  no  file  names are given, or if a file is '-', plzip compresses or
       decompresses from standard input to standard output.   Numbers  may  be
       followed by a multiplier: k = kB = 10^3 = 1000, Ki = KiB = 2^10 = 1024,
       M = 10^6, Mi = 2^20, G = 10^9, Gi = 2^30, etc...  Dictionary  sizes  12
       to 29 are interpreted as powers of two, meaning 2^12 to 2^29 bytes.

       The  bidimensional  parameter space of LZMA can't be mapped to a linear
       scale optimal for all files. If your files are large, very  repetitive,
       etc,   you   may   need   to  use  the  options  --dictionary-size  and
       --match-length directly to achieve optimal performance.

       To extract all the files from archive 'foo.tar.lz',  use  the  commands
       'tar -xf foo.tar.lz' or 'plzip -cd foo.tar.lz | tar -xf -'.

       Exit  status:  0  for a normal exit, 1 for environmental problems (file
       not found, invalid flags, I/O errors, etc), 2 to indicate a corrupt  or
       invalid  input  file,  3  for an internal consistency error (e.g., bug)
       which caused plzip to panic.
