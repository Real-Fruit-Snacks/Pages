Mouse::Object(3pm)    User Contributed Perl Documentation   Mouse::Object(3pm)

NAME
       Mouse::Object - The base object for Mouse classes

VERSION
       This document describes Mouse version v2.5.10

METHODS
   "$class->new(%args | \%args) -> Object"
       Instantiates a new "Mouse::Object". This is obviously intended for
       subclasses.

   "$class->BUILDARGS(@args) -> HashRef"
       Lets you override the arguments that "new" takes.  It must return a
       HashRef of parameters.

   "$object->BUILDALL(\%args)"
       Calls "BUILD" on each class in the class hierarchy. This is called at
       the end of "new".

   "$object->BUILD(\%args)"
       You may put any business logic initialization in BUILD methods. You
       don't need to redispatch or return any specific value.

   "$object->DEMOLISHALL"
       Calls "DEMOLISH" on each class in the class hierarchy. This is called
       at "DESTROY" time.

   "$object->DEMOLISH"
       You may put any business logic deinitialization in DEMOLISH methods.
       You don't need to redispatch or return any specific value.

   "$object->does($role_name) -> Bool"
       This will check if the invocant's class does a given $role_name.  This
       is similar to "isa" for object, but it checks the roles instead.

   "$object->dump($maxdepth) -> Str"
       This is a handy utility for dumping an object with Data::Dumper.  By
       default, the maximum depth is 3, to avoid making a mess.

   "$object->meta() -> MetaClass"
       This is a method which provides access to the object's metaclass.
