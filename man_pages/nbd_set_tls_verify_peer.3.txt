NAME

nbd_set_tls_verify_peer
- set whether we verify the identity of the server

SYNOPSIS

#include

int nbd_set_tls_verify_peer ( 
struct nbd_handle *h, bool verify 
);

DESCRIPTION

Set this flag
to control whether libnbd will verify the identity of the
server from the server&rsquo;s certificate and the
certificate authority. This defaults to true when connecting
to TCP servers using TLS certificate authentication, and
false otherwise.

This function
may be called regardless of whether TLS is supported, but
will have no effect unless nbd_set_tls(3) is also
used to request or require TLS.

RETURN VALUE

If the call is
successful the function returns 0.

ERRORS

On error -1 is
returned.

Refer to
"ERROR HANDLING" in libnbd(3) for how to
get further details of the error.

The following
parameters must not be NULL: "h". For more
information see "Non-NULL parameters" in
libnbd(3).
