NAME

faxstat -
display Hyla FAX status

SYNOPSIS

faxstat
[ options ]

DESCRIPTION

faxstat
reports the status of Hyla FAX
servers, including (potentially) the status of the send,
receive, done, document, and archive directories. When
invoked without options faxstat reports only the
status of the server; the options described below can be
used to override this behaviour.

Server status
information indicates the state of the server (idle,
sending, receiving, etc.) and the phone number that is
associated with the fax modem.

The job queue
report give the status of facsimile jobs queued for
transmission; by default:

&bull;

the job identifier,

&bull;

the job state (see below for the description of the
a format in the JobFmt string),

&bull;

the modem or modem class the job is bound to
(&rsquo;&rsquo;any&rsquo;&rsquo; if the job can be sent
though any modem),

&bull;

the destination (phone number) of the job,

&bull;

the time to send the job, or a blank field if the job is
being processed or is to be sent immediately,

&bull;

the job&rsquo;s owner,

&bull;

and status information about the job (typically the
reason why a previous attempt failed).

The receive
queue report lists the facsimile documents that have been
received and are awaiting delivery; by default it
includes:

&bull;

the document protection
mode, 

&bull;

the number of pages,

&bull;

the document&rsquo;s owner,

&bull;

the phone number of the sender (if supplied),

&bull;

the date and time at which the job was received, and

&bull;

the filename of the document in the recvq
directory on the server machine.

OPTIONS

-a

Display the contents of the
archive directory on the server machine

-d

Display the status of all jobs that have completed; i.e.
those jobs located in the doneq directory on the
server machine. The JobFmt string defines the content
and format of information reported with this option.

-f

Display the status of document files located in the
docq directory on the server machine. The
FileFmt string defines the content and format of
information reported with this option (see below).

-g

Display times and dates in Greenwich Mean Time (
GMT ). NB: this is the default.

-h host

Report the status of the server on a specific
host. The host may be either a symbolic name
or a network address. If no -h option is supplied,
faxstat uses the FAXSERVER environment
variable to identify the Hyla FAX
server to contact. If this variable is not set, then
faxstat checks for a setting in the configuration
files (first in the per-user file and then in the
system-wide file). If all of the above fails, then
faxstat attempts to contact a server on the machine
where it is run.

-i

Display additional status information for the server as
given by /var/spool/hylafax/status/any.info. This
status typically has information such as the Hyla
FAX version, the physical location of the
server machine, and an administrative contact for the
server. See status(5).

-l

Display times and dates in the local timezone of the
server. 

-r

Display the receive queue status for each server. The
RcvFmt string defines the content and format of
information reported with this option (see below).

-s

Display the status of jobs in the send queue on the
server machine. The JobFmt string defines the content
and format of information reported with this option (see
below). 

-v

Trace the protocol exchanges between faxstat and
the hfaxd processes on the standard output.

CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS

faxstat
reads configuration information from the file
/etc/hylafax/hyla.conf and then from the file
~/.hylarc. Configuration files follow the conventions
described in hylafax-client(1). The following
configuration parameters are recognized:

use is enabled, &rsquo;&rsquo;H&rsquo;&rsquo; if T.30 Annex
C half duplex is enabled, or &rsquo;&rsquo;F&rsquo;&rsquo;
if T.30 Annex C full duplex is enabled.

The N

the system-wide tagline format is to be used or
&rsquo;&rsquo;P&rsquo;&rsquo; if a private tagline format is
to be used.

The O
format produces: &rsquo;&rsquo;N&rsquo;&rsquo; if no
continuation cover page is to be used or &rsquo;&rsquo;
&rsquo;&rsquo; (space) if the system default handling for
continuation cover pages is to be used.

The X
format produces: &rsquo;&rsquo;F&rsquo;&rsquo; for a
facsimile job or &rsquo;&rsquo;P&rsquo;&rsquo; for a pager
job.

The a
format produces: &rsquo;&rsquo;?&rsquo;&rsquo; for a job in
an undefined state, &rsquo;&rsquo;T&rsquo;&rsquo; for a
suspended job (not being scheduled),
&rsquo;&rsquo;P&rsquo;&rsquo; for a pending job (waiting for

concurrent activity to the same destination,
&rsquo;&rsquo;W&rsquo;&rsquo; for a job waiting for
resources such as a free modem,

done and was a success. &rsquo;&rsquo;F&rsquo;&rsquo; for a
job that failed to complete.

The h

chopping is disabled, &rsquo;&rsquo; &rsquo;&rsquo; (space)
for the system default page chop handling,
&rsquo;&rsquo;A&rsquo;&rsquo; when all pages are to be
chopped, or &rsquo;&rsquo;L&rsquo;&rsquo; if only the last
page is to be chopped.

The n
format produces: &rsquo;&rsquo; &rsquo;&rsquo; (space) when
no notification messages are to be delivered,
&rsquo;&rsquo;D&rsquo;&rsquo; when notification is to be
sent when the job is done, &rsquo;&rsquo;Q&rsquo;&rsquo;
when notification is to be sent each time the job is
requeued, or &rsquo;&rsquo;A&rsquo;&rsquo; when notification
is to be sent for either the job completing or being
requeued.

It is
recommended that all items include a field width so that the
width of column title strings can be constrained when
constructing headers from the format string.

ModemFmt

returning modem status information. Formats are specified
using printf(3S)-style conventions but using the
field identifiers listed below. Each item can include field
width, precision, left-justification, 0-filling, etc. just

as for printf; e.g. %-3b for a 3-character wide,
left-justified, blank-padded field containing the signalling
rate.

NOTES

The server
