VIPE(1)                                                                VIPE(1)

NAME
       vipe - edit pipe

SYNOPSIS
       command1 | vipe | command2

DESCRIPTION
       vipe allows you to run your editor in the middle of a unix pipeline and
       edit the data that is being piped between programs. Your editor will
       have the full data being piped from command1 loaded into it, and when
       you close it, that data will be piped into command2.

ARGUMENTS
       vipe takes an argument --suffix that can be used to provide a file
       extension to the temp file generated.  This enables editors to provide
       syntax highlighting and activate modes.  For example, you can call vipe
       like

         vipe --suffix csv

       to create a tempfile with .csv extensions which makes Emacs (or your
       favorite editor) launch in CSV major mode.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       EDITOR
           Editor to use.

       VISUAL
           Also supported to determine what editor to use.
