NAME
       Lintian::Processable::Source::Relation - Lintian interface to source
       package data collection

SYNOPSIS
           my ($name, $type, $dir) = ('foobar', 'source', '/path/to/lab-entry');
           my $collect = Lintian::Processable::Source::Relation->new($name);
           if ($collect->native) {
               print encode_utf8("Package is native\n");
           }

DESCRIPTION
       Lintian::Processable::Source::Relation provides an interface to package
       data for source packages.  It implements data collection methods
       specific to source packages.

       This module is in its infancy.  Most of Lintian still reads all data
       from files in the laboratory whenever that data is needed and generates
       that data via collect scripts.  The goal is to eventually access all
       data about source packages via this module so that the module can cache
       data where appropriate and possibly retire collect scripts in favor of
       caching that data in memory.

INSTANCE METHODS
       binary_relation (PACKAGE, FIELD)
           Returns a Lintian::Relation object for the specified FIELD in the
           binary package PACKAGE in the debian/control file.  FIELD should be
           one of the possible relationship fields of a Debian package or one
           of the following special values:

           All The concatenation of Pre-Depends, Depends, Recommends, and
               Suggests.

           Strong
               The concatenation of Pre-Depends and Depends.

           Weak
               The concatenation of Recommends and Suggests.

           If FIELD isn't present in the package, the returned
           Lintian::Relation object will be empty (present but satisfies
           nothing).

           Any substvars in debian/control will be represented in the returned
           relation as packages named after the substvar.

       saved_binary_relations
       relation (FIELD)
           Returns a Lintian::Relation object for the given build relationship
           field FIELD.  In addition to the normal build relationship fields,
           the following special field names are supported:

           Build-Depends-All
               The concatenation of Build-Depends, Build-Depends-Arch and
               Build-Depends-Indep.

           Build-Conflicts-All
               The concatenation of Build-Conflicts, Build-Conflicts-Arch and
               Build-Conflicts-Indep.

           If FIELD isn't present in the package, the returned
           Lintian::Relation object will be empty (present but satisfies
           nothing).

       saved_relation
       relation_norestriction (FIELD)
           The same as "relation (FIELD)", but ignores architecture
           restrictions and build profile restrictions in the FIELD field.
