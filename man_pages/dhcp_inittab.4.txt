NAME

dhcp_inittab
− information repository for DHCP options

DESCRIPTION

The
/etc/dhcp/inittab file contains information about the
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) options,
which are network configuration parameters passed from
DHCP servers to DHCP clients when a client
machine uses DHCP. Since many DHCP-related
commands must parse and understand these DHCP
options, this file serves as a central location where
information about these options may be obtained.

The DHCP
inittab file provides three general pieces of
information:

•

A mnemonic alias, or symbol name, for each option
number. For instance, option 12 is aliased to the name
Hostname. This is useful for DHCP-related
programs that require human interaction, such as
dhcpinfo(1). 

•

Information about the syntax for each option. This
includes information such as the type of the value, for
example, whether it is a 16-bit integer or an IP
address. 

•

The policy for what options are visible to which
DHCP-related programs.

The
dhcp_inittab file can only be changed upon system
upgrade. Only additions of SITE options (or changes
to same) will be preserved during upgrade.

The
VENDOR options defined here are intended for use by
the Solaris DHCP client and DHCP management
tools. The SUNW vendor space is owned by Sun, and
changes are likely during upgrade. If you need to configure
the Solaris DHCP server to support the vendor options
of a different client, see dhctab(4) for details.

Each
DHCP option belongs to a certain category, which
roughly defines the scope of the option; for instance, an
option may only be understood by certain hosts within a
given site, or it may be globally understood by all
DHCP clients and servers. The following categories
are defined; the category names are not case-sensitive:

STANDARD

All client and server
DHCP implementations agree on the semantics. These
are administered by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
(IANA). These options are numbered from 1 to
127.

SITE

Within a specific site, all client and server
implementations agree on the semantics. However, at another
site the type and meaning of the option may be quite
different. These options are numbered from 128 to 254.

VENDOR

Each vendor may define 254
options unique to that vendor. The vendor is identified
within a DHCP packet by the "Vendor Class"
option, number 60. An option with a specific numeric
identifier belonging to one vendor will, in general, have a
type and semantics different from that of a different
vendor. Vendor options are "super-encapsulated"
into the vendor field number 43, as defined in RFC
2132. The dhcp_inittab file only contains Sun
vendor options. Define non-Sun vendor options in the
dhcptab file.

FIELD

This category allows the fixed fields within a
DHCP packet to be aliased to a mnemonic name for use
with dhcpinfo(1).

INTERNAL

This category is internal to
the Solaris DHCP implementation and will not be
further defined.

DHCP inittab
Format 
Data entries are written one per line and have seven fields;
each entry provides information for one option. Each field
is separated by a comma, except for the first and second,
which are separated by whitespace (as defined in
isspace(3C)). An entry cannot be continued onto
another line. Blank lines and those whose first
non-whitespace character is ’#’ are ignored.

The fields, in
order, are:

•

Mnemonic Identifier

The Mnemonic
Identifier is a user-friendly alias for the option number;
it is not case sensitive. This field must be per-category
unique and should be unique across all categories. The
option names in the STANDARD, SITE, and
VENDOR spaces should not overlap, or the behavior
will be undefined. See Mnemonic Identifiers for
Options section of this man page for descriptions of the
option names.

•

Category (scope)

The Category
field is one of STANDARD, SITE, VENDOR,
FIELD, or INTERNAL and identifies the scope in
which the option falls.

•

Option Number

The Option
Number is the number of this option when it is in a
DHCP packet. This field should be per-category unique
and the STANDARD and SITE fields should not
have overlapping code fields or the behavior is
undefined.

•

Data Type

Data Type is
one of the following values, which are not case
sensitive:

Ascii

A printable character string

Bool

Has no value. Scope limited to category limited to
INTERNAL. Presence of an option of this type within a
Solaris configuration file represents TRUE, absence
represents FALSE.

Octet

An array of bytes

Unumber8

An 8-bit unsigned integer

Snumber8

An 8-bit signed integer

Unumber16

A 16-bit unsigned integer

Snumber16

A 16-bit signed integer

Unumber32

A 32-bit unsigned integer

Snumber32

A 32-bit signed integer

Unumber64

A 64-bit unsigned integer

Snumber64

A 64-bit signed integer

Ip

An IP address

The data type
field describes an indivisible unit of the option payload,
using one of the values listed above.

•

Granularity

The Granularity
field describes how many "indivisible units" in
the option payload make up a whole value or item for this
option. The value must be greater than zero (0) for
any data type other than Bool, in which case it must be zero
(0).

•

Maximum Number Of Items

This value
specifies the maximum items of Granularity which are
permissible in a definition using this symbol. For example,
there can only be one IP address specified for a subnet
mask, so the Maximum number of items in this case is one
(1). A Maximum value 
of zero (0) means that a variable number of items is
permitted.

•

Visibility

The Visibility
field specifies which DHCP-related programs make use
of this information, and should always be defined as
"sdmi" for newly added options.

Mnemonic
Identifiers for Options 
The following table maps the mnemonic identifiers used in
Solaris DHCP to RFC 2132 options:

EXAMPLES

Example 1:
Altering the DHCP inittab File

In general, the
DHCP inittab file should only be altered to add
SITE options. If other options are added, they will
not be automatically carried forward when the system is
upgraded. For instance:

ipPairs    SITE, 132, IP, 2, 0, sdmi

describes an
option named ipPairs, that is in the SITE
category. That is, it is defined by each individual site,
and is option code 132, which is of type IP Address,
consisting of a potentially infinite number of pairs of
IP addresses.
