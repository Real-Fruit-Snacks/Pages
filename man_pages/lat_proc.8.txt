NAME

lat_proc -
process creation tests

SYNOPSIS

lat_proc
[ -P  ] [ -W
 ] [ -N  ]
procedure|fork|exec|shell

DESCRIPTION

lat_proc
creates processes in three different forms, each more
expensive than the last. The purposes is to measure the time
that it takes to create a basic thread of control.

The forms are
listed and described below:

Process fork+exit

The time it takes to split a process into two (nearly)
identical copies and have one exit. This is how new
processes are created but is not very useful since both
processes are doing the same thing.

Process fork+execve

The time it takes to create a new process and have that
new process run a new program. This is the inner loop of all
shells (command interpreters).

Process fork+/bin/sh -c

The time it takes to create a
new process and have that new process run a new program by
asking the system shell to find that program and run it.
This is how the C library interface called system is
implemented. It is the most general and the most
expensive.

OUTPUT

Output is in
microseconds per operation like so:

Process
fork+exit: 6054 microseconds 
Process fork+execve: 11212 microseconds 
Process fork+/bin/sh -c: 44346 microseconds
