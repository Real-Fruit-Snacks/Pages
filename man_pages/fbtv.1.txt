NAME

fbtv - a
console program for watching TV

SYNOPSIS

fbtv [
options ] [ station name ]

DESCRIPTION

fbtv is
a program for watching TV with your linux box. It runs on
top of a graphic framebuffer device (/dev/fb0).
You&rsquo;ll need a kernel newer than 2.1.x to play with
this. fbtv shares the config file
($HOME/.xawtv) with the xawtv application.
Check the xawtv(1) manpage for details about the
config file format.

OPTIONS

-h

Display a command line options
summary. 

-o base

set base string for the
snapshot output files. The filename will be
base-timestamp-nr.ext.

-v

Be verbose.

-c device

video4linux device (default is
/dev/video0).

-D driver

video4linux driver (default is
libv4l).

-d device

framebuffer device (default is
$FRAMEBUFFER; /dev/fb0 if unset)

-g

grayscaled display (works for 256 color mode only)

-s
widthxheight

sets the V4L2 capture in
width x height resolution if possible.

-f font

font for text. Default is to
look for lat1-16 console font. It no path is
specified, it will seek for the font at the following
directories:

/usr/share/consolefonts/

/usr/share/kbd/consolefonts/ 
/usr/lib/kbd/consolefonts/ 
/lib/kbd/consolefonts/

If you have a
local X11 font server running (or the FONTSERVER
environment variable set to some working server), you can
also give X11 font specs here.

-m mode

video mode for TV. fbtv
will look up the mode in /etc/fb.modes.

-j joydev

joystick device to use for
controlling fbtv.

-k

keep capture on when switching consoles. Might be useful
together with -s switch, you have a video picture while
working on another console. This is more or less a dirty
hack. Works only if all your consoles have the same video
mode and fbcon does not use panning to speed up scrolling.
For a multiheaded setup this is useful too.

-q

quiet mode. Doesn&rsquo;t reserve space for the status
line at the top, doesn&rsquo;t display the status messages
and clock. When fbtv is started on this mode, it
won&rsquo;t try to load the font file at start.

You can toggle
this at runtime too (using the &rsquo;F&rsquo;
key).

-M

EXPERIMENTAL: Turn on backend
scaler mode (write yuv to offscreen memory and let the gfx
board scale up the video). Supported hardware: Matrox
G200/G400 (with matroxfb) and ATI Mach64 VT/GT (with atyfb,
16bpp only). You&rsquo;ll need at least bttv-0.7.16 or
kernel 2.3.50.

USAGE

fbtv is
supported to work much like xawtv from user&rsquo;s
point of view. You might have noticed that xawtv has
a lot of keyboard shortcuts. They work in fbtv too
(if it useful). Here is the list:

G Grab
picture (full size, ppm) 
J Grab picture (full size, jpeg) 
F Fullscreen. Toggle quiet mode (see above).

up/down
tune up/down one channel 
left/right fine tuning 
pgup/pgdown station up/down

ESC,Q
Quit 
X Quit, but leave sound on.

+/-
Volume up/down 
Enter mute

The channel
hotkeys defined in $HOME/.xawtv are supported too,
with one exception: modifier keys (something like
"key = Ctrl+F1") do not work.

FULLSCREEN TV

Some hints from
Dag Bakke dag.bakke [AT] riksnett.no>:

The BT8xx cards
can produce images up to 768x576 pixels. In order to have
fbtv make use of your entire monitor-size and get
maximum image quality, you need to create a 768x576 pixels
framebufferconsole. This can be accomplished with the
fbset(1) utility, which is available at various
locations. See: http://www.cs.kuleuven.ac.be/~geert/bin/

Or, you can let
fbtv handle the videomode changes with the -m switch.
This requires that you have a small database with the
various videomodes available. The file containing the
videomodes is normally named /etc/fb.modes. For
example, the following entry produces a 768x576x32bpp mode,
with 75Hz refresh on a Matrox G200.

mode
"tv" 
# D: 49.188 MHz, H: 46.580 kHz, V: 75.008 Hz 
geometry 768 576 768 576 32 
timings 20330 128 32 32 8 128 5 
endmode

The command
"fbtv -q -mtv" thus gives you crisp clear
(well, as good as the received signal anyway) tv on your
entire screen. Alias this command to
&rsquo;tv&rsquo;, and you&rsquo;re set.

NB!
Please note that your monitor may or may not be able to
handle such a "custom" resolution. And that misuse
of the aforementioned fbset utility can toast your monitor.
It is a lot easier to pull smoke out of electronic
components, than to put it back in.

A database of
the standard VESA-modes can be downloaded from:
ftp://platan.vc.cvut.cz/pub/linux/matrox-latest/fb.modes.vesa60.gz
