DESCRIPTION

transmission-daemon is a
daemon-based Transmission session that can be controlled via
RPC commands from transmission&rsquo;s web interface or
transmission-remote(1).

OPTIONS 
-a --allowed x.x.x.x,...

Allow RPC access to a
comma-delimited whitelist of IP addresses. Wildcards can be
specified in an address by using &rsquo;*&rsquo;. Default:
"127.0.0.1,::1" Example:
"127.0.0.*,192.168.1.*"

-b --blocklist

Enable peer blocklists.
Transmission understands the bluetack blocklist file format.
New blocklists can be added by copying them into the
config-dir&rsquo;s "blocklists" subdirectory.

-c directory

Directory to watch for new
.torrent files to be added. As they are added to this
directory, the daemon will load them into Transmission.

-C

Do not watch
for new .torrent files.

-B --no-blocklist

Disable blocklists.

-d

Dump
transmission-daemon&rsquo;s settings to stderr.

-f --foreground

Run in the foreground and print
errors to stderr.

-g --config-dir
directory

Where to look for configuration
files. This can be used to swap between using the cli,
daemon, gtk, and qt clients. See
https://github.com/transmission/transmission/blob/main/docs/Configuration-Files.md
for more information.

-er
--encryption-required

Encrypt all peer
connections.

-ep
--encryption-preferred

Prefer encrypted peer
connections.

-et
--encryption-tolerated

Prefer unencrypted peer
connections.

-gsr --global-seedratio
ratio

All torrents, unless overridden
by a per-torrent setting, should seed until a specific
ratio

-GSR
--no-global-seedratio

All torrents, unless overridden
by a per-torrent setting, should seed regardless of
ratio

-h --help

Print command-line option
descriptions.

--incomplete-dir
dir

When adding new torrents, store
their contents in directory until the torrent is
done.

--no-incomplete-dir

Don&rsquo;t store incomplete
torrents in a different directory.

-i

connections on a specific address. Only one IPv4 listening
address is allowed. Default: 0.0.0.0 (All addresses)

connections on a specific address. Only one IPv6 listening
address is allowed. Default: :: (All addresses)

-r --rpc-bind-address

authentication from clients.

authentication.

-v --password
