AXE(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual AXE(4)

NAME

axe — ASIX
Electronics AX88x7x/760 USB Ethernet driver

SYNOPSIS

To compile this driver into the
kernel, place the following lines in your kernel
configuration file:

device ehci

device uhci 
device ohci 
device usb 
device miibus 
device uether 
device axe

Alternatively,
to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following line in loader.conf(5):

if_axe_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION

The axe driver provides
support for USB Ethernet adapters based on the ASIX
Electronics AX88172, AX88178, AX88772, AX88772A, AX88772B
and AX88760 USB 2.0 chipsets.

The AX88172,
AX88772, AX88772A, AX88772B and AX88760 contain a 10/100
Ethernet MAC with MII interface and are designed to work
with both Ethernet and HomePNA transceivers. The AX88178 has
a 10/100/1000 Ethernet MAC with GMII/RGMII interface for
interfacing with Gigabit Ethernet PHY.

These devices
will operate with both USB 1.x and USB 2.0 controllers,
however performance with 1.x controllers will be limited
since the USB 1.x standard specifies a maximum transfer
speed of 12Mbps. Users with USB 1.x controllers should
therefore not expect to actually achieve 100Mbps speeds with
these devices.

All chipsets
support a 64-bit multicast hash table, single perfect filter
entry for the station address, all-multicast mode and
promiscuous mode. Packets are received and transmitted over
separate USB bulk transfer endpoints.

The axe
driver supports the following media types:

autoselect

Enable
autoselection of the media type and options. The user can
manually override the autoselected mode by adding media
options to rc.conf(5).

10baseT/UTP

Set 10Mbps
operation. The ifconfig(8) mediaopt option can also
be used to select either full-duplex or
half-duplex modes.

100baseTX

Set 100Mbps
(Fast Ethernet) operation. The ifconfig(8) mediaopt
option can also be used to select either full-duplex
or half-duplex modes.

1000baseT

Set 1000Mbps
(Gigabit Ethernet) operation (AX88178 only). The ifconfig(8)
mediaopt option can also be used to select either
full-duplex or half-duplex modes.

The axe
driver supports the following media options:

full-duplex

Force full
duplex operation.

half-duplex

Force half
duplex operation.

For more
information on configuring this device, see ifconfig(8).

DIAGNOSTICS

axe%d: watchdog
timeout  A packet was queued for transmission and a
transmit command was issued, however the device failed to
acknowledge the transmission before a timeout expired.

axe%d: no
memory for rx list  The driver failed to allocate
an mbuf for the receiver ring.
