MACLABEL(7) BSD Miscellaneous Information Manual
MACLABEL(7)

NAME

maclabel &mdash;
Mandatory Access Control label format

DESCRIPTION

If Mandatory Access Control, or
MAC, is enabled in the kernel, then in addition to the
traditional credentials, each subject (typically a user or a
socket) and object (file system object, socket, etc.) is
given a MAC label. The MAC label specifies the
necessary subject-specific or object-specific information
necessary for a MAC security policy to enforce access
control on the subject/object.

The format for a
MAC label is defined as follows:

policy1/qualifier1,policy2/qualifier2,...

A MAC label
consists of a policy name, followed by a forward slash,
followed by the subject or object&rsquo;s qualifier,
optionally followed by a comma and one or more additional
policy labels. For example:

biba/low(low-low)

biba/high(low-high),mls/equal(equal-equal),partition/0
