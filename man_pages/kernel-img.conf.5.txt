KERNEL-IMG.CONF(5)          Debian GNU/Linux manual         KERNEL-IMG.CONF(5)

NAME
       kernel-img.conf - configuration file for Linux kernel packages

SYNOPSIS
       /etc/kernel-img.conf

DESCRIPTION
       The  file  /etc/kernel-img.conf is used by the kernel package installa‐
       tion and removal process to allow local options for handling  some  as‐
       pects  of the installation.  Most configuration variables apply only to
       kernel image packages.

       Not all kernel image package creators support this  file,  or  all  the
       configuration variables.  Support status for the file itself is:

       Package creator               Status
       Debian linux source package   supported
       Ubuntu linux source package   supported
       kernel-package                supported
       make deb-pkg                  ignored

       The  format  of the file is a simple VAR=VALUE pair. Boolean values may
       be specified as Yes, True, 1, and No, False, 0, and are  case  insensi‐
       tive.  This file is automatically created by the installation script in
       certain circumstances.

       At the moment, the user modifiable variables supported are:

       do_symlinks
              If set, the postinst and postrm scripts will  maintain  symlinks
              to   default  kernel  and  initramfs  images,  as  described  in
              linux-update-symlinks(8).  This variable is set by default.

              Package creator               Status
              Debian linux source package   supported
              Ubuntu linux source package   supported
              kernel-package                ignored since v12.001;
                                            previously supported

       image_dest
              Set this variable to the directory in which symlinks to the  de‐
              fault kernel and initramfs images should be maintained.  The de‐
              fault value is /.

              Package creator               Status
              Debian linux source package   supported

                                            previously supported

       link_in_boot
              If set, this has the same effect as image_dest = /boot and over‐
              rides  any  other setting of image_dest.  This variable is unset
              by default.

       postinst_hook
              DEPRECATED: Set this variable to a script to be executed  during
              installation.  The  path  can  be  a relative path if the script
              lives in a safe path -- that is, if it  lives  in  /bin,  /sbin,
              /usr/bin, or /usr/sbin, or must be an absolute path instead. Be‐
              fore calling this script, the environment variable STEM shall be
              set  to  the value of the --stem argument (or the default value,
              linux), and in packages created by  kernel-package  KERNEL_PACK‐
              AGE_VERSION  shall  be  set to the version of the kernel-package
              that created the package.  This script shall be called with  two
              arguments,  the first being the version of the kernel image, and
              the second argument being the location of the kernel  image  it‐
              self.  Errors  in  the  script shall cause the postinst to fail.
              Since debconf is in use before the script is called, this script
              should  issue  no  diagnostic  messages  to  stdout -- while the
              postinst does call db_stop, debconf does not restore stdout,  so
              messages  to stdout disappear.  An example script for grub users
              is present in  /usr/share/doc/kernel-package/  directory.   This
              script is run after the scripts in /etc/kernel/postinst.d direc‐
              tory.

       postrm_hook
              DEPRECATED: Set this variable to a script to be executed in  the
              postrm (that is, after the image has been removed) after all the
              remove actions have been performed. The path can be  a  relative
              path  if the script lives in a safe path -- that is, if it lives
              in /bin, /sbin, /usr/bin, or /usr/sbin, or must be  an  absolute
              path  instead.  In packages created by kernel-package, the envi‐
              ronment variable KERNEL_PACKAGE_VERSION shall be set to the ver‐
              sion of the kernel-package that created the package. This script
              shall be called with two arguments, the first being the  version
              of  the kernel image, and the second argument being the location
              of the kernel image itself. Errors in the script shall produce a
              warning  message,  but shall be otherwise ignored. Since debconf
              is in use before the script is called, this script should  issue
              no  diagnostic  messages  to  stdout --  while the postinst does
              call db_stop, debconf does not restore stdout,  so  messages  to
              stdout  disappear.   This  script  is  run  after the scripts in
              /etc/kernel/postrm.d directory.

       preinst_hook
              DEPRECATED: Set this variable to a script to be executed  before
              the  package  is  unpacked, and can be used to put in additional
              checks. The path can be a relative path if the script lives in a
              safe  path  -- that is, if it lives in /bin, /sbin, /usr/bin, or
              /usr/sbin, or must be an absolute path instead. In packages cre‐
              ated  by  kernel-package,  the environment variable KERNEL_PACK‐
              AGE_VERSION shall be set to the version  of  the  kernel-package
              that  created  the package. This script shall be called with two
              arguments, the first being the version of the kernel image,  and
              the  second  argument being the location of the kernel image it‐
              self.  This script is run after the scripts in  /etc/kernel/pre‐

       prerm_hook
              DEPRECATED:  Set this variable to a script to be executed before
              the package files are removed (so any added  files  may  be  re‐
              moved)  . The path can be a relative path if the script lives in
              a safe path -- that is, if it lives in /bin, /sbin, /usr/bin, or
              /usr/sbin, or must be an absolute path instead. In packages cre‐
              ated by kernel-package, the  environment  variable  KERNEL_PACK‐
              AGE_VERSION  shall  be  set to the version of the kernel-package

              the second argument being the location of the kernel  image  it‐

       src_postinst_hook
              DEPRECATED: Unlike the other hook variables, this is meant for a
              script  run  during the post inst of a docs, headers or a source
              package. Using this hook for the headers package  is  now  being
              deprecated,  at some point the headers post install script shall
              only run the header_postinst_hook.  The path can be  a  relative
              path  if the script lives in a safe path -- that is, if it lives
              in /bin, /sbin, /usr/bin, or /usr/sbin, or must be  an  absolute
              path  instead.  The  environment variable KERNEL_PACKAGE_VERSION
              shall be set to the version of the kernel-package  that  created
              the  package.   This  script shall be called with two arguments,
              the first being the name of the package being  installed  (could
              be  kernel source or headers), and the second argument being the
              version of the package being installed.  Errors  in  the  script
              shall  cause the postinst to fail.  This script is run after the

       header_postinst_hook
              DEPRECATED: Unlike the other hook variables, this is meant for a
              script  run  during the post inst of a headers package only. The
              path can be a relative path if the script lives in a  safe  path
              --  that is, if it lives in /bin, /sbin, /usr/bin, or /usr/sbin,
              or must be an absolute path instead. In packages created by ker‐
              nel-package,  the  environment  variable  KERNEL_PACKAGE_VERSION
              shall be set to the version of the kernel-package  that  created
              the package. This script shall be called with two arguments, the
              first being the name of the package  being  installed,  and  the
              second  argument  being  the  version  of  the package being in‐
              stalled. Errors in the script shall cause the postinst to  fail.
              This   script   is   run   after   the   scripts   in  /etc/ker‐
              nel/header_postinst.d directory.

       clobber_modules
              If set, the preinst shall silently try to move /lib/modules/ver‐
              sion out of the way if it is the same version as the image being
              installed. Use at your own risk.  This variable is unset by  de‐

       warn_reboot
              This variable can be used to turn off the warning given when in‐
              stalling a kernel image which is the same version  as  the  cur‐
              rently running version. If the modules list is changed, the mod‐
              ules dependencies may have been changed, and the modules for the
              new  kernel  may  not run correctly on the running kernel if the
              kernel ABI has changed in the meanwhile. It is a  good  idea  to
              reboot,  and  this is a note to remind you. If you know what you
              are doing, you can set this variable to no. This variable is set
              by default.

       relink_build_link
              This  option  manipulates  the build link created by recent ker‐
              nels. If the link is a dangling link, and if a the corresponding
              kernel  headers  appear  to have been installed on the system, a
              new symlink shall be created to point to them. The default is to
              relink the build link (YES).

       silent_modules
              This  option has been put in for the people who are vastly irri‐
              tated  on  being  warned  about  preexisting  modules  directory
              /lib/modules/$version.   That  directory may belong to an old or
              defunct kernel image package, in which case problems  may  arise
              with  leftover  modules in that directory tree, or the directory
              may legitimately exist due to a independent modules package  be‐
              ing  installed for this kernel version that has already been un‐
              packed.  In this latter case the existence of the  directory  is
              benign.   If you set this variable, you shall no longer be given
              a chance to abort if a preexisting modules  directory  /lib/mod‐
              ules/$version is detected.  This is unset by default.
