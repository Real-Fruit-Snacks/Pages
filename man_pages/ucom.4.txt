UCOM(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual UCOM(4)

NAME

ucom &mdash; USB tty
support

SYNOPSIS

To compile this driver into the
kernel, place the following line in your kernel
configuration file:

device
ucom

Alternatively,
to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following line in loader.conf(5):

ucom_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION

The ucom driver attaches
to USB modems, serial ports, and other devices that need to
look like a tty. The ucom driver shows a behavior
like a tty(4). This means that normal programs such as
tip(1) or ppp(8) can be used to access the device.

SYSCTL VARIABLES

The following variables are
available as both sysctl(8) variables and loader(8)
tunables:

hw.usb.ucom.debug

Debug output level, where 0 is
debugging disabled and larger values increase debug message
verbosity. Default is 0.

hw.usb.ucom.device_mode_console

When set to 1, the ucom
driver will mark terminals as console devices when operating
in device mode. Default is 1.

hw.usb.ucom.pps_mode

Enables and configure PPS
capture mode as described below.

Pulse Per Second (PPS) Timing
Interface

The ucom driver can
capture PPS timing information as defined in RFC 2783. The
API, accessed via ioctl(2), is available on the tty device.
To use the PPS capture feature with ntpd(8), symlink the tty
device to /dev/pps0.

The
hw.usb.ucom.pps_mode sysctl configures the PPS
capture mode. It can be set in loader.conf(5) or
sysctl.conf(5). The following capture modes are
available:

0

Capture
disabled (default).

1

Capture pulses
on the CTS line.

2

Capture pulses
on the DCD line.

HISTORY

The ucom driver was
adopted from NetBSD in March of 2002. This manual page was
adopted from NetBSD by Tom Rhodes
trhodes [AT] FreeBSD.org> in April 2002.

BUGS

Prior to FreeBSD 6.0
ucom created /dev/ucom? rather than the
uniform device names created today. Old scripts must be
adjusted accordingly.
