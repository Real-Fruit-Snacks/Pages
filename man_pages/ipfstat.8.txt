NAME

ipfstat &minus;
reports on packet filter statistics and filter list

SYNOPSIS

ipfstat
[ &minus;6aAfghIinosv ] [ &minus;d
 ]

ipfstat
-t [ &minus;C ] [ &minus;D
 ] [ &minus;P  ] [
&minus;S  ] [ &minus;T
 ] [ &minus;d 
]

DESCRIPTION

ipfstat
examines /dev/kmem using the symbols _fr_flags,
_frstats, _filterin, and _filterout. To
run and work, it needs to be able to read both /dev/kmem and
the kernel itself. The kernel name defaults to
/kernel.

The default
behaviour of ipfstat is to retrieve and display the
accumulated statistics which have been accumulated over time
as the kernel has put packets through the filter.

OPTIONS

&minus;6

Display filter lists for IPv6,
if available.

&minus;a

Display the accounting filter list and show bytes
counted against each rule.

&minus;A

Display packet authentication statistics.

&minus;C

This option is only valid in combination with
&minus;t. Display "closed" states as well
in the top. Normally, a TCP connection is not displayed when
it reaches the CLOSE_WAIT protocol state. With this option
enabled, all state entries are displayed.

&minus;d

Use a device other than
/dev/ipl for interfacing with the kernel.

&minus;D

This option is only valid in
combination with &minus;t. Limit the state top
display to show only state entries whose destination IP
address and port match the addport argument. The addrport
specification is of the form ipaddress[,port]. The ipaddress
and port should be either numerical or the string
"any" (specifying any IP address resp. any port).
If the &minus;D option is not specified, it defaults
to "&minus;D any,any".

&minus;f

Show fragment state information (statistics) and held
state information (in the kernel) if any is present.

&minus;g

Show groups currently configured (both active and
inactive). 

&minus;h

Show per-rule the number of times each one scores a
"hit". For use in combination with
&minus;i. 

&minus;i

Display the filter list used for the input side of the
kernel IP processing.

&minus;I

Swap between retrieving
"inactive"/"active" filter list details.
For use in combination with &minus;i.

&minus;n

Show the "rule number" for each rule as it is
printed. 

&minus;o

Display the filter list used for the output side of the
kernel IP processing.

&minus;P

This option is only valid in
combination with &minus;t. Limit the state top
display to show only state entries that match a specific
protocol. The argument can be a protocol name (as defined in
/etc/protocols) or a protocol number. If this option
is not specified, state entries for any protocol are
specified.

&minus;s

Show packet/flow state information (statistics
only). 

&minus;sl

Show held state information (in the kernel) if any is
present (no statistics).

&minus;S

This option is only valid in
combination with &minus;t. Limit the state top
display to show only state entries whose source IP address
and port match the addport argument. The addrport
specification is of the form ipaddress[,port]. The ipaddress
and port should be either numerical or the string
"any" (specifying any ip address resp. any port).
If the &minus;S option is not specified, it defaults
to "&minus;S any,any".

&minus;t

Show the state table in a way similar to they way
top(1) shows the process table. States can be sorted
using a number of different ways. This options requires
ncurses(3) and needs to be compiled in. It may not be
available on all operating systems. See below, for more
information on the keys that can be used while ipfstat is in
top mode.

&minus;T

This option is only valid in
combination with &minus;t. Specifies how often the
state top display should be updated. The refresh time is the
number of seconds between an update. Any positive integer
can be used. The default (and minimal update time) is 1.

&minus;v

Turn verbose mode on. Displays more debugging
information. 

SYNOPSIS

The role of
ipfstat is to display current kernel statistics
gathered as a result of applying the filters in place (if
any) to packets going in and out of the kernel. This is the
default operation when no command line parameters are
present.

When supplied
with either &minus;i or &minus;o, it will
retrieve and display the appropriate list of filter rules
currently installed and in use by the kernel.

STATE TOP

Using the
&minus;t option ipfstat will enter the state
top mode. In this mode the state table is displayed similar
to the way top displays the process table. The
&minus;C, &minus;D, &minus;P,
&minus;S and &minus;T command line options can
be used to restrict the state entries that will be shown and
to specify the frequency of display updates.

In state top
mode, the following keys can be used to influence the
displayed information: 
d select information to display. 
l redraw the screen. 
q quit the program. 
s switch between different sorting criterion. 
r reverse the sorting criterion.

States can be
sorted by protocol number, by number of IP packets, by
number of bytes and by time-to-live of the state entry. The
default is to sort by the number of bytes. States are sorted
in descending order, but you can use the r key to
sort them in ascending order.

STATE TOP LIMITATIONS

It is currently
not possible to interactively change the source, destination
and protocol filters or the refresh frequency. This must be
done from the command line.

The screen must
have at least 80 columns. This is however not checked.

Only the first
X-5 entries that match the sort and filter criteria are
displayed (where X is the number of rows on the display.
There is no way to see more entries.

No support for
IPv6
