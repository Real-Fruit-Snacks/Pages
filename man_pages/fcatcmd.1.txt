NAME

fcatcmd, fcat
− copy files in the FSP database to stdout

SYNOPSIS

fcatcmd
[-r] filename ...

fcat
[-r] filename ...

DESCRIPTION

For each file
named in the argument list, fcatcmd reads the file
and writes the content of the file to its stdout.

fcatcmd
will perform csh file name globbing based on file and
directory information obtained from the FSP database.

Since
user’s command shells generally cannot do the proper
globbing for this program, it is recommended that user
defines a shell alias or function to turn off command shell
globbing before running this program. csh
example:

alias fcat
\(set noglob\; exec fcatcmd \!\*\)

ARGUMENTS

-r --
forces fcatcmd to recursively show all files in given
directories.

ENVIRONMENT

See fsp_env(7)
for list of used environment variables.
