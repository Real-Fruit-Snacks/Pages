NAME

rcvtty - report
new mail with nmh

SYNOPSIS

/usr/lib/mh/rcvtty

[-help] [-version]
[command] [-form formatfile]

[-format string]
[-width columns] [-bell |
-nobell] [-newline | -nonewline]
[-biff]

DESCRIPTION

The
rcvtty command can be used to report new mail. It is
used primarily in conjunction with mail filtering agents
such as slocal or procmail.

rcvtty
executes the named command with the message as its standard
input, and writes the resulting output on your terminal.

Alternatively,
if no command is specified (or the command is bogus), then
rcvtty will instead write a one-line scan listing.
The default output format of this scan listing may be
overridden by using either the -form
formatfile or -format string option,
similar to the equivalent options for scan and
inc. See mh-format(5) for details.

A newline is
output before the message output, and the terminal bell is
rung after the output. The -nonewline and
-nobell switches will inhibit these functions.

The switch
-width columns may be given to specify the
width of the scan line. The default is to use the width of
the terminal.

In addition to
the standard format escapes described in
mh-format(5), rcvtty also recognizes the
following additional component escapes:

Escape

Returns

Description

body

string

the (compressed) first part of the body

dtimenow

date

the current date

folder

string

the name of the current folder

By default,
rcvtty will send its output to every terminal on the
local machine that is owned by current user, and that has
given write permission as granted by the command
mesg(1). If the option -biff is given, then
rcvtty will obey the notification status set by the
command biff(1) instead.

codes are meaningful, others should be.
