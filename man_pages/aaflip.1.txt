NAME

aaflip - An
ASCII art video player

SYNOPSIS

aaflip
[-abcfv] [-n number] [-s
delay]

DESCRIPTION

aaflip
is an ASCII art video player which supports the fli and flc
formats.

fli files are
limited to a resolution of 320x200 pixel, while flc files
can have any resolution.

The default
method of playing is to load the first frame of the
animation sequence and display it. After this the remainder
of the file is loaded into memory, and the animation starts.
The animation ends when q or ctrl-c is pressed.

OPTIONS

-a

Remove frames from memory after
processing. Using this option leaves more memory for other
processes, but relies on the buffer cache for continuous
animation. 

-b

Process frames immediately as they are loaded. When
using this option the animation frames are shown as soon as
the player has read them, so you don&rsquo;t have to wait
until the entire file has been read. The disadvantage is
that the animation becomes jumpy if the speed set by the
animation is higher than the speed of loading.

-c

Keep the screen black while loading the animation. This
conflicts with option -b, which can give interesting
results. 

-f

Switch off clock synchronization. Animation will run as
fast as possible.

-v

Show information on flic file.

-n number

Play the animation sequence
number times.

-s delay

Set delay between frames to
delay milliseconds. Option -s 0 is the same as
-f.
