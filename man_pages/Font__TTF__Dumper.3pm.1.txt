NAME
       Font::TTF::Dumper - Debug dump of a font datastructure, avoiding
       recursion on ' PARENT'

SYNOPSIS
           use Font::TTF::Dumper;

           # Print a table from the font structure:
           print ttfdump($font->{$tag});

           # Print font table with name
           print ttfdump($font->{'head'}, 'head');

           # Print font table with name and other options
           print ttfdump($font->{'head'}, 'head', %opts);

           # Print one glyph's data:
           print ttfdump($font->{'loca'}->read->{'glyphs'}[$gid], "glyph_$gid");

DESCRIPTION
       Font::TTF data structures are trees created from hashes and arrays.
       When trying to figure out how the structures work, sometimes it is
       helpful to use Data::Dumper on them. However, many of the object
       structures have ' PARENT' links that refer back to the object's parent,
       which means that Data::Dumper ends up dumping the whole font no matter
       what.

       The main purpose of this module is to invoke Data::Dumper with a filter
       that skips over the ' PARENT' element of any hash.

       To reduce output further, this module also skips over ' CACHE' elements
       and any hash element whose value is a Font::TTF::Glyph or
       Font::TTF::Font object.  (Really should make this configurable.)

       If $opts{'d'}, then set Deepcopy mode to minimize use of
       crossreferencing.
