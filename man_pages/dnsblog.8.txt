NAME

dnsblog -
Postfix DNS allow/denylist logger

SYNOPSIS

dnsblog
[generic Postfix daemon options]

DESCRIPTION

The
dnsblog(8) server implements an ad-hoc DNS
allow/denylist lookup service. This may eventually be
replaced by an UDP client that is built directly into the
postscreen(8) server.

PROTOCOL

With each
connection, the dnsblog(8) server receives a DNS
allow/denylist domain name, an IP address, and an ID. If the
IP address is listed under the DNS allow/denylist, the
dnsblog(8) server logs the match and replies with the
query arguments plus an address list with the resulting IP
addresses, separated by whitespace, and the reply TTL.
Otherwise it replies with the query arguments plus an empty
address list and the reply TTL; the reply TTL is -1 if there
is no reply, or a negative reply that contains no SOA
record. Finally, the dnsblog(8) server closes the
connection.

DIAGNOSTICS

Problems and
transactions are logged to syslogd(8) or
postlogd(8).

CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS

Changes to
main.cf are picked up automatically, as
dnsblog(8) processes run for only a limited amount of
time. Use the command "postfix reload" to
speed up a change.
