NAME

packinit -
initialize or update your .package file

SYNOPSIS

packinit

DESCRIPTION

Packinit
will create (or update) a .package file, so that all
the dist tools can be smart and know some basic
things about your package, such as its revision number, or
the e-mail address of its maintainer.

Packinit
should be run from the top level directory of your package,
before using any other dist tool. Later on, you may
rerun it to update some of its values. Packinit will
create a single file and leave the remaining of your
directory undisturbed.
