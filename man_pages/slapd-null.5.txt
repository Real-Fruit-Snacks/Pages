NAME

slapd-null -
Null backend to slapd

SYNOPSIS

/etc/ldap/slapd.conf

DESCRIPTION

The Null
backend to slapd(8) is surely the most useful part of
slapd: 
- Searches return success but no entries. 
- Compares return compareFalse. 
- Updates return success (unless readonly is on) but do
nothing. 
- Binds other than as the rootdn fail unless the database
option "bind on" is given. 
- The slapadd(8) and slapcat(8) tools are
equally exciting. 
Inspired by the /dev/null device.

CONFIGURATION

This
slapd.conf option applies to the NULL backend
database. That is, it must follow a "database
null" line and come before any subsequent
"database" lines. Other database options are
described in the slapd.conf(5) manual page. 
bind 

Allow binds as any DN in this
backend’s suffix, with any password. The default is
"off".

dosearch

If enabled, a single entry will
be returned on all search requests. The entry’s DN
will be the same as the database suffix. The default is
"off".

EXAMPLE

Here is a
possible slapd.conf extract using the Null backend:

database null

suffix "cn=Nothing" 
bind on

ACCESS CONTROL

The null
backend does not honor any of the access control semantics
described in slapd.access(5).
