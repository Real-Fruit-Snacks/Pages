WATCHDOGD(8) BSD System Manager’s Manual
WATCHDOGD(8)

NAME

watchdogd —
watchdog daemon

SYNOPSIS

watchdogd
[−d] [−e cmd]
[−I file]
[−s sleep]
[−t timeout]

DESCRIPTION

The watchdogd utility
interfaces with the kernel’s watchdog facility to
ensure that the system is in a working state. If
watchdogd is unable to interface with the kernel over
a specific timeout, the kernel will take actions to assist
in debugging or restarting the computer.

If
−e cmd is specified, watchdogd
will attempt to execute this command with system(3), and
only if the command returns with a zero exit code will the
watchdog be reset. If −e cmd is not
specified, the daemon will perform a trivial file system
check instead.

The
−s sleep argument can be used to control
the sleep period between each execution of the check and
defaults to one second.

The
−t timeout specifies the desired timeout
period in seconds.

One possible
circumstance which will cause a watchdog timeout is an
interrupt storm. If this occurs, watchdogd will no
longer execute and thus the kernel’s watchdog routines
will take action after a configurable timeout.

Upon receiving
the SIGTERM or SIGINT signals, watchdogd will first
instruct the kernel to no longer perform watchdog checks and
then will terminate.

The
watchdogd utility recognizes the following runtime
options:

−I file

Write the
process ID of the watchdogd utility in the specified
file.

−d

Do not fork.
When this option is specified, watchdogd will not
fork into the background at startup.
