CXGB(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual CXGB(4)

NAME

cxgb — Chelsio T3
10 Gigabit Ethernet adapter driver

SYNOPSIS

To compile this driver into the
kernel, place the following lines in your kernel
configuration file:

device
firmware 
device cxgb

To load the
driver as a module at boot time, place the following line in
loader.conf(5):

if_cxgb_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION

The cxgb driver supports
Transmit/Receive checksum offload, Jumbo Frames, TCP
segmentation offload (TSO), Large Receive Offload (LRO),
VLAN hardware insertion / extraction, and VLAN checksum
offload. For further hardware information, see
http://www.chelsio.com/.

For questions
related to hardware requirements, refer to the documentation
supplied with your Chelsio T3 adapter. All hardware
requirements listed apply to use with FreeBSD.

Support for
Jumbo Frames is provided via the interface MTU setting.
Selecting an MTU larger than 1500 bytes with the ifconfig(8)
utility configures the adapter to receive and transmit Jumbo
Frames. The maximum MTU size for Jumbo Frames is 9000.

For more
information on configuring this device, see ifconfig(8).

HARDWARE

The cxgb driver supports
10 Gigabit and 1 Gigabit Ethernet adapters based on the T3
and T3B chipset:

•

Chelsio 10GBase-CX4

•

Chelsio 10GBase-LR

•

Chelsio 10GBase-SR

LOADER TUNABLES

Tunables can be set at the
loader(8) prompt before booting the kernel or stored in
loader.conf(5).
