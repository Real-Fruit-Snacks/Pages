NAME

pk2bm - create
a bitmap from a TeX pkfont

SYNOPSIS:

pk2bm [-bh]
[-Wwidth] [-Hheight] -cchar pkfont

pk2bm [-bh]
[-Wwidth] [-Hheight] -ooctchar
pkfont

DESCRIPTION

This program
generates a bitmap (ASCII file) which can be used to create
X11 applications. The bitmap file consists of all pixels of
the specified character (via the -c or -o option) from the
given pkfont. The format is described in bitmap(X11).

The pkfont is a
packed fontfile generated by gftopk(TeX) from a gffont. A
gffont is the output of METAFONT a program to design fonts
in a device independent way.

With the -b
flag a bitmap is generated in which all black pixels are
drawn as a &rsquo;*&rsquo; and all white bits as a
&rsquo;.&rsquo;. With the -h flag a hexadecimal bitmap dump
is generated.

The -W and/or
-H options can be used to create a bitmap of respectivally
&rsquo;width&rsquo; and &rsquo;height&rsquo; pixels. The
pk-bitmap will in this case be centered according to these
new dimensions.

The output is
written to the standard output.
