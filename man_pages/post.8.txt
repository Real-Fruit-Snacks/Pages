DESCRIPTION

post
is the default program called by send to deliver the
message in file to local and remote users. In fact,
most of the features attributed to send in its manual
page are performed by post, with send acting
as a relatively simple preprocessor. Thus, it is post
which parses the various header fields, appends a
“Date:” line, and interacts with the mail
transport system. post will not normally be called
directly by the user, but can be replaced by the user with a
postproc profile component that will have file
as its final argument. See mh-profile(5) for more
information on postproc.

post
searches the “To:”, “cc:”,
“Bcc:”, “Fcc:”, and
“Resent-xxx:” header lines of the specified
message for destination addresses, checks these addresses
for validity, and formats them so as to conform to ARPAnet
Internet Message Format protocol, unless the
-noformat flag is set. This will normally cause
“@local-site” to be appended to each
local destination address, as well as any local return
addresses. The -width columns switch can be
used to indicate the preferred length of the header
components that contain addresses.

If a
“Bcc:” field is encountered, its addresses will
be used for delivery, and the “Bcc:” field will
be removed from the message sent to sighted recipients. The
blind recipients will receive an entirely new message with a
minimal set of headers. The body of this new message will
contain a copy of the message sent to the sighted
recipients, either marked up with the indicator text
"Blind-Carbon-Copy" or encapsulated as a MIME
digest.

If
-filter filterfile is specified, then this
copy is filtered (re-formatted) by mhl prior to being
sent to the blind recipients. Alternately, if the
-mime switch is given, then post will use the
MIME rules for encapsulation.

If a
“Dcc:” field is encountered and the
sendmail/pipe mail transport method is not in use,
its addresses will be used for delivery, and the
“Dcc:” field will be removed from the message.
The blind recipients will receive exactly the same message
as the sighted recipients. *WARNING* Recipients listed in
the “Dcc:” field receive no explicit indication
that they have received a “blind copy”. This can
cause blind recipients to inadvertently reply to all of the
sighted recipients of the original message, revealing that
they received a blind copy. On the other hand, since a
normal reply to a message sent via a “Bcc:”
field will generate a reply only to the sender of the
original message, it takes extra effort in most mailers to
reply to the included message, and so would usually only be
done deliberately, rather than by accident.

post
rejects any message that contains a “Dcc:” field
if the sendmail/pipe mail transport method is
used.

The
-alias aliasfile switch can be used to specify
a file that post should read aliases from. More than one
file can be specified, with each being preceded by
-alias. In any event, the primary alias file is read
first.

The
-msgid switch indicates that a
“Message-ID:” or
“Resent-Message-ID:” field should be added to
the header.

The
-messageid switch selects the style used for the part
appearing after the @ in “Message-ID:”,
“Resent-Message-ID:”, and
“Content-ID:” header fields. The two acceptable
options are localname (which is the default), and
random. With localname, the local hostname is
used. With random, a random sequence of characters is
used instead. Note that the -msgid switch must be
enabled for this switch to have any effect.

The
-verbose switch indicates that the user should be
informed of each step of the posting/filing process.

The
-watch switch indicates that the user would like to
watch the transport system’s handling of the message
(e.g., local and “fast” delivery).

Under normal
circumstances, post uses the “From:” line
in the message draft as the identity of the originating
mailbox. A “From:” line is required in all
message drafts. By default the message composition utilities
such as comp, repl and mhmail will
automatically place a “From:” line in the
message draft. There are two ways to override this behavior,
however. Note that they apply equally to
“Resent-From:” lines in messages sent with
dist.

The first way
is to supply a “Sender:” line. The value of this
field will be used as the originating mailbox identity when
submitting the message to the mail transport system. If
multiple addresses are given in the “From:”
line, a “Sender:” line is required. If an
“Envelope-From:” line is supplied when multiple
addresses are given in the “From:” line, a
“Sender:” header will be generated using the
value of the “Envelope-From:” line, if
the “Envelope-From:” line is not blank.

The second way
is to supply a “Envelope-From:” line. The value
of this field will be used as the originating mailbox
identity when submitting the message to the mail transport
system. This will override both the value of the
“From:” line and a “Sender:” line
(if one is supplied). The “Envelope-From:” line
is allowed to have a blank value; if the value is blank,
then the mail transport system will be instructed to not
send any bounces in response to the message. Not all mail
transport systems support this feature.

The mail
transport system default is defined in
/etc/nmh/mts.conf but can be overridden here with the
-mts switch.

If nmh is using
sendmail/pipe or sendmail/smtp as its mail
transport system, the -sendmail switch can be used to
override the default sendmail program.

If nmh is using
the SMTP MTA, the -server and -port switches
can be used to override the default mail server and port.
The default server is set with servers in
/etc/nmh/mts.conf, and the default port is
submission, 587.

If nmh
has been compiled with SASL support, the -sasl and
-nosasl switches will enable and disable the use of
SASL authentication with the SMTP MTA. Depending on the SASL
mechanism used, this may require an additional password
prompt from the user (but the netrc file can be used
to store this password, as described in
mh-profile(5). The -saslmech switch can be
used to select a particular SASL mechanism, and the
-user switch can be used to select an authorization
userid to provide to SASL, other than the default. The
credentials profile entry in mh-profile(5) describes
the ways to supply a username and password.

If SASL
authentication is successful, nmh will attempt to negotiate
a security layer for session encryption. Encrypted data is
labelled with ’(sasl-encrypted)’ and
’(sasl-decrypted)’ when viewing the SMTP
transaction with the -snoop switch. Base64-encoded
data is wrapped with ’b64<>’. (Beware that
the SMTP transaction may contain authentication information
either in plaintext or easily decoded base64.)

If nmh
has been compiled with TLS support, the -tls and
-initialtls switches will require the negotiation of
TLS when connecting to the SMTP MTA. The -tls switch
will negotiate TLS as part of the normal SMTP protocol using
the STARTTLS command. The -initialtls will negotiate
TLS immediately after the connection has taken place, before
any SMTP commands are sent or received. Encrypted data is
labelled with ’(tls-encrypted)’ and
’(tls-decrypted)’ when viewing the SMTP
transaction with the -snoop switch. Base64-encoded
data is wrapped with ’b64<>’. (Beware that
the SMTP transaction may contain authentication information
either in plaintext or easily decoded base64.) The
-notls switch will disable all attempts to negotiate
TLS.

If port 465 is
specified and none of the TLS switches were enabled,
-initialtls will be implied if TLS support was
compiled in. Though port 465 for SMTPS (SMTP over SSL) was
deregistered by IANA in 1998, it is still used for that
service.

post
filters out header lines with names beginning with
“Nmh-” (case insensitive) from the message
draft. Those lines are reserved for internal nmh
use.
