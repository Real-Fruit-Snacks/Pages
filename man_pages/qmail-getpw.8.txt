NAME

qmail-getpw -
give addresses to users

SYNOPSIS

qmail-getpw
local

DESCRIPTION

In
qmail, each user controls a vast array of local
addresses. qmail-getpw finds the user that controls a
particular address, local. It prints six pieces of
information, each terminated by NUL: user;
uid; gid; homedir; dash; and
ext. The user&rsquo;s account name is user;
the user&rsquo;s uid and gid in decimal are uid and
gid; the user&rsquo;s home directory is
homedir; and messages to local will be handled
by homedir/.qmaildashext.

In case of
trouble, qmail-getpw exits nonzero without printing
anything.

WARNING:
The operating system&rsquo;s getpwnam function, which
is at the heart of qmail-getpw, is inherently
unreliable: it fails to distinguish between temporary errors
and nonexistent users. Future versions of getpwnam
should return ETXTBSY to indicate temporary errors and ESRCH
to indicate nonexistent users.

RULES

qmail-getpw
considers an account in /etc/passwd to be a user if
(1) the account has a nonzero uid, (2) the account&rsquo;s
home directory exists (and is visible to
qmail-getpw), and (3) the account owns its home
directory. qmail-getpw ignores account names
containing uppercase letters. qmail-getpw also
assumes that all account names are shorter than 32
characters.

qmail-getpw
gives each user control over the basic user address
and all addresses of the form
user-anything. When local is
user, dash and ext are both empty. When
local is user-anything,
dash is a hyphen and ext is anything.
user may appear in any combination of uppercase and
lowercase letters at the front of local.

A catch-all
user, alias, controls all other addresses. In this
case ext is local and dash is a
hyphen.

You can
override all of qmail-getpw&rsquo;s decisions with
the qmail-users mechanism, which is reliable, highly
configurable, and much faster than qmail-getpw.
