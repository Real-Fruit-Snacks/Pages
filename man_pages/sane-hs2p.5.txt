sane-hs2p(5)             SANE Scanner Access Now Easy             sane-hs2p(5)

NAME
       sane-hs2p - SANE backend for Ricoh SCSI flatbed/ADF scanners

DESCRIPTION
       The sane-hs2p library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) back‐
       end that provides access to the Ricoh IS450 family of scanners.  Should
       also  work  with  the  IS420,  IS410, and IS430 scanners, but these are
       untested.  Please contact the maintainer or the sane-devel mailing list
       if you own such a scanner.

       This  backend  is  alpha-quality.  It  may  have bugs and some scanners
       haven't been tested at all. Be careful and pull the plug if the scanner
       causes unusual noise.

DEVICE NAMES
       This backend expects device names of the form:

              special

       Where  special is the path-name for the special device that corresponds
       to a SCSI scanner. The program sane-find-scanner(1) helps to  find  out
       the  correct  device. Under Linux, such a device name could be /dev/sg0
       or /dev/sga, for example.  See sane-scsi(5) for details.

CONFIGURATION
       The contents of the hs2p.conf file is a list of device names that  cor‐
       respond  to  SCSI scanners.  Empty lines and lines starting with a hash
       mark (#) are ignored.  See sane-scsi(5) on details of what  constitutes
       a valid device name.

FILES
       /etc/sane.d/hs2p.conf
              The   backend   configuration  file  (see  also  description  of
              SANE_CONFIG_DIR below).

       /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-hs2p.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-hs2p.so
              The shared library implementing this backend (present on systems
              that support dynamic loading).

ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_CONFIG_DIR
              This environment variable specifies the list of directories that
              may contain the configuration file.  On *NIX systems, the direc‐
              tories are separated by a colon (`:'), under OS/2, they are sep‐
              arated by a semi-colon (`;').  If this variable is not set,  the
              configuration  file  is  searched  in  two  default directories:
              first,  the  current  working  directory  (".")  and   then   in
              /etc/sane.d.  If the value of the environment variable ends with
              the directory separator character, then the default  directories
              are  searched  after  the explicitly specified directories.  For
              example, setting SANE_CONFIG_DIR to "/tmp/config:" would  result
              in directories tmp/config, ., and /etc/sane.d being searched (in
              this order).

       SANE_DEBUG_HS2P
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this en‐
              vironment variable controls the debug level for this backend.  A
              value of 255 prints all debug  output.   Smaller  values  reduce
              verbosity.

CURRENT STATUS
       The  sane-hs2p  backend  is now in version 1.00. All major scanning-re‐
       lated features are supported, except for those features  requiring  the
       optional  IPU.  Scanning from the flatbed or ADF (either simplex or du‐
       plex) is supported. Lineart, halftone, 4-bit gray, and 8-bit  gray  are
       supported. Pre-set gamma tables and halftone patterns are supported, as
       well as brightness, threshold, contrast.  Also supported is  scan  wait
       mode,  binary  and  gray  filtering, negative scanning, and absolute or
       relative white setting. Printing with the  optional  endorser  also  is
       supported.

PLANNED FUNCTIONALITY
       This  scanner  can  scan from the ADF in continuous simplex mode.  Sur‐
       prisingly, many scanners scan an entire document from the ADF into mem‐
       ory  before  ejecting  the sheet. Thus if the document is too long, the
       scanner cannot hold the entire image data in memory.  But if the  scan‐
       ner  would  send its image data when its memory got full, and then read
       the next buffer's worth of data, continuous scanning could be achieved.

MISSING FUNCTIONALITY
       The SCSI commands for uploading (2AH) or downloading (28H) custom half‐
       tone  patterns  (02H)  and gamma vectors (03H) should work, but require
       implementing the SANE Option-Value code to allow the user to create the
       tables  to  be uploaded to the scanner. No support for Maintenance Data
       (80H) is planned as this functionality is more suited to a  stand-alone
       utility to be used by a technician when replacing the lamp or ADF unit.
       Nor is support for reading or changing IPU (93H) parameters and adjust‐
       ments  planned,  since  my  IS450  lacks  such a unit. The 31-byte Auto
       Photo/Letter struct and 21-byte Dynamic threshold struct are documented
       in  the hs2p-scsi.h file should someone wish to use their IPU for image
       data processing.
