NAME
       systemd-networkd.service, systemd-networkd - Network manager

SYNOPSIS
       systemd-networkd.service

       /lib/systemd/systemd-networkd

DESCRIPTION
       systemd-networkd is a system service that manages networks. It detects
       and configures network devices as they appear, as well as creating
       virtual network devices.

       Certain low-level settings of physical network devices (e.g. device
       names and altnames) as well as the creation of SR-IOV virtual functions
       on physical network interfaces may be managed by systemd-udevd(8)
       according to the contents of systemd.link(5) files.

       systemd-networkd will create "virtual" network devices (e.g. bridges
       and tunnels) based on the configuration in systemd.netdev(5) files,
       respecting the [Match] sections in those files.

       systemd-networkd will manage network addresses and routes for any link
       for which it finds a .network file with an appropriate [Match] section,
       see systemd.network(5). For those links, it will flush existing network
       addresses and routes when bringing up the device (except when directed
       not to). Any links not matched by one of the .network files will be
       ignored. It is also possible to explicitly tell systemd-networkd to
       ignore a link by using the Unmanaged=yes option, see
       systemd.network(5).

       When systemd-networkd exits, it generally leaves existing network
       devices and configuration intact. This makes it possible to transition
       from the initrd and to restart the service without breaking
       connectivity. This also means that when configuration is updated and
       systemd-networkd is restarted, netdev interfaces for which
       configuration was removed will not be dropped, and may need to be
       cleaned up manually.

       systemd-networkd may be introspected and controlled at runtime using
       networkctl(1).

CONFIGURATION FILES
       The configuration files are read from the files located in the system
       network directory /lib/systemd/network, the volatile runtime network
       directory /run/systemd/network and the local administration network
       directory /etc/systemd/network.

       Networks are configured in .network files, see systemd.network(5), and
       virtual network devices are configured in .netdev files, see
       systemd.netdev(5).
