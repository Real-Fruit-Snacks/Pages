NAME
       Dpkg::Deps::KnownFacts - list of installed real and virtual packages

DESCRIPTION
       This class represents a list of installed packages and a list of
       virtual packages provided (by the set of installed packages).

METHODS
       $facts = Dpkg::Deps::KnownFacts->new();
           Creates a new object.

       $facts->add_installed_package($package, $version, $arch, $multiarch)
           Records that the given version of the package is installed. If
           $version/$arch is undefined we know that the package is installed
           but we don't know which version/architecture it is. $multiarch is
           the Multi-Arch field of the package. If $multiarch is undef, it
           will be equivalent to "Multi-Arch: no".

           Note that $multiarch is only used if $arch is provided.

       $facts->add_provided_package($virtual, $relation, $version, $by)
           Records that the "$by" package provides the $virtual package.
           $relation and $version correspond to the associated relation given
           in the Provides field (if present).

       $facts->evaluate_simple_dep()
           This method is private and should not be used except from within
           Dpkg::Deps.

       it should not have been part of the public API.
