TAN(3POSIX)                POSIX Programmer's Manual               TAN(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       tan, tanf, tanl — tangent function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <math.h>

       double tan(double x);
       float tanf(float x);
       long double tanl(long double x);

DESCRIPTION
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with  the
       ISO C  standard.  Any  conflict between the requirements described here
       and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017
       defers to the ISO C standard.

       These functions shall compute the tangent of their argument x, measured
       in radians.

       An application wishing to check for error situations should  set  errno
       to  zero  and  call  feclearexcept(FE_ALL_EXCEPT)  before calling these
       functions. On return, if errno is non-zero or fetestexcept(FE_INVALID |
       FE_DIVBYZERO  |  FE_OVERFLOW  | FE_UNDERFLOW) is non-zero, an error has
       occurred.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, these functions shall return the tangent of
       x.

       If the correct value would cause underflow, and is not representable, a
       range error may occur, and tan(), tanf(), and tanl() shall return  0.0,
       or (if IEC 60559 Floating-Point is not supported) an implementation-de‐
       fined  value  no  greater  in  magnitude  than  DBL_MIN,  FLT_MIN,  and
       LDBL_MIN, respectively.

       If x is NaN, a NaN shall be returned.

       If x is ±0, x shall be returned.

       If x is subnormal, a range error may occur
       and x should be returned.

       If  x is not returned, tan(), tanf(), and tanl() shall return an imple‐
       mentation-defined value no greater in magnitude than DBL_MIN,  FLT_MIN,
       and LDBL_MIN, respectively.

       If  x  is  ±Inf,  a domain error shall occur, and either a NaN (if sup‐
       ported), or an implementation-defined value shall be returned.

       If the correct value would cause underflow,  and  is  representable,  a
       range error may occur and the correct value shall be returned.

       If  the  correct  value would cause overflow, a range error shall occur
       and tan(), tanf(), and tanl() shall return ±HUGE_VAL,  ±HUGE_VALF,  and
       ±HUGE_VALL,  respectively,  with  the same sign as the correct value of
       the function.

ERRORS
       These functions shall fail if:

       Domain Error
                   The value of x is ±Inf.

                   If the integer expression (math_errhandling  &  MATH_ERRNO)
                   is non-zero, then errno shall be set to [EDOM].  If the in‐
                   teger expression  (math_errhandling  &  MATH_ERREXCEPT)  is
                   non-zero,  then  the invalid floating-point exception shall
                   be raised.

       Range Error The result overflows

                   If the integer expression (math_errhandling  &  MATH_ERRNO)
                   is  non-zero,  then errno shall be set to [ERANGE].  If the
                   integer expression (math_errhandling &  MATH_ERREXCEPT)  is
                   non-zero,  then the overflow floating-point exception shall
                   be raised.

       These functions may fail if:

       Range Error The result underflows, or the value of x is subnormal.

                   If the integer expression (math_errhandling  &  MATH_ERRNO)
                   is  non-zero,  then errno shall be set to [ERANGE].  If the
                   integer expression (math_errhandling &  MATH_ERREXCEPT)  is
                   non-zero, then the underflow floating-point exception shall
                   be raised.

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
   Taking the Tangent of a 45-Degree Angle
           #include <math.h>
           ...
           double radians = 45.0 * M_PI / 180;
           double result;
           ...
           result = tan (radians);

APPLICATION USAGE
       There are no known floating-point representations such that for a  nor‐
       mal argument, tan(x) is either overflow or underflow.

       These  functions may lose accuracy when their argument is near a multi‐
       ple of π/2 or is far from 0.0.

       On error, the expressions (math_errhandling & MATH_ERRNO) and (math_er‐
       rhandling & MATH_ERREXCEPT) are independent of each other, but at least
       one of them must be non-zero.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
