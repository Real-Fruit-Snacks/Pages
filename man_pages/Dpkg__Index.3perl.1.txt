NAME
       Dpkg::Index - generic index of control information

DESCRIPTION
       This class represent a set of Dpkg::Control objects.

METHODS
       $index = Dpkg::Index->new(%opts)
           Creates a new empty index. See set_options() for more details.

       $index->set_options(%opts)
           The "type" option is checked first to define default values for
           other options. Here are the relevant options: "get_key_func" is a
           function returning a key for the item passed in parameters,
           "unique_tuple_key" is a boolean requesting whether the default key
           should be the unique tuple (default to true), "item_opts" is a hash
           reference that will be passed to the item constructor in the
           new_item() method.  The index can only contain one item with a
           given key.  The "get_key_func" function used depends on the type:

           •   for CTRL_INFO_SRC, it is the Source field;

           •   for CTRL_INDEX_SRC and CTRL_PKG_SRC it is the Package and
               Version fields (concatenated with "_") when "unique_tuple_key"
               is true (the default), or otherwise the Package field;

           •   for CTRL_INFO_PKG it is simply the Package field;

           •   for CTRL_INDEX_PKG and CTRL_PKG_DEB it is the Package, Version
               and Architecture fields (concatenated with "_") when
               "unique_tuple_key" is true (the default) or otherwise the
               Package field;

           •   for CTRL_CHANGELOG it is the Source and the Version fields
               (concatenated with an intermediary "_");

           •   for CTRL_TESTS is an integer index (0-based) corresponding to
               the Tests or Test-Command field stanza;

           •   for CTRL_FILE_CHANGES it is the Source, Version and
               Architecture fields (concatenated with "_");

           •   for CTRL_FILE_VENDOR it is the Vendor field;

           •   for CTRL_FILE_STATUS it is the Package and Architecture fields
               (concatenated with "_");

           •   otherwise it is the Package field by default.

       $index->get_type()
           Returns the type of control information stored. See the type
           parameter set during new().

       $index->add($item, [$key])
           Add a new item in the index. If the $key parameter is omitted, the
           key will be generated with the get_key_func function (see
           set_options() for details).

       $index->parse($fh, $desc)
           Reads the filehandle and creates all items parsed. When called
           multiple times, the parsed stanzas are accumulated.

           Returns the number of items parsed.

       $index->load($file)
           Reads the file and creates all items parsed. Returns the number of
           items parsed. Handles compressed files transparently based on their
           extensions.

       $item = $index->new_item()
           Creates a new item. Mainly useful for derived objects that would
           want to override this method to return something else than a
           Dpkg::Control object.

       $item = $index->get_by_key($key)
           Returns the item identified by $key or undef.

       @keys = $index->get_keys(%criteria)
           Returns the keys of items that matches all the criteria. The key of
           the %criteria hash is a field name and the value is either a regex
           that needs to match the field value, or a reference to a function
           that must return true and that receives the field value as single
           parameter, or a scalar that must be equal to the field value.

       @items = $index->get(%criteria)
           Returns all the items that matches all the criteria.

       $index->remove_by_key($key)
           Remove the item identified by the given key.

       @items = $index->remove(%criteria)
           Returns and removes all the items that matches all the criteria.

       $index->merge($other_index, %opts)
           Merge the entries of the other index. While merging, the keys of
           the merged index are used, they are not re-computed (unless you
           have set the options "keep_keys" to "0"). It's your responsibility
           to ensure that they have been computed with the same function.

       $index->sort(\&sortfunc)
           Sort the index with the given sort function. If no function is
           given, an alphabetic sort is done based on the keys. The sort
           function receives the items themselves as parameters and not the
           keys.

       $str = $index->output([$fh])
       "$index"
           Get a string representation of the index. The Dpkg::Control objects
           are output in the order which they have been read or added except
           if the order have been changed with sort().

           Print the string representation of the index to a filehandle if $fh
           has been passed.

       $index->save($file)
           Writes the content of the index in a file. Auto-compresses files
           based on their extensions.

CHANGES
   Version 3.00 (dpkg 1.21.2)
       Change behavior: The CTRL_TESTS key now defaults to a stanza index.

   Version 2.01 (dpkg 1.20.6)
       New option: Add new "item_opts" option.

   Version 2.00 (dpkg 1.20.0)
       Change behavior: The "unique_tuple_key" option now defaults to true.

   Version 1.01 (dpkg 1.19.0)
       New option: Add new "unique_tuple_key" option to $index->set_options()
       to set better default "get_key_func" options, which will become the
       default behavior in 1.20.x.

   Version 1.00 (dpkg 1.15.6)
