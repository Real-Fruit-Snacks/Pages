NAME

conserver.cf -
console configuration file for conserver(8)

DESCRIPTION

The format of
the conserver.cf file is made up of named blocks of
keyword/value pairs, comments, and optional whitespace for
formatting flexibility. The block types as well as the
keywords are pre-defined and explained in the
BLOCKS section. A comment is an
unquoted pound-sign to a newline. See the
PARSER section for full details on
whitespace and quoting.

Let me first
show you a sample block with a couple of keyword/value pairs
to make the description a bit simpler to understand.

console simple
{ master localhost; type exec; rw *; }

This is
actually a fully functional conserver.cf file (if certain
conditions are met...and if you can list those conditions,
you can probably can skip to the
BLOCKS section).

Our example is
made of up of a console-block named
’’simple’’ with three keyword/value
pairs. What this does is define a console named
’’simple’’, makes the master of that
console the host ’’localhost’’,
makes the type an exec-style console, and gives every user
read/write permission. This is the generic format of the
file:

block-type
block-name { keyword value; ... }

To show the
addition of comments and whitespace, here is the example
reformatted (but functionally equivalent):

# define a
console named "simple" 
console simple { 
# setting all required values... 
master localhost; 
type exec; # exec-style console 
rw *; # allow any username 
}

PARSER

The parser has
six characters that it considers special. These are:
’’{’’,
’’}’’,
’’;’’,
’’#’’,
’’\’’, and
’’"’’. The first three (hereby
called tokens) define the format of the configuration blocks
and are used as word separators, the next is the comment
character, and the last two are quoting characters.

Word separation
occurs when the parser encounters an unquoted token and, in
certain cases, whitespace. Whitespace is only used as a word
separator when the parser is looking for a block-type or
keyword. When it’s looking for a block-name or value,
whitespace is like any other character, which allows you to
embed whitespace in a block-name or value without having to
quote it. Here is an example:

default my defs
{ rw *; include other defs ; }

The block-type
is ’’default’’, the block-name is
’’my defs’’, and the value for the
keyword ’’include’’ is
’’other defs’’. Whitespace around
tokens are ignored so you get ’’other
defs’’ instead of ’’other defs
’’ as the value.

The only way to
use one of the special characters as part of a block-name or
value is to quote it.

Quoting is a
simple matter of prefixing a character with a backslash or
surrounding a group of characters with double-quotes. If a
character is prefixed by a backslash, the next character is
a literal (so ’’\\’’ produces a
’’\’’,
’’\"’’ produces
’’"’’,
’’\{’’ produces a
’’{’’, etc.). For double-quoted
strings, all characters are literal except for
’’\"’’, which embeds a
double-quote.

Adding a
variety of quotes to our example without changing the
meaning of things, we have:

"defa"ult
my\ defs { rw *; in\clude "other defs" ; }

There is one
special line the parser recognizes: a
’’#include’’ statement. It is of the
form:

#include
filename

Any whitespace
around filename is ignored, but whitespace embedded
inside is preserved. Everything in filename is taken
literally, so none of the normal parser quoting applies. The
#include must begin in ’’column
0’’ - no whitespace is allowed between it and
the start of the physical line. There is an include file
depth limit of 10 to prevent infinite recursion.

BLOCKS

access
hostname|ipaddr

Define an access block for the
host named hostname or using the address
ipaddr. If the value of ’’*’’
is used, the access block will be applied to all conserver
hosts. Access lists are used in a first match fashion (top
down), so order is important. 
admin
[!]username[,...]|""

Define a list of users making
up the admin list for the console server. If username
matches a previously defined group name, all members of the
previous group are applied to the admin list (with access
reversed if prefixed with a ’!’). If
username doesn’t match a previously defined
group and username begins with ’@’, the
name (minus the ’@’) is checked against the
host’s group database. All users found in the group
will be granted (or denied, if prefixed with
’!’) access. If username doesn’t
match a previous group and doesn’t begin with
’@’, the users will be granted (or denied, if
prefixed with ’!’) access. If the null string
(’’""’’) is used,
any users previously defined for the console servers’s
admin list are removed.

allowed
hostname[,...]

The list of hostnames are added
to the ’’allowed’’ list, which
grants connections from the hosts but requires username
authentication.

include
accessgroup

The access lists defined using
the name accessgroup are applied to the current
access block. The included access block must be previously
defined.

limited
[!]username[,...]|""

Define a list of users with
limited functionality on the console server. These users
will not be allowed to suspend their connection, shift to
another console, or attach to a local command. If
username matches a previously defined group name, all
members of the previous group are applied to the admin list
(with access reversed if prefixed with a ’!’).
If username doesn’t match a previously defined
group and username begins with ’@’, the
name (minus the ’@’) is checked against the
host’s group database. All users found in the group
will be granted (or denied, if prefixed with
’!’) access. If username doesn’t
match a previous group and doesn’t begin with
’@’, the users will be granted (or denied, if
prefixed with ’!’) access. If the null string
(’’""’’) is used,
any users previously defined for the console server’s
limited list are removed.

rejected
hostname[,...]

The list of hostnames are added
to the ’’rejected’’ list, which
rejects connections from the hosts.

trusted
hostname[,...]

The list of hostnames are added
to the ’’trusted’’ list, which
grants connections from the hosts without username
authentication.

break n

Define a break sequence where
(1 n n n’’ client escape
sequence. 
confirm
yes|true|on|no|false|off

Set whether or not to ask the
client for confirmation before sending the break sequence.
The default is ’’no’’.

delay n

Set the time delay for the
\d sequence to n milliseconds. The default
time delay is 250ms.

string
breakseq

Assign the string
breakseq to the specified slot n. A break
sequence is a simple character string with the exception of
’\’ and ’^’:

\a

alert

\b

backspace

\d

delay specified by the delay option.

\f

form-feed

\n

newline

\r

carriage-return

\t

tab

\v

vertical-tab

\z

serial break

\\

backslash

\^

circumflex

\ooo

octal representation of a character (where ooo is
one to three octal digits)

\c

character c

^?

delete

^c

control character (c is
’’and’’ed with 0x1f)

config
hostname|ipaddr

Define a configuration block
for the host named hostname or using the address
ipaddr. If the value of ’’*’’
is used, the configuration block will be applied to all
conserver hosts. 
autocomplete
yes|true|on|no|false|off

Turn the console name
autocompletion feature on or off. If autocompletion is on, a
client can use any unique leading portion of a console name
when connecting to a console. Autocompletion is on by
default.

defaultaccess
rejected|trusted|allowed

Set the default access
permission for all hosts not matched by an access list (see
the -a command-line flag).

daemonmode
yes|true|on|no|false|off

Set whether or not to become a
daemon when run (see the -d command-line flag).

initdelay
number

Set the number of seconds
between console initializations. All consoles with the same
host value will be throttled as a group (those
without a host value are their own group). In other
words, each console within a group will only be initialized
after number seconds passes from the previous
initialization of a console in that group. Different
throttle groups are initialized simultaneously. One warning:
since consoles are split up and managed by seperate
conserver processes, it’s possible for more than one
conserver process to have a throttle group based on a
particular host value. If this happens, each
conserver process will throttle their groups independently
of the other conserver processes, which results in a more
rapid initialization (per host value) than one might
otherwise expect. If number is zero, all consoles are
initialized without delay.

logfile
filename

Set the logfile to write to
when in daemon mode (see the -L command-line
flag).

passwdfile
filename

Set the password file location
used for authentication (see the -P command-line
flag).

primaryport
number|name

Set the port used by the master
conserver process (see the -p command-line flag).

redirect
yes|true|on|no|false|off

Turn redirection on or off (see
the -R command-line flag).

reinitcheck
number

Set the number of minutes used
between reinitialization checks (see the -O
command-line flag).

secondaryport
number|name

Set the base port number used
by child processes (see the -b command-line
flag).

setproctitle
yes|true|on|no|false|off

Set whether or not the process
title shows master/group functionality as well as the port
number the process is listening on and how many consoles it
is managing. The operating system must support the
setproctitle() call.

sslcredentials
filename

Set the SSL
credentials file location (see the -c command-line
flag).

sslcacertificatefile
filename

Load the valid CA certificates
for the SSL connection from the PEM encoded
file. This option overrides the global CA list.

sslreqclientcert
yes|true|on|no|false|off

Set whether or not a
certificate is required by the client to connect. The
default is ’’no’’.

sslrequired
yes|true|on|no|false|off

Set whether or not encryption
is required when talking to clients (see the -E
command-line flag).

unifiedlog
filename

Set the location of the unified
log to filename. See the -U command-line flag
for details.

console name

Define a console identified as
name. The keywords are the same as the default
block with the following addition. 
aliases name[,...]|""

Define a list of console
aliases. If the null string
(’’""’’) is used,
any aliases previously defined for the console are
removed.

default name

Define a block of defaults
identified as name. If name is
’’*’’, the automatically applied
default block is defined (basically all consoles have an
implicit ’’include "*";’’
at the beginning of their definition). 
baud 

300|600|1800|2400|4800|9600|19200|38400|57600|115200|..|4000000

Assign the baud rate to the
console. Only consoles of type
’’device’’ will use this value.

break n

Assign the break sequence
n as the default for the console, which is used by
the ’’^Ecl0’’ client escape
sequence.

breaklist
n[,...]|""

Associate a list of break
sequences referenced by n with the console. If
’’*’’ is used (the default), all
defined break sequences will be available. If the null
string (’’""’’) is
used, no sequences will be available.

device
filename

Assign the serial device
filename as the path to the console. Only consoles of
type ’’device’’ will use this
value.

devicesubst
c=t[n]f[,...]|""

Perform character substitutions
on the device value. A series of replacements can be
defined by specifying a comma-separated list of
c=t[n]f sequences where c
is any printable character, t specifies the
replacement value, n is a field length (optional),
and f is the format string. t can be one of
the characters below, catagorized as a string replacement or
a numeric replacement, which dictates the use of the
n and f fields.

String Replacement

c

console name

h

host value

r

replstring value

Numeric
Replacement

b

baud value

p

config port value

P

calculated port value

For string
replacements, if the replacement isn’t at least
n characters, it will be padded with space characters
on the left. f must be ’s’. For numeric
replacements, the value will be formatted to at least
n characters, padded with 0s if n begins with
a 0, and space characters otherwise. f must be either
’d’, ’x’, ’X’,
’a’, or ’A’, specifying a decimal,
lowercase hexadecimal (0-9a-f), uppercase hexadecimal
(0-9A-F), lowercase alphanumeric (0-9a-z), or uppercase
alphanumeric (0-9A-Z) conversion. If the null string
(’’""’’) is used,
no replacements will be done.

exec
command|""

Assign the string
command as the command to access the console.
Conserver will run the command by invoking
’’/bin/sh -ce
"command"’’. If the null string
(’’""’’) is used or
no exec keyword is specified, conserver will use the
command ’’/bin/sh -i’’. Only
consoles of type ’’exec’’ will use
this value.

execrunas
[user][:group]|""

By default, the command invoked
by exec is run with the same privileges as the
server. If the server is running with root privileges, this
option resets the user and/or group of the invoked process
to user and group respectively. user
may be a username or numeric uid and group may be a
group name or numeric gid. Either one is optional. If the
server is not running with root privileges, these values are
not used. If the null string
(’’""’’) is
specified, the default of running with the same privileges
as the server is restored.

execsubst
c=t[n]f[,...]|""

Perform character substitutions
on the exec value. See the devicesubst option
for an explanation of the format string. If the null string
(’’""’’) is used,
no replacements will be done.

host hostname

Assign hostname as the
host to connect to for accessing the console. You must also
set the port option for consoles of type
’’host’’. Normally, only consoles of
type ’’host’’ and
’’ipmi’’ will use this value,
however if the devicesubst, execsubst, or
initsubst keywords are used in any console type, this
value is used.

idlestring
string|""

Assign the string that
is sent to the console once the console is idle for an
idletimeout amount of time. If the null string
(’’""’’) is used,
the string is unset and the default is used. The string is
interpreted just as a break string is interpreted
(see the break configuration items for details) where
all delays specified (via ’’\d’’)
use the default delay time. The default string is
’’\n’’.

idletimeout
number[s|m|h]

Set the idle timeout of the
console to number seconds. If an ’s’,
’m’, or ’h’ is used after
number, the specified time is interpreted as seconds,
minutes, or hours. Set the timeout to zero to disable the
idle timeout (the default).

ipmiciphersuite
number

Set the IPMI cipher suite.
Syntactically valid values are -1 (the default) and greater.
Check the FreeIPMI documentation for usable values.

ipmikg
string|""

Set the BMC authentication key
K_g to string. A K_g value is a simple character
string with the exception of ’\’:

\\

backslash

\ooo

octal representation of a character (where ooo is
one to three octal digits)

\c

character c

The resulting
value must be no more than 20 characters. The null string
(’’""’’) is the
default.

ipmiworkaround
[!]option[,...]|""

You can turn off a workaround
by prefixing it with a ’’!’’
character. So, to turn off the integrity workaround,
you would use !integrity. The following are valid
options and their mapping to FreeIPMI settings:

activation-status

SKIP_SOL_ACTIVATION_STATUS

auth-capabilites

AUTHENTICATION_CAPABILITIES

channel-payload

SKIP_CHANNEL_PAYLOAD_SUPPORT

checksum

NO_CHECKSUM_CHECK

default

DEFAULT

ignore-payload-size

IGNORE_SOL_PAYLOAD_SIZE

ignore-port

IGNORE_SOL_PORT

integrity

NON_EMPTY_INTEGRITY_CHECK_VALUE

intel-session

INTEL_2_0_SESSION

packet-sequence

INCREMENT_SOL_PACKET_SEQUENCE

privilege

OPEN_SESSION_PRIVILEGE

serial-alerts

SERIAL_ALERTS_DEFERRED

sun-session

SUN_2_0_SESSION

supermicro-session

SUPERMICRO_2_0_SESSION

If no
ipmiworkaround is specified, the
’’default’’ workaround will
be used. The null string
(’’""’’) unsets all
workarounds, including
’’default’’. See the FreeIPMI
documentation for details on what workarounds affect.

ipmiprivlevel
user|operator|admin

Set the privilege level for the
username used during IPMI authentication. The default
privilege level is
’’admin’’.

include
default

The default block defined using
the name default is applied to the current console or
default block. The included default block must be previously
defined.

initcmd
command|""

Invoke command as soon
as the console is brought up, redirecting the console to
stdin, stdout, and stderr of command. The
command is passed as an argument to
’’/bin/sh -ce’’. If the null string
(’’""’’) is used,
the command is unset and nothing is invoked.

initrunas
[user][:group]|""

By default, the command invoked
by initcmd is run with the same privileges as the
server. If the server is running with root privileges, this
option resets the user and/or group of the invoked process
to user and group respectively. user
may be a username or numeric uid and group may be a
group name or numeric gid. Either one is optional. If the
server is not running with root privileges, these values are
not used. If the null string
(’’""’’) is
specified, the default of running with the same privileges
as the server is restored.

initspinmax
n|""

Set the maximum number of
’’spins’’ allowed for the console to
n, where 0 n initspintimer seconds from its previous
initialization and this quick initialization occurs
initspinmax times in a row. If, at any point, the
time between initializations is greater than
initspintimer, the counter for reaching
initspinmax resets to zero. When a console is
determined to be ’’spinning’’ it is
forced down. If the null string
(’’""’’) is
specified, the default of 5 is used.

initspintimer
t|""

Set the number of seconds a
console must be ’’up’’ to not be
considered ’’spinning’’ to t,
where 0 t initspinmax for
a full description of console
’’spinning.’’ If the null string
(’’""’’) is
specified, the default of 1 is used.

initsubst
c=t[n]f[,...]|""

Perform character substitutions
on the initcmd value. See the devicesubst
option for an explanation of the format string. If the null
string (’’""’’) is
used, no replacements will be done.

logfile
filename|""

Assign the logfile specified by
filename to the console. Any occurrence of
’’&’’ in filename will be
replaced with the name of the console. If the null string
(’’""’’) is used,
the logfile name is unset and no logging will occur.

logfilemax
number[k|m]

Enable automatic rotation of
logfile once its size exceeds number bytes.
Specifying k or m interpret number as
kilobytes and megabytes. number must be at least 2048
bytes. A value of zero will turn off automatic rotation of
logfile. The logfile filename will be
renamed filename- YYYYMMDD -
HHMMSS , where the extension is the current
GMT year, month, day, hour, minute, and second (to prevent
issues with clock rollbacks). File sizes are checked every 5
minutes with an additional initial pseudo-random delay of up
to one minute (to help prevent all processes checking all
consoles simultaneously). 2.5% (minimum 100 bytes, maximum
4000 bytes) of the old logfile is read from the end of the
file. All data past the first newline is moved (not copied)
to the new logfile so that a replay of the console works and
starts on a line boundary.

master
hostname|ipaddr

Define which conserver host
manages the console. The host may be specified by
hostname or using the address ipaddr.

motd
message|""

Set the "message of the
day" for the console to message, which gets
displayed when a client attaches to the console. If the null
string (’’""’’) is
used, the MOTD is unset and no message will occur.

options
[!]option[,...]|""

You can negate the option by
prefixing it with a ’’!’’
character. So, to turn off the hupcl flag, you would
use !hupcl. The following are valid
options:

ixon

Enable XON/XOFF flow control on output.
Only consoles of type ’’device’’ or
’’exec’’ will use this value.
Default is ixon.

ixany

Enable any character to restart output. Only consoles of
type ’’device’’ or
’’exec’’ will use this value.
Default is !ixany.

ixoff

Enable XON/XOFF flow control on input.
Only consoles of type ’’device’’ or
’’exec’’ will use this value.
Default is ixoff for consoles of type
’’device’’ and !ixoff for
consoles of type ’’exec’’.

crtscts

Enable RTS/CTS (hardware) flow control.
Only consoles of type ’’device’’
will use this value. Default is !crtscts.

cstopb

Set two stop bits, rather than one. Only consoles of
type ’’device’’ will use this value.
Default is !cstopb.

hupcl

Lower modem control lines after last process closes the
device (hang up). Only consoles of type
’’device’’ will use this value.
Default is !hupcl.

ondemand

Initialize the console when a client requests a
connection to the console. When no clients are connected,
bring the console down. The conserver option -i will
set this flag for all consoles. Default is
!ondemand. 

striphigh

Strip the high bit off all data coming from this console
and all clients connected to this console before processing
occurs. The conserver option -7 will set this flag
for all consoles. Default is !striphigh.

reinitoncc

Automatically reinitialize (’’bring
up’’) a downed console when a client connects.
Without this option, a client will be attached to the downed
console and will need to manually reinitialize the console
with an escape sequence. The conserver option -o will
set this flag for all consoles. Default is
!reinitoncc. 

autoreinit

Allow this console to be automatically reinitialized if
it unexpectedly goes down. If the console doesn’t come
back up, it is retried every minute. A console of type
’’exec’’ that exits with a zero exit
status is automatically reinitialized regardless of this
setting. The conserver option -F will unset
this flag for all consoles. Default is
autoreinit. 

unloved

Enable the sending of this console’s output
(prefixed with its name) to the daemon’s stdout (or
the logfile if in daemon mode) when no clients are connected
to the console. The conserver option -u will set this
flag for all consoles. Default is !unloved.

login

Allow users to log into this console. If logins are not
allowed, conserver will send a generic message to the client
saying so and terminate the connection. You can override the
generic message by setting the motd message. Default
is login.

parity
even|mark|none|odd|space

Set the parity option for the
console. Only consoles of type
’’device’’ will use this value.

password
password|""

Use password during IPMI
authentication. If the null string
(’’""’’) is used
(the default), no password will be used.

port
number|name

Set the port used to access the
console. The port may be specified as a number or a
name. A name will cause a
getservbyname(3) call to look up the port number. The
port, portbase, and portinc values are
all used to calculate the final port number to connect to.
The formula used is finalport = portbase +
portinc * port. By using proper values in the
formula, you can reference ports on a terminal server by
their physical numbering of 0..n or 1..n
(depending on if you like zero-based or one-based
numbering). Warning: you can generate a -1 value with this
formula, which will become a very high numbered positive
value (since things are stored unsigned). You must also set
the host option as well. Normally, only consoles of
type ’’host’’ will use this value,
however if the devicesubst, execsubst, or
initsubst keywords are used in any console type, this
value is used.

portbase
number

Set the base value for the port
calculation formula. number must be 0 or greater. The
default is zero. See port for the details of the
formula.

portinc
number

Set the increment value for the
port calculation formula. number must be 0 or
greater. The default is one. See port for the details
of the formula.

protocol
telnet|raw

Set the protocol used to send
and receive data from the console. If raw is used,
all data is sent ’’as is’’,
unprotected by any protocol specification. If telnet
is used (which is the default), data is encapsulated in the
telnet protocol. The striphigh console option still
applies when data is read by the server, and if enabled, can
impact the encapsulation process.

replstring
string

A generic replacement string
that can be used by the devicesubst,
execsubst, and initsubst keywords.

ro
[!]username[,...]|""

Define a list of users making
up the read-only access list for the console. If
username matches a previously defined group name, all
members of the previous group are applied to the read-only
access list (with access reversed if prefixed with a
’!’). If username doesn’t match a
previously defined group and username begins with
’@’, the name (minus the ’@’) is
checked against the host’s group database. All users
found in the group will be granted (or denied, if prefixed
with ’!’) read-only access. If username
doesn’t match a previous group and doesn’t begin
with ’@’, the users will be granted (or denied,
if prefixed with ’!’) read-only access. If the
null string
(’’""’’) is used,
any users previously defined for the console’s
read-only list are removed.

rw
[!]username[,...]|""

Define a list of users making
up the read-write access list for the console. If
username matches a previously defined group name, all
members of the previous group are applied to the read-write
access list (with access reversed if prefixed with a
’!’). If username doesn’t match a
previously defined group and username begins with
’@’, the name (minus the ’@’) is
checked against the host’s group database. All users
found in the group will be granted (or denied, if prefixed
with ’!’) read-write access. If username
doesn’t match a previous group and doesn’t begin
with ’@’, the users will be granted (or denied,
if prefixed with ’!’) read-write access. If the
null string
(’’""’’) is used,
any users previously defined for the console’s
read-write list are removed.

tasklist
c[,...]|""

Associate a list of tasks
referenced by c with the console. If
’’*’’ is used (the default), all
defined tasks will be available. If the null string
(’’""’’) is used,
no tasks will be available.

timestamp
[number[m|h|d|l]][a][b]|""

Specifies the time between
timestamps applied to the console log file and whether to
log read/write connection actions. The timestamps look like
’’[-- MARK -- Mon Jan 25 14:46:56
1999]’’. The ’m’,
’h’, and ’d’ tags
specify ’’minutes’’ (the default),
’’hours’’, and
’’days’’. The ’l’
tag specifies ’’lines’’ and will
cause timestamps of the form ’’[Mon Jan 25
14:46:56 PST 1999]’’ to be placed every
number lines (a newline character signifies a new
line). So, ’’5h’’ specifies every
five hours and ’’2l’’ specifies
every two lines. An ’a’ can be specified
to add logs of ’’attached’’,
’’detached’’, and
’’bumped’’ actions, including the
user’s name and the host from which the client
connection was made. A ’b’ can be
specified to add logging of break sequences sent to the
console.

type
device|ipmi|exec|host|noop|uds

Set the type of console. A type
of ’’device’’ should be used
for local serial ports (also set the device value). A
type of ’’ipmi’’ should be
used for IPMI serial over LAN consoles (also set the
host value and possibly the username,
password, and ipmi* values). A type of
’’exec’’ should be used for
command invocations (perhaps also set the exec
value). A type of ’’host’’
should be used for terminal servers and other TCP
socket-based interaction (also set the host and
port values). A type of
’’noop’’ should be used as a
placeholder - it does nothing, ignores any logfile
value and forces the !nologin option (so you might
want to set the motd value). A type of
’’uds’’ should be used for
Unix domain sockets (also set the uds option).

uds filename

Assign the Unix domain socket
filename as the path to the console. Only consoles of
type ’’uds’’ will use this
value.

udssubst
c=t[n]f[,...]|""

Perform character substitutions
on the uds value. See the devicesubst option
for an explanation of the format string. If the null string
(’’""’’) is used,
no replacements will be done.

username
username|""

Use username during IPMI
authentication. If the null string
(’’""’’) is used
(the default), the ’’null’’ user
will be used.

group name

Define a user group identified
as name. 
users
[!]username[,...]|""

Define a list of users making
up the group name. If username matches a
previously defined group name, all members of the previous
group are applied to the current group (with access reversed
if prefixed with a ’!’). If username
doesn’t match a previously defined group and
username begins with ’@’, the name (minus
the ’@’) is checked against the host’s
group database. All users found in the group will be
recorded with (or without, if prefixed with ’!’)
access. If username doesn’t match a previous
group and doesn’t begin with ’@’, the
users will be recorded with (or without, if prefixed with
’!’) access. If the null string
(’’""’’) is used,
any users previously defined for this group are removed.

task c

Define a task where c is a lowercase alphanumeric
(0-9a-z). Tasks are invoked via the
’’^Ec!c’’ client escape
sequence. 

cmd
command|""

Invoke command on the
server when instructed by the client. All file descriptors
are closed, except for stderr (which is inherited from the
server). The command is passed as an argument to
’’/bin/sh -ce’’ and is a
’’fire and forget’’ methodology (you
need to check logs for any issues). If the null string
(’’""’’) is used,
the entire task definition is ignored.

confirm
yes|true|on|no|false|off

Set whether or not to ask the
client for confirmation before invoking the task. The
default is ’’no’’.

description
string

Set a description for the task.
When a client lists tasks, string will be printed
instead of the command defined above. If the null string
(’’""’’) is used,
the command defined above will be printed.

runas
[user][:group]|""

By default, the command invoked
by cmd is run with the same privileges as the server.
If the server is running with root privileges, this option
resets the user and/or group of the invoked process to
user and group respectively. user may
be a username or numeric uid and group may be a group
name or numeric gid. Either one is optional. If the server
is not running with root privileges, these values are not
used. If the null string
(’’""’’) is
specified, the default of running with the same privileges
as the server is restored.

subst
c=t[n]f[,...]|""

Perform character substitutions
on the cmd value. See the devicesubst option
for an explanation of the format string. If the null string
(’’""’’) is used,
no replacements will be done.
