NAME

xpdf - Portable
Document Format (PDF) file viewer for X (xpopple)

SYNOPSIS

xpdf
[options] [PDF-file [page | +dest]]

DESCRIPTION

xpopple
is a viewer for Portable Document Format (PDF) files. (These
are also sometimes also called ’Acrobat’ files,
from the name of Adobe’s PDF software.) xpopple runs
under the X Window System on UNIX.

xpopple uses
the Poppler library to process PDF files. Poppler was
originally derived from version 3 of Glyph & Cog,
LLC’s Xpdf suite, but Poppler doesn’t include
the Xpdf viewer program itself. xpopple is the Xpdf program,
modified to use Poppler.

To run xpopple,
simply type:

xpdf
file.pdf

where
file.pdf is your PDF file. The file name can be
followed by a number specifying the page which should be
displayed first, e.g.:

xpdf file.pdf
18

You can also
give a named destination, prefixed with ’+’ in
place of the page number. (This is only useful with PDF
files that provide named destination targets.)

You can also
start xpdf without opening any files:

xpdf

Various
compressed formats (gz, bz2, xz, and Z) are also supported,
for example::

xpdf
file.pdf.gz

CONFIGURATION FILE

Xpdf reads a
configuration file at startup. It first tries to find the
user’s private config file, ~/.xpdfrc. If that
doesn’t exist, it looks for a system-wide config file,
/etc/xpdf/xpdfrc. See the xpdfrc(5) man page for
details.

OPTIONS

Many of the
following options can be set with configuration file
commands or X resources. These are listed in square brackets
with the description of the corresponding command line
option. 
-g geometry

Set the initial window
geometry. (-geometry is equivalent.) [X resource:
Xpdf.geometry]

-title title

Set the window title. By
default, the title will be "xpdf: foo.pdf". [X
resource: Xpdf.title]

-cmap

Install a private colormap. This is ignored on TrueColor
visuals. [X resource: Xpdf.installCmap]

-rgb number

Set the size of largest RGB
cube xpdf will try to allocate. The default is 5 (for a
5x5x5 cube); set to a smaller number to conserve color table
entries. This is ignored with private colormaps and on
TrueColor visuals. [X resource: Xpdf.rgbCubeSize]

-rv

Set reverse video mode. This reverses the colors of
everything except images. It may not always produce great
results for PDF files which do weird things with color. This
also causes the paper color to default to black. [X
resource: Xpdf.reverseVideo]

-papercolor
color

Set the "paper
color", i.e., the background of the page display. This
will not work too well with PDF files that do things like
filling in white behind the text. [X resource:
Xpdf.paperColor]

-mattecolor
color

Set the matte color, i.e., the
color used for background outside the actual page area.
(There is a separate setting, Xpdf.fullScreenMatteColor, for
full-screen mode.) [X resource: Xpdf.matteColor]

-z zoom

Set the initial zoom factor. A
number specifies a zoom percentage, where 100 means 72 dpi.
You may also specify 'page’, to fit the page to the
window size, or 'width’, to fit the page width to the
window width, or 'height’, to fit the page height to
the window height [config file: initialZoom; or X
resource: Xpdf.initialZoom]

-cont

Start in continuous view mode, i.e., with one vertical
scroll bar for the whole document. [config file:
continuousView] 

-ps PS-file

Set the default file name for
PostScript output (i.e., the name which will appear in the
print dialog). This can also be of the form ’|
command’ to pipe the PostScript through a command.
[config file: psFile]

-paper size

Set the paper size to one of
"letter", "legal", "A4", or
"A3". This can also be set to "match",
which will set the paper size to match the size specified in
the PDF file. [config file: psPaperSize]

-paperw size

Set the paper width, in points.
[config file: psPaperSize]

-paperh size

Set the paper height, in
points. [config file: psPaperSize]

-level1

Generate Level 1 PostScript.
The resulting PostScript files will be significantly larger
(if they contain images), but will print on Level 1
printers. This also converts all images to black and white.
[config file: psLevel]

-enc
encoding-name

Sets the encoding to use for
text output. The encoding-name must be defined with
the unicodeMap command (see xpdfrc(5)). This defaults
to "Latin1" (which is a built-in encoding).
[config file: textEncoding]

-opw password

Specify the owner password for
the PDF file. Providing this will bypass all security
restrictions.

-upw password

Specify the user password for
the PDF file.

-fullscreen

Open xpdf in full-screen mode,
useful for presentations.

-pagecmd
command

Run a shell command each time a
new page is displayed, with the page number as an argument.
This can be used for presentation recording. [config file:
pageCommand]

-remote name

Start/contact xpdf remote
server with specified name (see the REMOTE SERVER
MODE section below).

-exec command

Execute a command (see the
COMMANDS section below) in an xpdf remote server
window (with -remote only).

-reload

Reload xpdf remote server
window (with -remote only).

-raise

Raise xpdf remote server window (with -remote only).

-quit

Kill xpdf remote server (with -remote only).

-cmd

Print commands as they’re executed (useful for
debugging). [config file: printCommands]

-q

Don’t print any messages or errors. [config file:
errQuiet] 

-cfg
config-file

Read config-file in
place of ~/.xpdfrc or the system-wide config file.

-v

Print copyright and version information.

-h

Print usage information. (-help, --help
and -? are equivalent.)

-m file1 file2
...

Open multiple pdf files:
file1 file2 ... etc. NOTE: The list of files is
terminated once an argument starting with a dash is
encountered. In order to view file names starting with a
dash, simply prepend "./". -m may be used
multiple times.

Several other
standard X options and resources will work as expected:

-display display

[X resource:
Xpdf.display]

-fg color

(-foreground is
equivalent.) [X resource: xpdf*Foreground]

-bg color

(-background is
equivalent.) [X resource: xpdf*Background]

-font font

Override the fonts used for the
user interface. This uses a single X core font for all user
interface elements, which is not ideal; see the USER
INTERFACE FONTS section below for better approaches.
(-fn is equivalent.) [X resource:
xpdf*font]

The color and
font options only affect the user interface elements, not
the PDF display (the ’paper’).

The following X
resources do not have command line option equivalents:

Xpdf.toolTipEnable

Enables (if set to true) or
disables (if set to false) the tool-tips on the toolbar
buttons.

Xpdf.fullScreenMatteColor

Sets the matte color to be used
in full-screen mode. The default setting is
"black".

OBSOLETE OPTIONS

The following
command line options were accepted by earlier versions of
Xpdf but are no longer allowed. In most cases, this is
because they control rendering options that Poppler does not
support. 
-aa yes | no

Obsolete. Controlled the use of
font anti-aliasing in the PDF rasterizer.

-aaVector yes |
no

Obsolete. Controlled the use of
vector anti-aliasing in the PDF rasterizer.

-eol unix | dos |
mac

Obsolete. Set the end-of-line
convention to use for text output.

-freetype yes |
no

Obsolete. Controlled whether
FreeType was used for font rasterization.

-t1lib yes |
no

Obsolete. Controlled whether
t1lib was used for font rasterization.

CONTROLS

On-screen
controls, at the bottom of the xpdf window 
left/right arrow buttons

Move to the previous/next
page.

double left/right arrow
buttons

Move backward or forward by ten
pages.

dashed left/right arrow
buttons

Move backward or forward along
the history path.

’Page’ entry
box

Bring up a dialog for
generating a PostScript file. The dialog has options to set
the pages to be printed and the PostScript file name. The
file name can be ’-’ for stdout or ’|
command’ to pipe the PostScript through a command,
e.g., ’| lpr’.

’?’
button

Bring up the ’about
xpdf’ window.

link info

The space between the
’?’ and ’Quit’ buttons is used to
show the URL or external file name when the mouse is over a
link.

’Quit’
button

Quit xpdf.

Menu

Pressing the right mouse button will post a popup menu with
the following commands: 
Open...

Open a new PDF file via a file
requester.

Open in new
window...

Create a new window and open a
new PDF file via a file requester.

Reload

Reload the current PDF file. Note that Xpdf will reload
the file automatically (on a page change or redraw) if it
has changed since it was last loaded.

Save as...

Save the current file via a
file requester.

Continuous view

Toggles between single page and
continuous view modes.

Rotate
counterclockwise

Rotate the page 90 degrees
counterclockwise.

Rotate clockwise

Rotate the page 90 degrees
clockwise. The two rotate commands are intended primarily
for PDF files where the rotation isn’t correctly
specified in the file.

Zoom to selection

Zoom in to the currently
selected rectangle.

Close

Close the current window. If this is the only open
window, the document is closed, but the window is left open
(i.e., this menu command won’t quit xpdf).

Quit

Quit xpdf.

Outline

If the PDF contains an outline (a.k.a., bookmarks), there
will be an outline pane on the left side of the window. The
width of the outline pane is adjustable with a vertical
split bar via the knob near its bottom end.

Text
selection 
Dragging the mouse with the left button held down will
highlight an arbitrary rectangle. Any text inside this
rectangle will be copied to the X selection buffer.

Links

Clicking on a hyperlink will jump to the link’s
destination. A link to another PDF document will make xpdf
load that document. A ’launch’ link to an
executable program will display a dialog, and if you click
’ok’, execute the program. URL links call an
external command (see the WEB BROWSERS section
below).

Panning

Dragging the mouse with the middle button held down pans the
window.

WEB BROWSERS

If you want to
run xpdf automatically from netscape or mosaic (and probably
other browsers) when you click on a link to a PDF file, you
need to edit (or create) the files .mime.types and
.mailcap in your home directory. In
.mime.types add the line:

application/pdf
pdf

In
.mailcap add the lines:

# Use xpdf to
view PDF files. 
application/pdf; xpdf -q %s

Make sure that
xpdf is on your executable search path.

When you click
on a URL link in a PDF file, xpdf will execute the command
specified by the urlCommand config file option, replacing an
occurrence of ’%s’ with the URL. For example, to
call netscape with the URL, add this line to your config
file:

urlCommand
"netscape -remote ’openURL(%s)’"

COMMANDS

Xpdf’s
key and mouse bindings are user-configurable, using the bind
and unbind options in the config file (see
xpdfrc(5)). The bind command allows you to bind a key
or mouse button to a sequence of one or more commands.

equivalent:

bind h any
scrollLeft(16) 
bind l any scrollRight(16) 
bind k any scrollUp(16) 
bind j any scrollDown(16)

REMOTE SERVER MODE

Xpdf can be
started in remote server mode by specifying a server name
(in addition to the file name and page number). For
example:

xpdf -remote
myServer file.pdf

If there is
currently no xpdf running in server mode with the name
’myServer’, a new xpdf window will be opened. If
another command:

xpdf -remote
myServer another.pdf 9

is issued, a
new copy of xpdf will not be started. Instead, the first
xpdf (the server) will load another.pdf and display
page nine. If the file name is the same:

xpdf -remote
myServer another.pdf 4

the xpdf server
will simply display the specified page.

The -raise
option tells the server to raise its window; it can be
specified with or without a file name and page number.

The -quit
option tells the server to close its window and exit.

USER INTERFACE FONTS

In order to
support international text in user interface elements, xpdf
uses the support for UTF-8 and Xft fonts that was introduced
in OpenMotif 2.3.

The user
interface makes use of four fonts which are specified using
Motif Render Tables: default for most text,
mono for text in a monospaced font, and
helpHuge and helpBig for headings in the About
dialog. The fonts used can be customised using X resources.
By default, they are configured as follows:

Xpdf*renderTable.default.fontType:
FONT_IS_XFT 
Xpdf*renderTable.default.fontName: Sans-Serif 
Xpdf*renderTable.default.fontSize: 12 
Xpdf*renderTable.default.fontEncoding: iso10646-1 
Xpdf*renderTable.helpHuge.fontType: FONT_IS_XFT 
Xpdf*renderTable.helpHuge.fontName: Serif 
Xpdf*renderTable.helpHuge.fontStyle: bold 
Xpdf*renderTable.helpHuge.fontSize: 20 
Xpdf*renderTable.helpHuge.fontEncoding: iso10646-1 
Xpdf*renderTable.helpBig.fontType: FONT_IS_XFT 
Xpdf*renderTable.helpBig.fontName: Serif 
Xpdf*renderTable.helpBig.fontSize: 16 
Xpdf*renderTable.helpBig.fontEncoding: iso10646-1 
Xpdf*renderTable.mono.fontType: FONT_IS_XFT 
Xpdf*renderTable.mono.fontName: Monospace 
Xpdf*renderTable.mono.fontSize: 12 
Xpdf*renderTable.mono.fontEncoding: iso10646-1

If you prefer
to use X core fonts, as in earlier versions of xpdf, you can
specify these using conventional resources, provided that
you use fonts with the "iso10646-1" Unicode
charset:

Xpdf*font:
-*-helvetica-medium-r-normal-*-12-*-*-*-*-*-iso10646-1 
Xpdf*XmTextField.font:
-*-courier-medium-r-normal-*-12-*-*-*-*-*-iso10646-1

EXIT CODES

Xpdf uses the
following exit codes:

0

No error.

1

Error opening a PDF file.

99

Other error.
