NAME

key.dns_resolver.conf
- Kernel DNS resolver config

DESCRIPTION

This file is
used by the key.dns_resolver(5) program to set parameters.
Unless otherwise overridden with the -c flag, the
program reads:

/etc/key.dns_resolver.conf

Configuration
options are given in key[=value] form, where
value is optional. If present, the value may be
surrounded by a pair of single (&rsquo;&rsquo;) or double
quotes ("") which will be stripped off. The
special characters in the value may be escaped with a
backslash to turn them into ordinary characters.

Lines beginning
with a &rsquo;#&rsquo; are considered comments and ignored.
A &rsquo;#&rsquo; symbol anywhere after the &rsquo;=&rsquo;
makes the rest of the line into a comment unless the
&rsquo;#&rsquo; is inside a quoted section or is
escaped.

Leading and
trailing spaces and spaces around the &rsquo;=&rsquo; symbol
will be stripped off.

Available
options include: 
default_ttl=

The number of seconds to set as
the expiration on a cached record. This will be overridden
if the program manages to retrieve TTL information along
with the addresses (if, for example, it accesses the DNS
directly). The default is 5 seconds. The value must be in
the range 1 to INT_MAX.

The file can
also include comments beginning with a &rsquo;#&rsquo;
character unless otherwise suppressed by being inside a
quoted value or being escaped with a backslash.
