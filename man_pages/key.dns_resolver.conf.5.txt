NAME
       key.dns_resolver.conf - Kernel DNS resolver config

DESCRIPTION
       This file is used by the key.dns_resolver(5) program to set parameters.
       Unless otherwise overridden with the -c flag, the program reads:

              /etc/key.dns_resolver.conf

       Configuration options are given in key[=value] form, where value is op‐
       tional.   If  present,  the value may be surrounded by a pair of single
       ('') or double quotes ("") which will be  stripped  off.   The  special
       characters  in  the  value may be escaped with a backslash to turn them
       into ordinary characters.

       Lines beginning with a '#' are considered comments and ignored.  A  '#'
       symbol anywhere after the '=' makes the rest of the line into a comment
       unless the '#' is inside a quoted section or is escaped.

       Leading and trailing spaces and spaces around the '='  symbol  will  be
       stripped off.

       Available options include:

       default_ttl=<number>
              The  number  of  seconds  to  set  as the expiration on a cached
              record.  This will be overridden if the program manages  to  re‐
              trieve  TTL  information along with the addresses (if, for exam‐
              ple, it accesses the DNS directly).  The default is  5  seconds.
              The value must be in the range 1 to INT_MAX.

       The  file  can also include comments beginning with a '#' character un‐
       less otherwise suppressed by being inside a quoted value or  being  es‐
       caped with a backslash.
