PTHREAD_SPIN_UNLOCK(3POSIX)POSIX Programmer's ManuaPTHREAD_SPIN_UNLOCK(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       pthread_spin_unlock — unlock a spin lock object

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pthread.h>

       int pthread_spin_unlock(pthread_spinlock_t *lock);

DESCRIPTION
       The pthread_spin_unlock() function shall release the spin  lock  refer‐
       enced   by  lock  which  was  locked  via  the  pthread_spin_lock()  or
       pthread_spin_trylock() functions.

       The results are undefined if the  lock  is  not  held  by  the  calling
       thread.

       If there are threads spinning on the lock when pthread_spin_unlock() is
       called, the lock becomes available and an unspecified  spinning  thread
       shall acquire the lock.

       The results are undefined if this function is called with an uninitial‐
       ized thread spin lock.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, the  pthread_spin_unlock()  function  shall
       return  zero;  otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate
       the error.

ERRORS
       This function shall not return an error code of [EINTR].

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       None.

RATIONALE
       If an implementation detects that the value specified by the lock argu‐
       ment  to  pthread_spin_unlock()  does  not refer to an initialized spin
       lock object, it is recommended that the function should fail and report
       an [EINVAL] error.

       If an implementation detects that the value specified by the lock argu‐
       ment to pthread_spin_unlock() refers to a spin lock  object  for  which
       the  current  thread does not hold the lock, it is recommended that the
       function should fail and report an [EPERM] error.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
