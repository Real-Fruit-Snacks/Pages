Lintian::Profile(3)         Debian Package Checker         Lintian::Profile(3)

NAME
       Lintian::Profile - Profile parser for Lintian

SYNOPSIS
        my $profile = Lintian::Profile->new ('debian');

DESCRIPTION
       Lintian::Profile handles finding, parsing and implementation of Lintian
       Profiles as well as loading the relevant Lintian checks.

INSTANCE METHODS
       $prof->known_aliases()
           Returns a hash with old names that have new names.

       $prof->profile_list
           Returns a list ref of the (normalized) names of the profile and its
           parents.  The first element of the list is the name of the profile
           itself, the second is its parent and so on.

           Note: This list is a reference. The contents should not be
           modified.

       our_vendor
       $prof->name
           Returns the name of the profile, which may differ from the name
           used to create this instance of the profile (e.g. due to symlinks).

       load ([$profname[, $ipath[, $extra]]])
           Loads a new profile.  $profname is the name of the profile and
           $ipath is a list reference containing the path to one (or more)
           Lintian "roots".

           If $profname is "undef", the default vendor will be loaded based on
           Dpkg::Vendor::get_current_vendor.

           If $ipath is not given, a default one will be used.

       $prof->known_tags
       $prof->enabled_tags
       $prof->get_tag ($name)
           Returns the Lintian::Tag for $tag if known.  Otherwise it returns
           undef.

       get_current_name
       set_durable ($tag)
       $prof->is_durable ($tag)
           Returns a false value if the tag has been marked as "non-
           overridable".  Otherwise it returns a truth value.

       $prof->known_checks
       $prof->enabled_checks
       $prof->enable_tag ($name)
           Enables a tag.

       $prof->disable_tag ($name)
           Disable a tag.

       read_profile
       display_level_for_tag
       tag_is_enabled(TAG)
       display(OPERATION, RELATION, VISIBILITY)
           Configure which tags are displayed by visibility.  OPERATION is "+"
           to display the indicated tags, "-" to not display the indicated
           tags, or "=" to not display any tags except the indicated ones.
           RELATION is one of "<", "<=", "=", ">=", or ">".  The OPERATION
           will be applied to all values of visibility that match the given
           RELATION on the VISIBILITY argument.  If either of those arguments
           are undefined, the action applies to any value for that variable.
           For example:

               $tags->display('=', '>=', 'error');

           turns off display of all tags and then enables display of any tag
           of visibility error or higher.

               $tags->display('+', '>', 'warning');

           adds to the current configuration display of all tags with a
           visibility higher than warning.

               $tags->display('-', '=', 'info');

           turns off display of tags of visibility info.

           This method throws an exception on errors, such as an unknown
           visibility or an impossible constraint (like "> serious").
