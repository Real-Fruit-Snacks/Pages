NAME
       gp-display-text - display the performance data in plain text format

SYNOPSIS
       gprofng  display  text [OPTION(S)] [COMMAND(S)] [-script <script_file>]
       EXPERIMENT(S)

DESCRIPTION
       Print a plain  text  version  of  the  various  displays  supported  by
       gprofng.

OPTIONS
       --version
              print the version number and exit.

       --help print usage information and exit.

       --verbose {on|off}
              enable (on) or disable (off) verbose mode; the default is "off".

       -script <script-file>
              execute the commands stored in the script file; this feature may
              be combined with commands specified at the command line.

COMMANDS
       This tool supports a rich set of commands to control the display of the
       data;  instead  of,  or  in  addition to, including these commands in a
       script file, it is also allowed to include such commands at the command
       line; in this case, the commands need to be prepended with the "-" sym‐
       bol; the commands are processed and interpreted left from right, so the
       order  matters; The gprofng manual documents the commands that are sup‐
       ported.

       If this tool is invoked without options, commands, or a script file, it
       starts in interpreter mode. The user can then issue the commands inter‐
       actively; the session is terminated with the "exit" command in the  in‐
       terpreter.

DOCUMENTATION
       A  getting started guide for gprofng is maintained as a Texinfo manual.
       If the info and gprofng programs are properly installed at  your  site,
       the command "info gprofng" should give you access to this document.
