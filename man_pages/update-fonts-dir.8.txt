NAME

update&minus;fonts&minus;dir
&minus; compile fonts.dir files

SYNOPSIS

update&minus;fonts&minus;dir
[OPTION] directory ...

DESCRIPTION

update&minus;fonts&minus;dir
creates a fonts.dir file in an X font directory by
invoking mkfontdir(1x) with the appropriate
arguments. It is typically invoked only from the
post&minus;installation and post&minus;removal scripts of a
package containing fonts for the X Window System, but
may be invoked at any time to reconstruct fonts.dir
files. For each directory, which is simply the last
component of its path (such as &rsquo;75dpi&rsquo; or
&rsquo;misc&rsquo;), update&minus;fonts&minus;dir
will generate either
/usr/lib/X11/fonts/directory/fonts.dir or
/usr/share/fonts/X11/directory/fonts.dir from
the fonts.scale and font files found within it.

This enables
multiple packages to provide names for fonts in the same
directory. No font package actually provides the
fonts.dir file in the X font directory itself, so
there is no danger of overwriting one package&rsquo;s font
names with those of another.

For instance,
the two packages &rsquo;xfonts&minus;base&rsquo; (real) and
&rsquo;xfonts&minus;nifty&rsquo; (hypothetical) may both
install fonts into the directory
/usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc, and
update&minus;fonts&minus;dir will ensure that the
fonts.dir file in that directory contains information
about the font files provided by both packages.

The format of
fonts.dir files is described in the
mkfontdir(1x) manual page.

An example of
how to use update&minus;fonts&minus;dir in package
maintainer scripts is provided in the Debian Policy
Manual.

OPTIONS

&minus;h,
&minus;&minus;help displays a brief usage message and
exits.

&minus;7,
&minus;&minus;x11r7&minus;layout switches the font
layout to the one introduced in X11R7: fonts in
/usr/share/fonts/X11/directory (default is: fonts in
/usr/lib/X11/fonts/directory)

OPERANDS

update&minus;fonts&minus;dir
takes one or more X font directory names to operate on as
operands. Only the final path component of the directory
name should be specified; e.g.,

update&minus;fonts&minus;dir
75dpi

is correct, while
&rsquo;update&minus;fonts&minus;dir
/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi&rsquo; and
&rsquo;update&minus;fonts&minus;dir
/usr/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi&rsquo; are not.

ENVIRONMENT

COLUMNS

indicates the width of the
terminal device in character cells. This value is used for
formatting diagnostic messages. If not set, the terminal is
queried using stty(1) to determine its width. If that
fails, a value of &rsquo;80&rsquo; is assumed.

DIAGNOSTICS

Errors 
usage error: one or more font directories must be
provided

update&minus;fonts&minus;dir
was invoked without operands. Supply one or more X font
directory names to operate on.

usage error: unrecognized
option

update&minus;fonts&minus;dir
was invoked with an unrecognized option argument. Use only
the options documented in &ldquo;OPTIONS&rdquo;, above.

fatal error: path to X font
directory must be used

A directory name was supplied
that was not an X font directory name. Supply X font
directory names only.

Warnings

warning: absolute path directory was
provided

Usage of absolute paths is
deprecated. Use only the final component of the X font
directory name for directory.

warning:
directory does not exist or is not a
directory

The supplied directory
was invalid. update&minus;fonts&minus;dir skipped
it.

0

update&minus;fonts&minus;dir
ran successfully.

update&minus;fonts&minus;dir experienced a fatal
error; see the section on diagnostic messages above.
