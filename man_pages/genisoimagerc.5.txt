NAME
       genisoimagerc - startup configuration file for genisoimage

DESCRIPTION
       genisoimage(1)  searches for a configuration file in several places; it
       uses the first one it is able to open.  First, if the GENISOIMAGERC en‐
       vironment  variable is set, its value is used as the filename; likewise
       for the MKISOFSRC environment variable.  Next,  genisoimage  looks  for
       files  named .genisoimagerc or .mkisofsrc, first in the current working
       directory, then in the user's  home  directory.   Next,  it  looks  for
       /etc/genisoimagerc.  Finally, it looks for a .genisoimagerc in the same
       directory as genisoimage itself is stored.

       The .genisoimagerc file contains lines of the form

              TAG=value

       where TAG is one of the settings defined below.  The case of the tag is
       not  significant.   All  settings have command-line equivalents; if the
       command-line parameter is specified, it takes priority over the config‐
       uration file.

       Blank lines and lines beginning with `#' are ignored.
