EXICYCLOG(8)                System Manager's Manual               EXICYCLOG(8)

NAME
       exicyclog - Cycle exim's logfiles

SYNOPSIS
       eximcyclog

DESCRIPTION
       The  exicyclog script can be used to cycle (rotate) mainlog and reject‐
       log files.  This is not necessary if only syslog is being  used.   Some
       operating  systems  have their own standard mechanisms for log cycling,
       and these can be used instead of exicyclog if preferred.

       Each time exicyclog is run the file names get ‘shuffled down’  by  one.
       If  the main log file name is mainlog (the default) then when exicyclog
       is run mainlog becomes  mainlog.01,  the  previous  mainlog.01  becomes
       mainlog.02  and  so  on,  up to a limit which is set in the script, and
       which defaults to 10.  Reject logs are handled similarly.

       If no mainlog file exists, the script does nothing.  Files  that  ‘drop
       off’  the  end are deleted.  All files with numbers greater than 01 are
       compressed, using a compression command which is configured by the COM‐
       PRESS_COMMAND  setting  in  Local/Makefile.  It is usual to run “exicy‐
       clog” daily from a root “crontab” entry of the form

         1 0 * * * su exim -c /usr/exim/bin/exicyclog

       assuming you have used the name ‘exim’ for the Exim user.  You can  run
       exicyclog as root if you wish, but there is no need.

BUGS
       This  manual page needs a major re-work. If somebody knows better groff
       than us and has more experience in writing manual  pages,  any  patches
       would be greatly appreciated.
