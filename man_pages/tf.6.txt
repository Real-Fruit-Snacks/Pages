NAME

tf &minus;
TinyFugue, a MUD client

SYNOPSIS

tf
[-ffile] [-lnq] [world] 
tf [-ffile] host port

DESCRIPTION

TinyFugue
(also known as "Fugue" or "TF") is a
line-based client designed for connecting to MUD servers
(note: LP, DIKU, and other servers which use prompts require
"/lp on"; see /help prompts).

Most of the
TF documentation is in the help file, which may be
read online with the "/help" command. This manual
page may be obsolete in certain areas; however, the helpfile
will always be up to date.

TinyFugue
is larger than most MUD clients, but has many more features
and is much more flexible. The goal is to provide the most
functionality in a client that still maintains the
user-friendliness of Tinytalk. Clients with extension
languages such as Tcltt or VaporTalk can do a
little more in certain areas, but are considerably harder to
use and learn. TF provides most of these abilities in
such a manner that learning to use any one function is
relatively easy.

Because I am
continually adding new features and changing the code,
TF sometimes becomes less stable in a new release.
Versions labled "alpha" are generally not as well
tested as "beta" versions, so they have the
potential for more bugs. For this reason, I leave some older
versions at the ftp site where I distribute TF
(ftp.tcp.com), which do not have all the current features
but may have fewer bugs than the most recent release.

COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS

With no
arguments, TF will try to connect to the first world
defined in the configuration file(s).

With a
world argument, TF will try to connect to
world, as defined in the configuration file. If
world is omitted, it will try to connect to the first
world defined in your configuration files.

With
host and port arguments, TF will define
a temporary world and try to connect to it. The host
may be an IP number or regular name format.

OPTIONS

-ffile

Load file instead of $HOME/.tfrc at startup.

-f

Do not load any personal configuration file. The library
will still be loaded.

-l

Disable automatic login.

-n

Do not connect to any world at startup.

-q

Quiet login (overrides %{quiet} flag).

FEATURES

Among other
things, TF allows you to:

Divide the
screen into two parts, for input and output, with flexible
handling of input (/visual mode).

Connect to
multiple worlds and switch between them.

Wrap MUD output
at the edge of the screen.

Edit text in
the input buffer.

Recall previous
commands.

Modify key
sequences used to perform editing functions.

Bind commands
to key sequences.

Define complex
macros to perform MUD tasks easily.

Create triggers
which automatically perform certain tasks when certain
output is received from the MUD.

Modify existing
macros using either a command format or interactive
editing.

Support
"portals" that automatically switch from world to
world.

Hilite or color
all or part of a line that matches a certain pattern.

Gag lines that
match certain patterns.

Suppress
frequently repeated text ("spamming").

Automatically
log into a character on a world.

Send a text
file to the MUD in flexible ways, or echo it locally.

Send the output
of a system command to the MUD, or echo it locally.

Send text
previously received from the MUD to the MUD, or echo it
locally.

Repeat a MUD or
TF command a number of times.

Do the above
four things at varying intervals, or at a rapid-fire
rate.

Log a session
to a file.

Separate LP and
Diku style prompts from normal output.

Page output
using a --More-- prompt.

Recall
previously received text.

Support for Mud
Client Compression Protocol versions 1 and 2.

CONFIGURATION FILES

TF will
attempt to read two files when starting. The first is a
public configuration file "stdlib.tf", located in
TFLIBDIR. TFLIBDIR is defined when TF is installed,
and is often /usr/local/lib/tf.lib, or under the home
directory of the installer. This library contains many
macros and definitions essential to the correct operation of
TF.

Next, TF
will attempt to read your personal configuration file,
$HOME/.tfrc, in which you can put any TF commands you
want executed automatically at startup. Two of the most
useful commands to use in a TF configuration file are
/addworld and /load.

For backward
compatability, TF will also try to read the
TinyTalk configuration file. Its name defautls to
$HOME/.tinytalk, or can be defined by the TINYTALK
environment variable. This file may start with a list of
worlds that will be defined as if with /addworld.

HISTORY

Anton Rang
(Tarrant) in February of 1990 released Tinytalk, the
first Tinyclient with any great number of features,
including hiliting and suppression of text, simple triggers,
and separating input and output on the screen. Leo Plotkin
(Grod) made rather extensive modifications to
Tinytalk to produce Tinywar, which was plagued
with some serious bugs and was never officially released
(the phrase "Tinywar doesn&rsquo;t exist" is often
quoted), and is now an unsupported client. TF began
when Greg Hudson (Explorer_Bob) merged many of the new
features of Tinywar back into TinyTalk, and
added many new features of his own, most notably the split
screen. Some of the code in Greg&rsquo;s releases was
contributed by Leo Plotkin. After Greg moved on to
VaporTalk, Ken Keys (Hawkeye) took over design and
maintenance of TF in July 1991, and continues to make
improvements in features and performance.

The code size
of TF has surpassed 300K (unstripped), and is
signifigantly larger than Tinytalk. It is, in fact,
more than three times the size of a number of existing
servers. As of version 3.0, it has 66 builtin commands and
57 library commands, each documented in the helpfile.

It has been
stated that TF is the most-used client in MUDdom at
the current time. I haven&rsquo;t taken a poll, but I
wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised.

REVIEWS

TF has
significantly changed the tinyclient world. It has a number
of merits and a number of flaws, and has frequently been
criticized (mostly out of boredom; nobody takes this
business too seriously) as having too many features and
being too damn big.

"Tinywar
doesn&rsquo;t exist; TinyFugue merely shouldn&rsquo;t."
-- Coined by Woodlock, I believe.

"TinyFugue
is a work of art." -- Binder, obviously after having
too much to drink.

"TinyFugue
is the biggest hack since the platform it was built
on." -- Explorer_Bob, in one of his lucid moments.

The New York
Times, the Christian Science Monitor and the Washington Post
all refused to comment.

BACKWARD INCOMPATIBILTIES

VERSION 3.2

/rand has been
replaced with rand(). Color names can no longer be user
defined (but color codes still can). The "="
operator does comparison, not assignment.

VERSION 3.1

Added type
argument to WORLD and LOGIN hooks.

VERSION 3.0

Backslashes in
macros are interpreted slightly differently than in previous
versions. Turning on the "backslash" flag will
enable the old behavior.

VERSION 2.1

The CONNECT
hook is now called before the LOGIN hook. In 2.0, CONNECT
was called after autologin.

VERSION 2.0

In versions
prior to 2.0,  was used to scroll the pager;
2.0 uses  as the default, to allow the pager to
be nonblocking.

Tinytalk
style name gags and hilites are no longer supported. You
must use the &rsquo;*&rsquo; wildcard explicitly, as in
&rsquo;/hilite hawkeye*&rsquo;.

Tinytalk
style page and whisper hilites are no longer supported.
However, /hilite_page and /hilite_whisper macros are
provided in the default macro library.

The .tinytalk
file may not be supported in the future; use .tfrc
instead.

The
&rsquo;-&rsquo; command line option in versions prior to 2.0
is no longer supported, and has been replaced with
&rsquo;-l&rsquo;.

BUGS

When
unterbamfing, the old connection should not be closed until
the new connection succeeds.

If a shell
quote (/quote !) reads a partial line from the pipe, the
read will block until the rest of the line is read.

WARNINGS

General has determined that MUDding can be detrimental to
