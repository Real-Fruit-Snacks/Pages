NAME

COMMIT &minus;
commit the current transaction

SYNOPSIS

COMMIT [ WORK |
TRANSACTION ]

DESCRIPTION

COMMIT
commits the current transaction. All changes made by the
transaction become visible to others and are guaranteed to
be durable if a crash occurs.

PARAMETERS

WORK

TRANSACTION

Optional key words. They have
no effect.

NOTES

Use ROLLBACK
[rollback(7)] to abort a transaction.

Issuing
COMMIT when not inside a transaction does no harm,
but it will provoke a warning message.

EXAMPLES

To commit the
current transaction and make all changes permanent:

COMMIT;

COMPATIBILITY

The SQL
standard only specifies the two forms COMMIT and COMMIT
WORK. Otherwise, this command is fully conforming.

[begin(7)], ROLLBACK [rollback(l)]
