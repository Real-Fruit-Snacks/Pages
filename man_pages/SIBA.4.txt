SIBA(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual SIBA(4)

NAME

siba &mdash; Sonic Inc.
Silicon Backplane driver

SYNOPSIS

To compile this driver into the
kernel, add the following lines to the kernel configuration
file:

device bhnd

device siba

To load the
driver as a module at boot, add this line to
loader.conf(5):

siba_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION

The siba driver provides
bhnd(4) support for devices based on the Sonic Inc. Silicon
Backplane, an interblock communications architecture found
in earlier Broadcom Home Networking Division wireless
chipsets and embedded systems.

A common
interconnect connects all of the Silicon Backplane&rsquo;s
functional blocks. These functional blocks, known as cores,
use the Open Core Protocol (OCP) interface to communicate
with agents attached to the Silicon Backplane.

Each core can
have an initiator agent that passes read and write requests
onto the system backplane and a target agent that returns
responses to those requests. Not all cores contain both an
initiator and a target agent. Initiator agents are present
in cores that contain host interfaces (PCI, PCMCIA),
embedded processors (MIPS), or DMA processors associated
with communications cores.

HISTORY

The siba device driver
first appeared in FreeBSD 8.0. The driver was rewritten
for FreeBSD 11.0 to support the common Broadcom bhnd(4)
bus interface.
