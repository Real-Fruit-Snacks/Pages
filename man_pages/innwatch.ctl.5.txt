NAME

innwatch.ctl -
List of supervisory actions taken by innwatch

DESCRIPTION

The file
pathetc/innwatch.ctl is used to determine what
actions are taken during the periodic supervisions by
innwatch.

The file
consists of a series of lines; blank lines and lines
beginning with a number sign ("#") are ignored.
All other lines consist of seven fields, each preceded by a
delimiting character, for example:

!state!when!condition!test!limit!command!reason

or:

@state@when@condition@test@limit@command@reason

The delimiter
can be any one of several non-alphanumeric characters that
does not appear elsewhere in the line; there is no way to
quote it to include it in any of the fields. Any of
"!", ",", ":", "@",
";", or "?" is a good choice. Each line
can have a different delimiter; the first character on each
line is the delimiter for that line. White space surrounding
delimiters, except before the first, is ignored, and does
not form part of the fields; white space within fields is
permitted. All delimiters must be present.

The first field
is the state to enter if the condition for this control line
is true. It is used as an internal state indicator and in
ctlinnd messages to control the server. If this field
is empty, the line number is used.

The second
field specifies when this control line should be used. It
consists of a list of states and special indicators,
separated by whitespace. If the current state matches
against any of the states in this field, this line will be
used as described below. The values that may be used
are:

"-"

This line matches if the current state is the same as
the label on this line, or if the current state is
"run", the initial state. This is also the default
state if this field is empty.

"+"

This line matches if the current state is
"run". 

"*"

This line always matches.

"label"

This line matches if the
current state is the specified "label".

"-label"

This line matches if the
current state is not the specified "label".

The third field
specifies a shell command that is invoked if this line
matches. Do not use any shell filename expansion characters
such as "*", "?", or "[" (even
quoted, they&rsquo;re not likely to work as intended). The
command is executed with its current directory set to the
news spool articles directory (patharticles).

If the command
succeeds, as indicated by its exit status, it is expected to
have printed a single integer to standard output. This gives
the value of this control line, to be used below. If the
command fails, the line is ignored.

The fourth
field specifies the operator to use to test the value
returned above. It should be one of the two letter numeric
test operators defined in test(1) such as "eq",
"lt" and the like. The leading dash
("-") should not be included.

The fifth field
specifies a constant with which to compare the value using
the operator just defined. This is done by invoking the
command:

test value
-operator constant

The line is
said to succeed if it returns true.

The sixth field
specifies what should be done if the line succeeds, and in
some cases if it fails. Any of the following words may be
used: 
"throttle"

Causes innwatch to
throttle the server if this line succeeds. It also sets the
state to the value of the line&rsquo;s label. If the line
fails, and the state was previously equal to the label on
this line (that is, this line had previously succeeded),
then a "ctlinnd go" command will be sent to the
server, and innwatch will return to the
"run" state. The "ctlinnd throttle"
command is only performed if the current state is
"run" or a state other than the label of this
line, regardless of whether the command succeeds.

"pause"

Is identical to
"throttle" except that the server is paused via
the "ctlinnd pause" command.

"shutdown"

Sends a "ctlinnd
shutdown" command to the server. It is for emergency
use only.

"flush"

Sends a "ctlinnd
flush" command to the server.

"go"

Causes innwatch to send
a "ctlinnd go" command to the server and to set
the state to "run".

"exit"

Causes innwatch to
exit.

"skip"

The remainder of the control
file is skipped for the current pass.

The last field
specifies the reason that is used in those
"ctlinnd" commands that require one. More
strictly, it is part of the reason, as innwatch
appends some information to it.

In order to
enable other sites to recognize the state of the local
innd server, this field should usually be set to one
of several standard values. Use for instance "No
space" if the server is rejecting articles because of a
lack of filesystem resources, or "loadav" if the
server is rejecting articles because of a lack of CPU
resources.

Once
innwatch has taken some action as a consequence of
its control line, it skips the rest of the control file for
this pass. If the action was to restart the server (that is,
issue a "ctlinnd go" command), then the next pass
will commence almost immediately, so that innwatch
can discover any other condition that may mean that the
server should be suspended again.

EXAMPLES

!!! inndf . !
lt ! 10000 ! throttle ! No space (spool) 
!!! inndf -i . ! lt ! 1000 ! throttle ! No space
(inodes)

The first line
causes the server to be throttled if the free space drops
below 10000 units (using whatever units inndf uses),
and restarted again when free space increases above the
threshold.

The second line
does the same for inodes.

The next three
lines act as a group and should appear in the following
order. It is easier to explain them, however, if they are
described from the last up.

! load ! load
hiload ! loadavg ! lt ! 5 ! go ! loadav 
: hiload : + load : loadavg : gt : 8 : throttle : loadav

/ load / + / loadavg / gt / 6 / pause / loadav

The final line
causes the server to be paused if innwatch is in the
"run" state and the load average rises to, or
above, six. The state is set to "load" when this
happens. The previous line causes the server to be throttled
when innwatch is in the "run" or
"load" state, and the load average rises above
eight. The state is set to "hiload" when this
happens. Note that innwatch can switch the server
from "pause" to "throttle" if the load
average rises from below six to between six and seven, and
then to above eight. The first line causes the server to be
sent a "ctlinnd go" command if innwatch is
in the "load" or "hiload" state, and the
load average drops below five.

Note that all
three lines assume a mythical command "loadavg"
that is assumed to print the current load average as an
integer. In more practical circumstances, a pipe of
uptime into AWK is more likely to be useful.

BUGS

The
"run" state is not actually identified by the
label with that three letter name, and using it will not
work as expected ("go" is the wanted state in that
case).

Using an
unusual character for the delimiter such as
"(", "*", "&",
"`", "'", and the like, is likely to
lead to obscure and hard to locate bugs.
