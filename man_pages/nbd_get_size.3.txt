NAME

nbd_get_size -
return the export size

SYNOPSIS

#include

int64_t nbd_get_size ( 
struct nbd_handle *h 
);

DESCRIPTION

Returns the
size in bytes of the NBD export.

Note that this
call fails with "EOVERFLOW" for an unlikely server
that advertises a size which cannot fit in a 64-bit signed
integer.

nbdinfo(1)
--size option is a way to access this API from shell
scripts.

This call does
not block, because it returns data that is saved in the
handle from the NBD protocol handshake.

RETURN VALUE

This call
returns a 64 bit signed integer &ge; 0.

ERRORS

On error -1 is
returned.

Refer to
"ERROR HANDLING" in libnbd(3) for how to
get further details of the error.

The following
parameters must not be NULL: "h". For more
information see "Non-NULL parameters" in
libnbd(3).

can be called when the handle is in the following

VERSION

This function
first appeared in libnbd 1.0.

If you need to
test if this function is available at compile time check if
the following macro is defined:

#define
LIBNBD_HAVE_NBD_GET_SIZE 1

EXAMPLE

This example is
also available as examples/get-size.c in the libnbd
source code.

/* This example
shows how to connect to an NBD 
* server and read the size of the disk. 
* 
* You can test it with nbdkit like this: 
* 
* nbdkit -U - memory 1M \ 
* --run './get-size $unixsocket'
