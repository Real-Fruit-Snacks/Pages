podman-image-sign(1)        General Commands Manual       podman-image-sign(1)

NAME
       podman-image-sign - Create a signature for an image

SYNOPSIS
       podman image sign [options] image [image ...]

DESCRIPTION
       podman  image  sign will create a local signature for one or more local
       images that have been pulled from a registry.  The  signature  will  be
       written to a directory derived from the registry configuration files in
       $HOME/.config/containers/registries.d if it exists, otherwise /etc/con‐
       tainers/registries.d  (unless overridden at compile-time), see contain‐
       ers-registries.d(5) for more information.  By  default,  the  signature
       will   be   written  into  /var/lib/containers/sigstore  for  root  and
       $HOME/.local/share/containers/sigstore for non-root users

OPTIONS
   --all, -a
       Sign all the manifests of the multi-architecture image (default false).

   --authfile=path
       Path of the authentication file. Default is ${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/contain‐
       ers/auth.json,  which  is set using podman login.  If the authorization
       state is not found there, $HOME/.docker/config.json is  checked,  which
       is set using docker login.

       Note:  There is also the option to override the default path of the au‐
       thentication file by setting the REGISTRY_AUTH_FILE  environment  vari‐
       able. This can be done with export REGISTRY_AUTH_FILE=path.

   --cert-dir=path
       Use  certificates at path (*.crt, *.cert, *.key) to connect to the reg‐
       istry. (Default: /etc/containers/certs.d) Please refer  to  containers-
       certs.d(5)  for details.  (This option is not available with the remote
       Podman client, including Mac and Windows (excluding WSL2) machines)

   --directory, -d=dir
       Store  the   signatures   in   the   specified   directory.    Default:
       /var/lib/containers/sigstore

   --help, -h
       Print usage statement.

   --sign-by=identity
       Override the default identity of the signature.

EXAMPLES
       Sign  the  busybox image with the identity of foo@bar.com with a user's
       keyring and save the signature in /tmp/signatures/.

       sudo podman image sign --sign-by  foo@bar.com  --directory  /tmp/signa‐
       tures docker://privateregistry.example.com/foobar

       sudo    podman   image   sign   --authfile=/tmp/foobar.json   --sign-by
       foo@bar.com --directory /tmp/signatures  docker://privateregistry.exam‐
       ple.com/foobar

RELATED CONFIGURATION
       The  write  (and read) location for signatures is defined in YAML-based
       configuration  files  in  /etc/containers/registries.d/  for  root,  or
       $HOME/.config/containers/registries.d  for  non-root  users.   When you
       sign an image, Podman will use those configuration files  to  determine
       where  to write the signature based on the name of the originating reg‐
       istry or a default storage value unless overridden with the --directory
       option. For example, consider the following configuration file.

       docker:
         privateregistry.example.com:
           sigstore: file:///var/lib/containers/sigstore

       When  signing  an  image  preceded  with the registry name 'privatereg‐
       istry.example.com', the signature will be written into  sub-directories
       of /var/lib/containers/sigstore/privateregistry.example.com. The use of
       'sigstore' also means the signature will be 'read' from that same loca‐
       tion on a pull-related function.
