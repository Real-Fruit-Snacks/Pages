NAME

overchan -
Batch update the INN overview database

SYNOPSIS

overchan
[file ...]

DESCRIPTION

overchan
reads overview data from the specified files or from
standard input if no files are specified, and writes that
data into the INN overview database. (The file "-"
means to read data from standard input as well.)

Normally,
overview data is stored by innd for articles as
they’re accepted. For performance, however, it’s
sometimes useful to have overview data written by a separate
process. To do this, set useoverchan to true in
inn.conf to tell innd to not write overview
data directly and then add an overchan channel in
newsfeeds:

overview!:*:Tc,WnteO:/overchan

where
 is pathbin in inn.conf.
Additionally, overchan can be used to bulk-load
overview data from appropriately formatted batch files (such
as overflow files from an overchan channel).

Each line of
input should have the following format:

where
 is the storage API token of the article in
textual form (surrounded by "@" characters),
 is the arrival timestamp of the article in
seconds since epoch,  is the expiration time
of the article in seconds since epoch or 0 if there is none,
and  is the tab-separated overview data. Each of
these fields must be separated by a single space.
