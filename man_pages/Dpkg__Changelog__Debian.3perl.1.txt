NAME
       Dpkg::Changelog::Debian - parse Debian changelogs

DESCRIPTION
       This class represents a Debian changelog file as an array of changelog
       entries (Dpkg::Changelog::Entry::Debian).  It implements the generic
       interface Dpkg::Changelog.  Only methods specific to this
       implementation are described below, the rest are inherited.

       Dpkg::Changelog::Debian parses Debian changelogs as described in
       deb-changelog(5).

       The parser tries to ignore most cruft like # or /* */ style comments,
       RCS keywords, Vim modelines, Emacs local variables and stuff from older
       changelogs with other formats at the end of the file.  NOTE: most of
       these are ignored silently currently, there is no parser error issued
       for them. This should become configurable in the future.

METHODS
       $count = $c->parse($fh, $description)
           Read the filehandle and parse a Debian changelog in it, to store
           the entries as an array of Dpkg::Changelog::Entry::Debian objects.
           Any previous entries in the object are reset before parsing new
           data.

           Returns the number of changelog entries that have been parsed with
           success.

CHANGES
