sasl_decode -
Cyrus SASL documentation

SYNOPSIS

#include

int
sasl_decode(sasl_conn_t *conn, 
const char * input, 
unsigned inputlen, 
const char ** output, 
unsigned * outputlen);

DESCRIPTION

int
sasl_decode(sasl_conn_t *conn, 
const char * input, 
unsigned inputlen, 
const char ** output, 
unsigned * outputlen);

sasl_decode decodes data
received. After successful authentication this function
should be called on all data received. It decodes the data
from encrypted or signed form to plain data. If there was no
security layer negotiated the output is identical to
the input. 
Parameters

&bull;

conn &ndash; is the SASL connection context

&bull;

output &ndash; contains the decoded data and is
allocated/freed by the library.

&bull;

outputlen &ndash; length of output.

One should not
give sasl_decode more data than the negotiated
maxbufsize (see sasl_getprop(3)).

Note that
sasl_decode can succeed and outputlen can be zero. If this
is the case simply wait for more data and call sasl_decode
again.

RETURN VALUE

SASL callback
functions should return SASL return codes. See sasl.h for a
complete list. SASL_OK indicates success.

Other return
codes indicate errors and should be handled.
