sssd-session-recording
- Configuring session recording with SSSD

DESCRIPTION

This manual
page describes how to configure sssd(8) to work with
tlog-rec-session(8), a part of tlog package, to
implement user session recording on text terminals. For a
detailed configuration syntax reference, refer to the
&ldquo;FILE FORMAT&rdquo; section of the sssd.conf(5)
manual page.

SSSD can be set
up to enable recording of everything specific users see or
type during their sessions on text terminals. E.g. when
users log in on the console, or via SSH. SSSD itself doesn't
record anything, but makes sure tlog-rec-session is started
upon user login, so it can record according to its
configuration.

For users with
session recording enabled, SSSD replaces the user shell with
tlog-rec-session in NSS responses, and adds a variable
specifying the original shell to the user environment, upon
PAM session setup. This way tlog-rec-session can be started
in place of the user shell, and know which actual shell to
start, once it set up the recording.

CONFIGURATION OPTIONS

These options
can be used to configure the session recording.

scope
(string)

One of the following strings
specifying the scope of session recording:

"none"

No users are recorded.

"some"

Users/groups specified by
users and groups options are recorded.

"all"

All users are recorded.

Default:
"none"

users
(string)

A comma-separated list of users
which should have session recording enabled. Matches user
names as returned by NSS. I.e. after the possible space
replacement, case changes, etc.

Default: Empty.
Matches no users.

groups
(string)

A comma-separated list of
groups, members of which should have session recording
enabled. Matches group names as returned by NSS. I.e. after
the possible space replacement, case changes, etc.

NOTE: using
this option (having it set to anything) has a considerable
performance cost, because each uncached request for a user
requires retrieving and matching the groups the user is
member of.

Default: Empty.
Matches no groups.

exclude_users
(string)

A comma-separated list of users
to be excluded from recording, only applicable with
'scope=all'.

Default: Empty.
No users excluded.

exclude_groups
(string)

A comma-separated list of
groups, members of which should be excluded from recording.
Only applicable with 'scope=all'.

NOTE: using
this option (having it set to anything) has a considerable
performance cost, because each uncached request for a user
requires retrieving and matching the groups the user is
member of.

Default: Empty.
No groups excluded.

EXAMPLE

The following
snippet of sssd.conf enables session recording for users
"contractor1" and "contractor2", and
group "students".

[session_recording]

scope = some 
users = contractor1, contractor2 
groups = students
