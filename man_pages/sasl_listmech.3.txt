SYNOPSIS

#include

int
sasl_listmech(sasl_conn_t *conn, 
const char *user, 
const char *prefix, 
const char *sep, 
const char *suffix, 
const char **result, 
unsigned *plen, 
int *pcount);

DESCRIPTION

int
sasl_listmech(sasl_conn_t *conn, 
const char *user, 
const char *prefix, 
const char *sep, 
const char *suffix, 
const char **result, 
unsigned *plen, 
int *pcount);

sasl_listmech returns a
string listing the SASL names of all the mechanisms
available to the specified user. This is typically given to
the client through a capability command or initial server
response. Client applications need this list so that they
know what mechanisms the server supports. 
Parameters

•

conn – the SASL context for this
connection 

•

user – (optional) restricts the mechanism
list to only those available to the user.

•

prefix – appended to beginning of
result 

•

sep – appended between mechanisms

•

suffix – appended to end of result

•

result – NULL terminated result string
(allocated/freed by library)

•

plen – length of result filled in by
library. May be NULL

•

pcount – Number of mechanisms available
(filled in by library). May be NULL

EXAMPLE

sasl_listmech(conn,NULL,"(",",",")",&mechlist,NULL,NULL);

may give the
following string as a result:

(ANONYMOUS,KERBEROS_V4,DIGEST-MD5)

RETURN VALUE

SASL functions
should return SASL return codes. See sasl.h for a complete
list. SASL_OK indicates success.
