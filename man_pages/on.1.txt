NAME

on −
execute a command on a remote system, but with the local
environment

SYNOPSIS

on
[-i] [-d] [-n] host command
[argument] ...

DESCRIPTION

The on
program is used to execute commands on another system, in an
environment similar to that invoking the program. All
environment variables are passed, and the current working
directory is preserved. To preserve the working directory,
the working file system must be either already mounted on
the host or be exported to it. Relative path names will only
work if they are within the current file system; absolute
path names may cause problems.

The standard
input is connected to the standard input of the remote
command, and the standard output and the standard error from
the remote command are sent to the corresponding files for
the on command.

OPTIONS

-i

Interactive mode. Use remote
echoing and special character processing. This option is
needed for programs that expect to be talking to a terminal.
All terminal modes and window size changes are
propagated. 

-d

Debug mode. Print out some messages as work is being
done. 

-n

No Input. This option causes the remote program to get
EOF when it reads from the standard input, instead of
passing the standard input from the standard input of the
on program. For example, -n is necessary when
running commands in the background with job control.

Host name not found.

cannot connect to
server

Host down or not running the
server.

can’t find

Problem finding the working
directory.

can’t locate mount
point

Problem finding current file
system.

RPC: Authentication
error

The server requires DES
authentication and you do not have a secret key registered
with keyserv. Perhaps you logged in without a password. Try
to keylogin. If that fails try to set your publickey with
chkey.

Other
diagnostic messages may be passed back from the server.

BUGS

When the
working directory is remote mounted over NFS, a
CTRL-Z hangs the window.

Root cannot use
on.
