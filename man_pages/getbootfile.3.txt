GETBOOTFILE(3) BSD Library Functions Manual
GETBOOTFILE(3)

NAME

getbootfile &mdash; get
kernel boot file name

LIBRARY

Standard C Library (libc,
&minus;lc)

SYNOPSIS

#include

const char
*

getbootfile(void);

DESCRIPTION

The getbootfile()
function retrieves the full pathname of the file from which
the current kernel was loaded, and returns a static pointer
to the name. A read/write interface to this information is
available via the sysctl(3) MIB variable
&rsquo;&rsquo;kern.bootfile&rsquo;&rsquo;.

RETURN VALUES

If the call succeeds a string
giving the pathname is returned. If it fails, a null pointer
is returned and an error code is placed in the global
location errno.

SEE ALSO

sysctl(3)

BUGS

If the boot blocks have not been
modified to pass this information into the kernel at boot
time, the static string
&rsquo;&rsquo;/boot/kernel/kernel&rsquo;&rsquo; is
returned instead of the real boot file.

HISTORY

The getbootfile()
function appeared in FreeBSD 2.0.
