NAME
       Image::ExifTool::WriteCanonRaw.pl - Write Canon RAW (CRW and CR2)
       information

SYNOPSIS
       These routines are autoloaded by Image::ExifTool::CanonRaw.

DESCRIPTION
       This file contains routines used by ExifTool to write Canon CRW and CR2
       files and metadata.

NOTES
       The CRW format is a pleasure to work with.  All pointer offsets are
       relative to the start of the data for each directory.  If EXIF/TIFF had
       implemented pointers in this way, it would be MUCH easier to read and
       write TIFF and JPEG files, and would lead to far fewer problems with
       corrupted metadata.
