NAME

nbd_connect_socket
- connect directly to a connected socket

SYNOPSIS

#include

int nbd_connect_socket ( 
struct nbd_handle *h, int sock 
);

DESCRIPTION

Pass a
connected socket "sock" through which libnbd will
talk to the NBD server.

The caller is
responsible for creating and connecting this socket by some
method, before passing it to libnbd.

If this call
returns without error then socket ownership is passed to
libnbd. Libnbd will close the socket when the handle is
closed. The caller must not use the socket in any way.

This call
returns when the connection has been made. By default, this
proceeds all the way to transmission phase, but
nbd_set_opt_mode(3) can be used for manual control
over option negotiation performed before transmission
phase.

RETURN VALUE

If the call is
successful the function returns 0.

ERRORS

On error -1 is
returned.

Refer to
"ERROR HANDLING" in libnbd(3) for how to
get further details of the error.

The following
parameters must not be NULL: "h". For more
information see "Non-NULL parameters" in
libnbd(3).
