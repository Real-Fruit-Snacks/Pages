NAME

rrenumd — router
renumbering daemon

SYNOPSIS

rrenumd
[−df] [

−c conf_file | −s ]

DESCRIPTION

The rrenumd utility
transmits router renumbering request packets, to renumber
the routers in the site network.

On KAME-based
systems, router renumbering requests are received and
processed by rtadvd(8). For other systems, refer to relevant
documents.

The program will
daemonize itself on invocation. It reads configuration
information from standard input if −s is
specified, or from conf_file if −c
conf_file is specified.

The contents of
configuration information are described in
rrenumd.conf(5).

After successful
configuration, rrenumd sends router renumbering
messages periodically to configured destinations. Messages
contain prefixes configured to be renumbered.

−d

Debug mode.

−f

Foreground
mode. Do not become daemon.

−s

Script mode.
Configuration information is obtained from standard
input.

−c
conf_file

Specify a configuration file
where configuration information is kept.

RETURN VALUES

The program exits with 0 on
success, and non-zero on failures.
