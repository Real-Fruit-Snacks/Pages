NAME

dpt-missing-upstream
-- fix missing "upstream" branch and/or tags

SYNOPSIS

dpt
missing-upstream [--skip-missing-snapshots]
[--check-only]

DESCRIPTION

dpt
missing-upstream tries to find releases present in
debian/changelog that have no corresponding tags like
"upstream/x.y.z".

For each
missing tag, an attempt is made to download the upstream
sources from http://snapshot.debian.org/&gt; and then
put them in version control using
gbp-import-orig(1).

If the
"upstream" branch is also not present, it
is either created from the remote repository, or, if it is
not present on the remote repository, created from
scratch.

When all is
done, the "upstream" branch is merged
into "master". Nothing is pushed.

OPTIONS

--check-only

Only report missing tags, do
not try to download sources.

--skip-missing-snapshots

If a given upstream source is
not found even on http://snapshot.debian.org&gt;, just
move on and do not abort execution.
