NAME
       podman-machine-init - Initialize a new virtual machine

SYNOPSIS
       podman machine init [options] [name]

DESCRIPTION
       Initialize a new virtual machine for Podman.

       Rootless only.

       Podman on MacOS and Windows requires a virtual machine. This is because
       containers are Linux - containers do not run on any  other  OS  because
       containers' core functionality are tied to the Linux kernel. Podman ma‐
       chine must be used to manage MacOS and Windows machines, but can be op‐
       tionally used on Linux.

       podman  machine init initializes a new Linux virtual machine where con‐
       tainers are run.  SSH keys are automatically generated  to  access  the
       VM,  and  system connections to the root account and a user account in‐
       side the VM are added.

       By default, the VM distribution is Fedora CoreOS.   Fedora  CoreOS  up‐
       grades  come out every 14 days and are detected and installed automati‐
       cally. The VM will be rebooted during the upgrade.  For  more  informa‐
       tion  on updates and advanced configuration, please see the FCOS update
       docs here and here.

OPTIONS
   --cpus=number
       Number of CPUs.

   --disk-size=number
       Size of the disk for the guest VM in GB.

   --help
       Print usage statement.

   --ignition-path
       Fully qualified path of the ignition file.

       If an ignition file is provided, the  file  will  be  copied  into  the
       user's  CONF_DIR and renamed.  Additionally, no SSH keys will be gener‐
       ated nor will a system connection be made.  It is assumed that the user
       will do these things manually or handle otherwise.

   --image-path
       Fully  qualified path or URL to the VM image.  Can also be set to test‐
       ing, next, or stable to pull down default image.  Defaults to testing.

   --memory, -m=number
       Memory (in MB).

   --now
       Start the virtual machine immediately after it has been initialized.

   --rootful
       Whether this machine should prefer rootful (true) or  rootless  (false)
       container execution. This option will also determine the remote connec‐
       tion default if there is no existing remote connection configurations.

       API forwarding, if available, will follow this setting.

   --timezone
       Set the timezone for the machine and containers.  Valid values are  lo‐
       cal  or a timezone such as America/Chicago.  A value of local, which is
       the default, means to use the timezone of the machine host.

   --username
       Username to use for executing commands in remote VM. Default  value  is
       core  for  FCOS  and user for Fedora (default on Windows hosts). Should
       match the one used inside the resulting VM image.

   --volume, -v=source:target[:options]
       Mounts a volume from source to target.

       Create  a  mount.  If  /host-dir:/machine-dir  is  specified   as   the
       *source:target*,  Podman  mounts host-dir in the host to machine-dir in
       the Podman machine.

       Additional options may be specified as a comma-separated string. Recog‐
       nized  options  are:  *  ro:  mount volume read-only * rw: mount volume
       read/write (default)  *  security_model=[model]:  specify  9p  security
       model (see below)

       The  9p  security  model  [determines] https://wiki.qemu.org/Documenta‐
       tion/9psetup#Starting_the_Guest_directly if and how the  9p  filesystem
       translates  some  filesystem  operations  before  actual storage on the
       host. The default value of mapped-xattr specifies that  9p  store  sym‐
       links and some file attributes as extended attributes on the host. This
       is suitable when the host and the guest do not need to interoperate  on
       the  shared  filesystem,  but has caveats for actual shared access; no‐
       tably, symlinks on the host are not usable on the guest and vice versa.
       If  interoperability is required, then choose none instead, but keep in
       mind that the guest will not be able to do things that the user running
       the virtual machine cannot do, e.g. create files owned by another user.
       Using none is almost certainly the best choice for read-only volumes.

       Example: -v "$HOME/git:$HOME/git:ro,security_model=none"

       Default volume mounts are defined in containers.conf.  Unless  changed,
       the default values is $HOME:$HOME.

   --volume-driver
       Driver to use for mounting volumes from the host, such as virtfs.

              $ podman machine init -v /Users:/mnt/Users
