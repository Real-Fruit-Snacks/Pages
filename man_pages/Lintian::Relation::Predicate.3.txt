NAME
       Lintian::Relation::Predicate - Lintian type for relationship predicates

SYNOPSIS
           use Lintian::Relation::Predicate;

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides functions for parsing and evaluating package
       relationships such as Depends and Recommends for binary packages and
       Build-Depends for source packages.  It parses a relationship into an
       internal format and can then answer questions such as "does this
       dependency require that a given package be installed" or "is this
       relationship a superset of another relationship."
