NAME
       torify - wrapper for torsocks and tor

SYNOPSIS
       torify application [applicationâ€™s arguments]

DESCRIPTION
       torify is a simple wrapper that calls torsocks with a tor-specific
       configuration file.

       It is provided for backward compatibility; instead you should use
       torsocks.

WARNING
       When used with torsocks, torify should not leak DNS requests or UDP
       data.

       torify can leak ICMP data.

       torify will not ensure that different requests are processed on
       different circuits.
