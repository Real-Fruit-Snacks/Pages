NAME

hman - browse
the on-line manual pages

SYNOPSIS

hman [
-P browser ] [ -H host ] [ section ]
name 
hman [ -P browser ] [ -H host ] [
section ] [ index ]

DESCRIPTION

The hman
script is an interface to man2html(1) that allows you to
enter man page requests at the command line and view the
output in your favourite browser. The behaviour reminds of
that of man(1) so that many people will be able to
alias hman to man. If the browser used is
netscape, and an incarnation of netscape is running already,
hman will pass the request to the existing
browser.

OPTIONS

-P
browser

Specify which browser (like
lynx, xmosaic, arena, chimera, netscape, amaya, ...) to use.
This option overrides the MANHTMLPAGER environment
variable. The default is sensible-browser. 
A special value lynxcgi can be used for the non-httpd
version of lynx, but this requires the lynx(1)
command to be installed and approprietly configured.

-H host

Specify from what host to get
the man pages. This option overrides the MANHTMLHOST
environment variable. The default is localhost.

ENVIRONMENT

MANHTMLPAGER

The default browser to use is
selected using this environment variable.

MANHTMLHOST

The default host to use is
selected using this environment variable.
