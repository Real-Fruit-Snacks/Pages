NAME

fnlist &minus;
display the names and references bound in an FNS context

SYNOPSIS

fnlist
[-Alv] [composite_name]

DESCRIPTION

fnlist
displays the names and references bound in the context of
composite_name.

If
composite_name is not provided, the default initial
context is displayed.

OPTIONS

The following
options are supported:

-A

Consult the authoritative source for information.

-l

Display the references as well as the names bound in the
context of composite_name. Without this option, only
the names are displayed.

-v

Display the references in detail. For
onc_fn_* references, this option is useful to
derive the name of the NIS+ table that stores the
reference for every name bound in the context of
composite_name. 

OPERANDS

The following
operand is supported: 
composite_name

An FNS named object.
Composite names, like UNIX file names, depend on the
subcontexts created. Examples of commands with valid
composite_name operands are:

eg% fnlist
thisorgunit 
eg% fnlist thisorgunit/service 
eg% fnlist thisorgunit/service/printer

When FNS
is deployed, the composite name is specific to the deployed
site.

EXAMPLES

Example 1:
Examples of the fnlist command.

In the
following example, the command with no operand provides the
listing with reference and address types for the initial
context:

eg% fnlist
-l

In the
following examples, where a user context is given (that is,
composite_name = user/), FNS must first
be deployed via fncreate(1M), using one of the naming
services NIS, NIS+, or files. If FNS is
not deployed, there are no user contexts and the commands
will fail with the "Name not found" error
message.

The following
command shows the names bound in the context of
user/:

eg% fnlist
user/

The following
command displays the names and references bound in the
context of user/:

eg% fnlist
-l user/

EXIT STATUS

0

Operation was successful.

1

Operation failed.
