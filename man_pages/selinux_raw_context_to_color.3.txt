NAME
       selinux_raw_context_to_color  -  Return RGB color string for an SELinux
       security context

SYNOPSIS
       #include <selinux/selinux.h>

       int selinux_raw_context_to_color(char *raw,
              char **color_str);

DESCRIPTION
       selinux_raw_context_to_color() returns a color_str  associated  to  the
       raw  context  raw provided that the mcstransd(8) daemon is running, the
       policy is an MLS type policy (MCS or MLS) and there is a color configu-
       ration file secolor.conf(5) (see the FILES section).

       The color_str string is a space separated list of eight hexadecimal RGB
       triples, each prefixed by a hash character  (#).  These  represent  the
       user:role:type:range  components  of the foreground and background col-
       ors. An example string is shown in the EXAMPLE section.

       The returned color_str string must be freed with free(3).

       If a color has not been configured for  a  specific  user,  role,  type
       and/or      range      component      of      context     raw,     then
       selinux_raw_context_to_color()  will  select  the  color  returned   in
       color_str in order of precedence as follows:
              role, type, range
              user, type, range
              user, role, range
              user, role, type

       If there are no entries in the secolor.conf(5) file for any of the com-
       ponents of context raw (or the file is not present), then  the  default
       string returned in color_str is:

              ----- user ---- ---- role ----  ---- type ----  ---- range ----
              #000000 #ffffff #000000 #ffffff #000000 #ffffff #000000 #ffffff

RETURN VALUE
       On success, zero is returned.
       On failure, -1 is returned with errno set appropriately.

ERRORS
       ENOENT If the mcstransd(8) daemon is not running.

FILES
       selinux_raw_context_to_color()  obtains  the  translated entry from the
       active    policy    secolor.conf(5)     file     as     returned     by
       selinux_colors_path(3).     The    file    format   is   described   in
       secolor.conf(5).

NOTES
       1. The primary use of selinux_raw_context_to_color()  is  to  return  a
       color  that  corresponds to a range, that can then be used to highlight
       information at different MLS levels.

       2. The mcstransd(8) daemon process security level must dominate the raw
       security level passed to it by the selinux_raw_context_to_color() func-
       tion. If not, the range color selected will be as defined by the  order
       of precedence.

EXAMPLE
       selinux_raw_context_to_color()  returns  the  foreground and background
       colors of the context string components (user:role:type:range)  as  RGB
       triples as follows:

             user     :       role      :      type      :      range
         fg       bg  :   fg       bg   :  fg       bg   :  fg       bg
       #000000 #ffffff  #ffffff #000000  #d2b48c #ffa500  #000000 #008000
        black   white :  white   black  : tan    orange  : black   green
