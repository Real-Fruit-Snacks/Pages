NAME

rmf - remove an
nmh folder

SYNOPSIS

rmf

[-help] [-version]
[+folder] [-interactive |
-nointeractive] 

DESCRIPTION

rmf
removes all of the messages (files) within the specified (or
default) folder, and then removes the folder (directory)
itself.

If there are
any files within the folder which are not a part of
nmh, they will not be removed, and an error
will be produced. If the folder is given explicitly, or the
-nointeractive option is given, then the folder will
be removed without confirmation. Otherwise, the user will be
asked for confirmation. If rmf can’t, for some
reason, find the current folder the folder to be removed
defaults to ’+inbox’ (unless overridden by the
user’s profile entry “Inbox”), with
confirmation.

If the folder
being removed is a subfolder, the parent folder will become
the new current folder, and rmf will produce a
message telling the user this has happened. This provides an
easy mechanism for selecting a set of messages, operating on
the list, then removing the list and returning to the
current folder, from which the list was extracted.

If rmf
is used on a read-only folder, it will delete all the
private sequences (i.e., .RI “atr- seq - folder
” entries) for this folder from your context without
affecting the folder itself.

rmf
irreversibly deletes messages that don’t have other
links, so use it with caution.

FILES

$HOME/.mh_profile
The user profile

PROFILE COMPONENTS

Path: To
determine the user’s nmh directory 
Current-Folder: To find the default current folder 
Inbox: To find the default inbox

SEE ALSO

folder(1),
rmm(1)

DEFAULTS

’+folder’
defaults to the current folder, usually with confirmation

’-interactive’ if +folder’ not
given, ’-nointeractive’ otherwise

CONTEXT

rmf will
set the current folder to the parent folder if a subfolder
is removed; or if the current folder is removed, it will
make “inbox” current. Otherwise, it
doesn’t change the current folder or message.

BUGS

Although
intuitively one would suspect that rmf works
recursively, it does not. Hence, if you have a sub-folder
within a folder, in order to rmf the parent, you must
first rmf each of the children.
