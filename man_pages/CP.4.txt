CP(4) BSD/i386 Kernel Interfaces Manual CP(4)

NAME

cp â€” driver for
synchronous Cronyx Tau-PCI WAN adapters

SYNOPSIS

To compile this driver into the
kernel, place the following line in your kernel
configuration file:

device
cp

Alternatively,
to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following line in loader.conf(5):

if_cp_load="YES"

Additional
options:

device sppp 
options NETGRAPH 
options NETGRAPH_CRONYX

DESCRIPTION

The cp driver needs
either sppp(4) or netgraph(4). Which one to use is
determined by the NETGRAPH_CRONYX option. If this option is
present in your kernel configuration file, the cp
driver will be compiled with netgraph(4) support. Otherwise,
it will be compiled with sppp(4) support.

Refer to
sconfig(8) for information about the cp adapter
configuration.
