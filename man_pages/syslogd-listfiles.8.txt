DESCRIPTION

Sysklogd
provides a modern mechanism to log system messages. This
mechanism is controlled by the file /etc/syslog.conf.
Messages are divided into logfiles which can grow quite big.
Therefore the logfiles need to be rotated once per day, per
week or per month. On a Debian GNU/Linux system most of the
files are rotated once per week.

This program
helps the rotation script to determine which logfiles need
to be rotated and when. It takes care of news logfiles that
are handled by the news.daily script from INN. In
conjunction with the scripts in /etc/cron.daily and
/etc/cron.weekly it takes care of files with
sensitive information.

By default a
list of files for daily rotation is generated. At the moment
this option only reflects entries that contain
"*.*" as facility.priority.

OPTIONS

&minus;a,
&minus;&minus;all

List all logfiles and ignore
all other rules.

&minus;f config
file

Specify an alternative
configuration file instead of /etc/syslog.conf, which
is the default.

&minus;s
pattern

Specify a regular expression
for files that must not be listed.

&minus;&minus;auth

Only list files containing sensitive information such as
the one containing auth.*.

&minus;&minus;large
nnn

Define the filesize for a large
file. The size is provided in bytes. This value defaults to
1 megabyte.

&minus;&minus;ignore&minus;size

Don&rsquo;t rotate files whose
file size is larger than the regular limit (see above). This
option is useful if you are postprocessing logfiles which
would break if log files are rotated at a different
date/time.

&minus;&minus;news

Don&rsquo;t exclude news logfiles which are normally
handled by the news.daily script from INN.

&minus;w,
&minus;&minus;weekly

Generate the list for weekly
rotation.
