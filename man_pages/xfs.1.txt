DESCRIPTION

xfs is
the X Window System font server. It supplies fonts to X
Window System display servers. The server is usually run by
a system administrator, and started via init(8).
Users may also wish to start private font servers for
specific sets of fonts.

To connect to a
font server, see the documentation for your X server; it
likely supports the syntax documented in the &ldquo;FONT
SERVER NAMES&rdquo; section of X(7).

OPTIONS

&minus;config
configuration_file

specifies the configuration
file xfs will use. If this parameter is not
specified, xfs will read its configuration from the default
file, /etc/X11/fs/config.

&minus;daemon

instructs xfs to fork
and go into the background automatically at startup. If this
option is not specified, xfs will run as a regular
process (unless it was built to daemonize by default). When
running as a daemon, xfs will attempt to create a
file in which it stores its process ID, and will delete that
file upon exit;

&minus;droppriv

instructs xfs to attempt
to run as user and group xfs (unless the
&minus;user option is used). This has been
implemented for security reasons, as xfs may have
undiscovered buffer overflows or other paths for possible
exploit, both local and remote. When using this option, you
may also wish to specify &rsquo;no&minus;listen = tcp&rsquo;
in the config file, which ensures that xfs will not
to use a TCP port at all. By default, xfs runs with
the user and group IDs of the user who invoked it.

&minus;ls
listen_socket

specifies a file descriptor
which is already set up to be used as the listen socket.
This option is only intended to be used by the font server
itself when automatically spawning another copy of itself to
handle additional connections.

&minus;nodaemon

instructs xfs not to
daemonize (fork and detach from its controlling terminal).
This option only has an effect if xfs is built to
daemonize by default, which is not the stock
configuration.

&minus;port
tcp_port

specifies the TCP port number
on which the server will listen for connections. The default
port number is 7100. This option is ignored if xfs is
configured to not listen to TCP transports at all (see
&ldquo;Configuration File Format&rdquo; below).

&minus;user
username

instructs xfs to run as
the user username. See &minus;droppriv for why
this may be desired. By default, xfs runs with the
user and group IDs of the user who invoked it.

INPUT FILES

xfs
reads and serves any font file format recognized by the X
server itself. It locates font files through the
specification of a catalogue, which is declared in
xfs&rsquo;s configuration file.

Configuration
File Format 
xfs reads its configuration from a text file (see the
&minus;config option in the &ldquo;OPTIONS&rdquo;
section above). The configuration language is a list of
keyword and value pairs. Each keyword is followed by an
equals sign (&rsquo;=&rsquo;) and then the desired
value.

Recognized
keywords include: 
alternate&minus;servers (list of strings)

lists alternate servers for
this font server. See the &ldquo;FONT SERVER NAMES&rdquo;
section of X(7) for the syntax of the string.

catalogue (list of
strings)

declares as ordered list of
font path element names from which fonts will be served. The
current implementation only supports a single catalogue
("all") containing all of the specified fonts. A
special directory with symlinks to font paths can be
specified using a catalogue: entry. See the
CATALOGUE DIR section below for details.

client&minus;limit
(cardinal)

determines the number of
clients this font server will support before refusing
service. This is useful for tuning the load on each
individual font server.

clone&minus;self
(boolean)

indicates whether this font
server should attempt to clone itself when the number of
connected clients reaches the client&minus;limit.

default&minus;point&minus;size
(cardinal)

The default pointsize (in
decipoints) for font requests that don&rsquo;t specify a
point size. The default is 120.

default&minus;resolutions
(list of resolutions)

indicates the resolutions the
server supports by default. This information may be used as
a hint for pre-rendering, and substituted into requests for
scaled fonts which do not specify a resolution. A
resolution is a comma-separated pair of horizontal
and vertical resolutions in pixels per inch. Multiple
resolutions are separated by commas.

deferglyphs
(string)

sets the mode for delayed
fetching and caching of glyphs. string should be one
of &rsquo;none&rsquo;, meaning glyphs deferment is disabled,
&rsquo;all&rsquo;, meaning it is enabled for all fonts, and
&rsquo;16&rsquo;, meaning it is enabled only for 16-bit
fonts.

error&minus;file
(string)

indicates the filename of the
error file. All warnings and errors will be logged here,
unless use&minus;syslog is set to a true value (see
below).

no&minus;listen
(trans-type)

disables the specified
transport type. For example, TCP/IP connections can be
disabled with &rsquo;no&minus;listen = tcp&rsquo;.

port
(cardinal)

indicates the TCP port on which
the server will listen for connections.

use&minus;syslog
(boolean)

determines whether errors and
diagnostics should be reported via syslog(3) (on
supported systems) instead of being written to the
error&minus;file (see above).

CATALOGUE DIR

You can specify
a special kind of font path in the form
catalogue:. The directory specified after
the catalogue: prefix will be scanned for symlinks and each
symlink destination will be added as a local fontfile
FPE.

The symlink can
be suffixed by attributes such as
&rsquo;unscaled&rsquo;, which will be passed through
to the underlying fontfile FPE. The only exception is the
newly introduced &rsquo;pri&rsquo; attribute, which
will be used for ordering the font paths specified by the
symlinks.

An example
configuration:

75dpi:unscaled:pri=20
&minus;> /usr/share/X11/fonts/75dpi 
ghostscript:pri=60 &minus;>
/usr/share/fonts/default/ghostscript 
misc:unscaled:pri=10 &minus;> /usr/share/X11/fonts/misc

type1:pri=40 &minus;> /usr/share/X11/fonts/Type1 
type1:pri=50 &minus;> /usr/share/fonts/default/Type1

This will add
/usr/share/X11/fonts/misc as the first FPE with the
attribute the attribute unscaled etc. This is functionally
equivalent to setting the following font path:

/usr/share/X11/fonts/misc:unscaled,

/usr/share/X11/fonts/75dpi:unscaled, 
/usr/share/X11/fonts/Type1, 
/usr/share/fonts/default/Type1, 
/usr/share/fonts/default/ghostscript

Example
Configuration File 
# 
# sample font server configuration file 
#

# allow a max
of 10 clients to connect to this font server. 
client&minus;limit = 10

# When a font
server reaches the above limit, start up a new one. 
clone&minus;self = on

# Identify
alternate font servers for clients to use. 
alternate&minus;servers = hansen:7101,hansen:7102

# Look for
fonts in the following directories. The first is a set of

# TrueType outlines, the second is a set of misc bitmaps
(such as terminal 
# and cursor fonts), and the last is a set of 100dpi
bitmaps. 
# 
catalogue = /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/TTF, 
/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc, 
/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi/

# in 12 points,
decipoints 
default&minus;point&minus;size = 120

# 100 x 100 and
75 x 75 
default&minus;resolutions = 100,100,75,75

# Specify our
log filename. 
error&minus;file = /var/log/xfs.log

# Direct
diagnostics to our own log file instead of using syslog.

use&minus;syslog = off

OUTPUT FILES

When operating
in daemon mode, xfs sends diagnostic messages (errors
and warnings) to the system log via the syslog C
library function by default. However, these messages can be
sent to an alternate location via the
error&minus;file and use&minus;syslog
configuration variables; see &ldquo;Configuration File
Format&rdquo;, above.

ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS

xfs
handles the following signals specially: 
SIGTERM

causes the font server to exit
cleanly.

SIGUSR1

causes xfs to re-read
its configuration file.

SIGUSR2

causes xfs to flush any
cached data it may have.

SIGHUP

causes xfs to reset, closing all active
connections and re-reading the configuration file.

BUGS

Multiple
catalogues should be supported.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS

Significant
further development of xfs is unlikely. One of the
original motivations behind it was the single-threaded
nature of the X server &mdash; a user&rsquo;s X session
could seem to &rsquo;freeze up&rsquo; while the X server
took a moment to rasterize a font. This problem with the X
server, which remains single-threaded in all popular
implementations to this day, has been mitigated on two
fronts: machines have gotten much faster, and client-side
font rendering (particularly via the Xft library) is the
norm in contemporary software.
