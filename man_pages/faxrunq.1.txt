NAME

faxrunq - send
fax jobs queued by faxspool(1)

SYNOPSIS

faxrunq

DESCRIPTION

Run the fax
queue set up by faxspool(1), try to send all faxes, record
result, remove job and send notify mails.

faxrunq
looks for all the jobs queued by faxspool(1) to
/var/spool/fax/outgoing/*. For each job in the queue,
faxrunq tries to send it, using sendfax(8).

If the send
succeeds, the job is removed from the queue, and a
"success" mail is sent to the originator of the
spooled job.

If the send
fails, it’s logged, and faxrunq proceeds to the next
job. If the job fails five times "fatally", that
is, not with a locked or engaged line, but with "NO
CARRIER" (no fax machine, or line noise), the job is
suspended, and the requestor gets a mail, telling him
so.

faxrunq
can be run from the command line (but make sure the user
doing this has write access to the modem device and to the
fax queue, that is, usually this should be done by
"uucp" or "root"). In a production
environment, it’s more useful to start faxrunq
from cron(8) in regular intervals, like "run it
every 5 minutes". See the cron(8) and/or
crontab(1) man pages for this (which man page exists
depends on your system).

OPTIONS

-q

Tells faxrunq to be
quiet, that is, suppress all status messages. Error messages
will still be printed.

FILES

/var/spool/fax/outgoing/stop

if this file exists,
faxrunq (and faxrunqd) will do nothing. You can use
this to stop queue processing while testing something, or if
you know that the modem(s) are unavailable and do not want
to run into oany error messages, etc.

/var/spool/fax/outgoing/faxqueue_done

Every time faxrunq (or
faxrunqd) run the fax queue, a time stamp is written into
that file. It is used by faxspool to display a
warning if the queue hasn’t been run recently (so
faxes may get stuck).

CONFIGURATION FILE

Some aspects of
the behaviour of faxrunq can be controlled by a
configuration file, /etc/mgetty/faxrunq.config. In this
file, you can use the following options: 
success-send-mail [y/n]

A boolean parameter that
controls whether a mail will be sent after successful
completition of the fax job.

failure-send-mail
[y/n]

A boolean parameter that
controls whether a mail will be sent after the fax job has
failed more than the maximum number of times.

success-call-program

Here, you can specify a program
that will be run when the fax has been successfully sent. It
will be passed two command line parameters. The first is the
full path to the fax JOB file (see faxq(5)), the second is
the last exit code from sendfax (for
success-call-program, this is always "0").

failure-call-program

Similar to the
"success-call-program", this program will be run
when the fax has been failed too often and faxrunq
gives up. This script could, for example, print out the fax
on a printer so that it can be sent manually on a paper fax
machine.

maxfail-costly

This specifies the number of
times that a fax may fail "fatally", that is,
causing telephone costs (explained above). The default value
is 5.

maxfail-total

This is the absolute maximum
number of times that faxrunq will try to send any
given fax. The default value is 10. (Right now, it’s
not yet implemented).

delete-sent-jobs
[y/n]

Determines whether
faxrunq should delete jobs after sending, or leave
them in the fax queue (while moving the "JOB" file
to "JOB.done") so that they can be seen at by
"faxq -o". The default value is "do not
delete sent faxes".

acct-log

Specifies where faxrunq
should protocol success and failure of each try to send a
fax job. The default location is
/var/spool/fax/outgoing/acct.log.

There are some
other options that are allowed, but ignored. These are:
max-modems, and faxrunqd-log.

They are used
by faxrunqd(8) (which reads the same config file, but has
more options).

BUGS

faxrunq
doesn’t handle proper time scheduling yet

Don’t use
faxrunq if you have malevolent users with access to
the fax spool. It doesn’t handle all cases of file
movement tricks correctly. Use faxrunqd(8) instead,
which does it correctly (this point is mostly moot if the
fax queue is set up correctly - that is, owned by
’uucp’, mode 755, and faxrunq(1) is also run as
user ’uucp’).
