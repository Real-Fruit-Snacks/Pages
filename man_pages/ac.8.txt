AC(8) BSD System Manager’s Manual AC(8)

NAME

ac — display
connect time accounting

SYNOPSIS

ac [−d]
[−p] [−w file]
[users ...]

DESCRIPTION

If the file /var/log/wtmp
exists, a record of individual login and logout times are
written to it by init(8) and login(8) respectively. The
program ac examines these records and writes the
accumulated connect time for all logins to the standard
output.

Options
available:

−d

Display the
connect times in 24 hour chunks.

−p

Display
individual user totals.

−w file

Read raw connect time data from
file instead of the default file
/var/log/wtmp.

users ...

Display totals for the given
individuals only.

If no arguments
are given, ac displays the total amount of login time
for all active accounts on the system.

The default
wtmp file is an infinitely increasing file unless
frequently truncated. This is normally done by the daily
daemon scripts scheduled by cron(8) which rename and rotate
the wtmp files before truncating them (and keeping
about a weeks worth on hand). No login times are collected
however, if the file does not exist.

FILES 
/var/log/wtmp 
/var/log/wtmp.[0-7]

files
