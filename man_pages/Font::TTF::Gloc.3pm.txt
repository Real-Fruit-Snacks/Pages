NAME
       Font::TTF::Gloc - Offsets into Glat table for the start of the
       attributes for each glyph

DESCRIPTION
       The Gloc table is a bit like the Loca table only for Graphite glyph
       attributes. The table has the following elements:

       Version
           Table format version

       numAttrib
           Maximum number of attributes associated with a glyph.

       locations
           An array of offsets into the Glat table for the start of each glyph

       names
           If defined, an array of name table name ids indexed by attribute
           number.

   $t->minsize()
       Returns the minimum size this table can be. If it is smaller than this,
       then the table must be bad and should be deleted or whatever.
