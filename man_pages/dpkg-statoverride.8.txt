NAME

dpkg&minus;statoverride
&minus; override ownership and mode of files

SYNOPSIS

dpkg&minus;statoverride
[options] command

DESCRIPTION

&rsquo;stat
overrides&rsquo; are a way to tell dpkg(1) to use
a different owner or mode for a file when a package is
installed. (note: I use the word &rsquo;file&rsquo; here,
but in reality this can be any filesystem object that dpkg
handles, including directories, devices, etc.). This can be
used to force programs that are normally setuid to be
install without a setuid flag, or only executable by a
certain group.

dpkg&minus;statoverride
is a utility to manage the list of stat overrides. It has
three basic functions: adding, removing and listing
overrides.

COMMANDS

&minus;&minus;add
user group mode file

Add an override for
file. file does not need to exist when this
command is used; the override will be stored and used later.
Users and groups can be specified by their name (for example
root or nobody), or by their number by
prepending the number with a &rsquo;#&rsquo; (for
example #0 or #65534). The mode needs
to be specified in octal.

If
&minus;&minus;update is specified and file exists, it
is immediately set to the new owner and mode.

&minus;&minus;remove
file

Remove an override for
file, the status of file is left unchanged by
this command.

&minus;&minus;list
[glob-pattern]

List all overrides. If a glob
pattern is specified restrict the output to overrides which
match the glob. If there are no overrides or none match the
glob dpkg&minus;statoverride will exit with an
exitcode of 1.

&minus;&minus;help

Show the usage message and exit.

&minus;&minus;version

Show the version and exit.

OPTIONS

&minus;&minus;admindir
directory

Change the directory of
the dpkg database where the statoverride file is also
stored. Defaults to /var/lib/dpkg.

&minus;&minus;force

Force an action, even if a
sanity check would otherwise prohibit it. This is necessary
to override an existing override.

&minus;&minus;update

Immediately try to change the
file to the new owner and mode if it exists.

&minus;&minus;quiet

Be less verbose about what we
do.

FILES

/var/lib/dpkg/statoverride

File which contains the current
list of stat overrides of the system. It is located in the
dpkg administration directory, along with other files
important to dpkg, such as &rsquo;status&rsquo; or
&rsquo;available&rsquo;. 
Note: dpkg&minus;statoverride preserves the old copy
of this file, with extension "&minus;old", before
replacing it with the new one.
