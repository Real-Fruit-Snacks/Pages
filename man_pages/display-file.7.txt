NAME

display-file
: Render display into image file

SYNOPSIS

display-file:
[-flushcmd=] [-flushframe=] 
[-flushtime=] 

DESCRIPTION

Renders an
image into a file. The file can be a framebuffer device
(e.g. /dev/fb0), in which case a reasonable
representation of the image will be drawn on the console
so long as the program&rsquo;s mode matches the
framebuffer&rsquo;s mode.

Note: This target
generates no input. The display-multi target can be
used in order to see (and control) what the program does
(using a normal target) and then generate a snapshot when
the program exits.

OPTIONS

filename
is the file to render the images to. If the filename is a
PPM file (has the extension .ppm), then the image
will be generated at ggiClose time. Otherwise the
file is a custom GGIFILE format and is generated
continuously.

The
display-file target can be used to generate movies
from running LibGGI applications. To do this, set
-flushcmd to a shell command to execute at the times
given by one of the two other parameters. This looks
typically like:

ppmtogif
foo.ppm > foo.%04d.gif

The command is
passed through a printf(3) which has the current
count of saved frames as an argument (or rather as 10
arguments to allow a few more complex commands).

This shell
command is either executed at every n-th invocation
of ggiFlush or every t seconds, where t can
have fractional components (specified as decimal).

Note, that the
invocation of the shell command will slow down the program,
so make sure you use a reasonable value, if you use the
-flushtime argument.

The primary
file is updated before every invocation of the shell
command.
