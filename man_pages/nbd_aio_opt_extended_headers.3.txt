NAME

nbd_aio_opt_extended_headers
- request the server to enable extended headers

SYNOPSIS

#include

typedef struct { 
int (*callback) (void *user_data, int *error); 
void *user_data; 
void (*free) (void *user_data); 
} nbd_completion_callback; 
int nbd_aio_opt_extended_headers ( 
struct nbd_handle *h, 
nbd_completion_callback completion_callback 
);

DESCRIPTION

Request that
the server use extended headers, by sending
"NBD_OPT_EXTENDED_HEADERS". This behaves like the
synchronous counterpart nbd_opt_extended_headers(3),
except that it does not wait for the server’s
response.

To determine
when the request completes, wait for
nbd_aio_is_connecting(3) to return false. Or supply
the optional "completion_callback" which will be
invoked as described in "Completion callbacks" in
libnbd(3), except that it is automatically retired
regardless of return value. Note that detecting whether the
server returns an error (as is done by the return value of
the synchronous counterpart) is only possible with a
completion callback.

RETURN VALUE

If the call is
successful the function returns 0.

ERRORS

On error -1 is
returned.

Refer to
"ERROR HANDLING" in libnbd(3) for how to
get further details of the error.

The following
parameters must not be NULL: "h". For more
information see "Non-NULL parameters" in
libnbd(3).

HANDLE STATE

nbd_aio_opt_extended_headers
can be called when the handle is in the following state:

┌─────────────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────┐

│ Handle created, before connecting │ ❌
error │ 
│ Connecting │ ❌ error │ 
│ Connecting & handshaking (opt_mode) │
✅ allowed │ 
│ Connected to the server │ ❌ error
│ 
│ Connection shut down │ ❌ error │

│ Handle dead │ ❌ error │ 

└─────────────────────────────────────┴─────────────────────────┘
