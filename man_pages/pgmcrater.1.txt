NAME
       pgmcrater - create cratered terrain by fractal forgery

SYNOPSIS
       pgmcrater

       [-number n]

       [-height|-ysize s]

       [-width|-xsize s]

       [-gamma g]

       [-randomseed=integer]

       All  options  can  be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.  You
       may use two hyphens instead of one to designate an option.  You may use
       either  white  space  or  equals  signs  between an option name and its
       value.

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       pgmcrater is obsolete.  All it does now is invoke pamcrater,  pamshade‐
       drelief, and pamtopnm.  You should use those programs in any new appli‐
       cation, or if you are modifying an old program or process that does not
       have  to  work  with a version of Netpbm before 10.68 (September 2014).
       pgmcrater exists only for backward compatibility.

       The combination of the three programs mentioned above performs the same
       function as traditional pgmcrater.

       pgmcrater's  -number,  -height,  -width,  and  -randomseed  options are
       equivalent to the options of the same name on pamcrater.

       pgmcrater's -gamma option is equivalent to the option of the same  name
       on pamshadedrelief.

       pgmcrater's  -ysize option is identical to -height; -xsize is identical
       to -width.

       Note: The former pgmcrater code was split into pamcrater and  pamshade‐
       drelief.   The reason for the split is that having separate programs is
       more consistent with Netpbm's building block philosophy.  It is  possi‐
       ble the separate components can be used in other applications.
