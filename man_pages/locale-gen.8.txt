LOCALE-GEN(8)             BSD System Manager's Manual            LOCALE-GEN(8)

NAME
     locale-gen — generate localisation files from templates

SYNOPSIS
     locale-gen [--keep-existing]

DESCRIPTION
     As compiled locales are large, only templates are distributed in the de‐
     fault locales package, and only the desired locales are compiled on the
     target system.

     After selecting the locales into /etc/locale.gen (via dpkg package
     configuration, for example), locale-gen is run to compile them via
     localedef(1).

OPTIONS
     --keep-existing  Do not remove /usr/lib/locale/locale-archive, only com‐
                      piling new locales.

FILES

                      list of locales to build with # start-of-line comments.
