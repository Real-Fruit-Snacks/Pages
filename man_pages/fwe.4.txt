FWE(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual FWE(4)

NAME

fwe â€” Ethernet
emulation driver for FireWire

SYNOPSIS

To compile this driver into the
kernel, place the following lines in your kernel
configuration file:

device
firewire 
device fwe

Alternatively,
to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following line in loader.conf(5):

if_fwe_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION

The fwe driver provides
non-standard Ethernet emulation over FireWire (IEEE
1394).

firewire(4) and
fwohci(4) must be configured in the kernel as well.

This driver
exploits asynchronous stream over IEEE 1394 to carry
Ethernet frames. The stream channel can be specified by the
hw.firewire.fwe.stream_ch sysctl(8).

This driver
supports polling(4) as well if it is compiled with the
DEVICE_POLLING option.

HISTORY

The fwe device driver
first appeared in FreeBSD 5.0.

AUTHORS

The fwe driver and this
manual page were written by Hidetoshi Shimokawa.

BUGS

This driver emulates Ethernet in
a very adhoc way and it does not reserve a stream channel
using an isochronous manager. Note that this driver uses a
protocol which is very different from RFC 2734 (IPv4 over
IEEE 1394).
