nbdkit-xz-filter
- nbdkit xz filter

SYNOPSIS

nbdkit
--filter=xz file FILENAME.xz

nbdkit
--filter=xz curl https://example.com/FILENAME.xz

DESCRIPTION

"nbdkit-xz-filter"
is a filter for nbdkit(1) which uncompresses the
underlying plugin on the fly. The filter only supports
read-only connections.

Getting best
random access performance from xz 
xz(1) files are split into streams and blocks. Most xz
files contain only one stream which contains one or more
blocks. You can find out how many streams and blocks are in
an xz file by doing:

$ xz --list
winxp.img.xz 
Strms Blocks Compressed Uncompressed Ratio Check Filename

1 1 2,100.0 MiB 6,144.0 MiB 0.342 CRC64 winxp.img.xz 
&uarr;&uarr;&uarr; &uarr;&uarr;&uarr; 
streams blocks

xz files are
seekable on block boundaries only. Seeking is done by
seeking directly to the lower block boundary, then
uncompressing data until the precise byte is reached. As
uncompressing xz data is slow, to get best random access
performance, you must prepare your xz files with many small
blocks.

Use the
--block-size option with a small-ish block size. For
example this is the same image compressed with a 16 MB block
size:

$ xz --best
--block-size=16777216 winxp.img 

&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;

$ xz --list winxp.img.xz 
Strms Blocks Compressed Uncompressed Ratio Check Filename

1 384 2,120.1 MiB 6,144.0 MiB 0.345 CRC64 winxp.img.xz 
&uarr;&uarr;&uarr; 
blocks

This file can
be accessed randomly. At most 16 MB will have to be
uncompressed to seek to any byte.

As you would
expect, xz cannot compress as efficiently when using a
smaller block size. The space penalty in the above example
is 

PARAMETERS

xz-max-block=SIZE

The maximum block size that the
filter will read. The filter will refuse to read xz files
that contain any block larger than this size.

See the
discussion above about creating xz files with small block
sizes in order to reduce memory usage and increase
performance.

This parameter
is optional. If not specified it defaults to 512M.

xz-max-depth=N

Maximum number of blocks stored
in the LRU block cache.

This parameter
is optional. If not specified it defaults to 8.

The filter may
allocate up to
maximum block size in file &times; maxdepth
bytes of memory per connection.

FILES

$filterdir/nbdkit-xz-filter.so

The filter.

Use
"nbdkit --dump-config" to find the location of
$filterdir.
