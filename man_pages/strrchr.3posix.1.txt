STRRCHR(3POSIX)            POSIX Programmer's Manual           STRRCHR(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       strrchr — string scanning operation

SYNOPSIS
       #include <string.h>

       char *strrchr(const char *s, int c);

DESCRIPTION
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with  the
       ISO C  standard.  Any  conflict between the requirements described here
       and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017
       defers to the ISO C standard.

       The strrchr() function shall locate the last occurrence of c (converted
       to a char) in the string pointed to by s.  The terminating NUL  charac‐
       ter is considered to be part of the string.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon  successful  completion,  strrchr()  shall return a pointer to the
       byte or a null pointer if c does not occur in the string.

ERRORS
       No errors are defined.

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
   Finding the Base Name of a File
       The following example uses strrchr() to get a pointer to the base  name
       of  a  file. The strrchr() function searches backwards through the name
       of the file to find the last '/' character in name.  This pointer (plus
       one) will point to the base name of the file.

           #include <string.h>
           ...
           const char *name;
           char *basename;
           ...
           basename = strrchr(name, '/') + 1;
           ...

APPLICATION USAGE
       None.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
