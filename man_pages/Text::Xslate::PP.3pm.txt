NAME
       Text::Xslate::PP - Yet another Text::Xslate runtime in pure Perl

VERSION
       This document describes Text::Xslate::PP version v3.5.9.

DESCRIPTION
       This module implements a Text::Xslate runtime engine in pure Perl.
       Normally it will be loaded if it fails to load XS. So you do not need
       to use this module explicitly.

           # Text::Xslate loads PP if needed
           use Text::Xslate;
           my $tx = Text::Xslate->new();

       If you want to use Text::Xslate::PP, however, you can use it.

           use Text::Xslate::PP;
           my $tx = Text::Xslate->new();

       XS/PP mode might be switched with "$ENV{XSLATE} = 'pp' or 'xs'".

       $ENV{XSLATE} = 'pp=verbose' } may be useful for debugging.
