NAME
       pnmarith - replaced by pamarith

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       Starting  with  Netpbm 10.3, pnmarith is obsolete.  Use pamarith(1) in‚Äê
       stead.

       pamarith is backward compatible with pnmarith except where  your  input
       images  have different depths.  pnmarith would convert the one with the
       lesser depth to have the higher  depth  before  doing  the  arithmetic.
       With pamarith, you must do that step separately, using pgmtoppm.
