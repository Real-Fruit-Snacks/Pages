NAME

pnmarith -
replaced by pamarith

DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

Starting with
Netpbm 10.3, pnmarith is obsolete. Use
pamarith(1) instead.

pamarith
is backward compatible with pnmarith except where
your input images have different depths. pnmarith
would convert the one with the lesser depth to have the
higher depth before doing the arithmetic. With
pamarith, you must do that step separately, using
pgmtoppm.
