NAME

sane-avision -
SANE backend for original Avision and Avision OEM scanners
(HP, Minolta, Mitsubishi, UMAX and possibly more) flatbed
and film scanners.

ABOUT THIS FILE

This file is a
short description for the avision-backend shipped with
SANE.

DESCRIPTION

The
sane-avision library implements a SANE (Scanner
Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to various
Avision scanners and the Avision OEM scanners labelled by
HP, Minolta, Mitsubishi or Fujitsu.

It is fully
big-endian aware and in every-day use on PowerPC and SPARC
systems.

I suggest
you hold one hand on the power-button of the scanner
while you try the first scans - especially with
film-scanners!

CONFIGURATION

The
configuration file for this backend resides in
/etc/sane.d/avision.conf.

Its contents is
a list of device names that correspond to Avision and
Avision compatible scanners and backend-options. Empty lines
and lines starting with a hash mark (#) are ignored. A
sample configuration file is shown below:

# this is a
comment 
option force-a4 
option force-a3 
option skip-adf 
option disable-gamma-table 
option disable-calibration 
#scsi Vendor Model Type Bus Channel ID LUN 
scsi AVISION 
scsi HP 
scsi /dev/scanner 
usb 0x03f0 0x0701 
force-a4:

Forces the backend to overwrite
the scanable area returned by the scanner to ISO A4. Scanner
that are known to return bogus data are marked in the
backend so if you need this option please report this to the
backend maintainer. USE WITH CARE!

force-a3:

Forces the backend to overwrite
the scanable area returned by the scanner to ISO A3. Scanner
that are known to return bogus data are marked in the
backend so if you need this option please report this to the
backend maintainer. USE WITH CARE!

skip-adf:

Forces the backend to ignore an
inconsistent ADF status returned by the scanner (ADF not
present, but ADF model number non-zero). Without this
option, the backend will make several attempts to reset the
ADF and retry the query in this situation, and will fail
with a "not supported" error if the ADF still
doesn&rsquo;t respond.

disable-gamma-table:

Disables the usage of the
scanner&rsquo;s gamma-table. You might try this if your
scans hang or only produces random garbage.

disable-calibration:

Disables the scanner&rsquo;s
color calibration. You might try this if your scans hang or
only produces random garbage.

Note:

Any option above modifies the default code-flow for your
scanner. The options should only be used when you encounter
problems with the default be- haviour of the backend. Please
report the need of options to the backend-author so the
backend can be fixed as soon as possible.

DEVICE NAMES

This backend
expects device names of the form:

scsi
scsi-spec

usb
usb-spec

Where
scsi-spec is the path-name to a special device or a
device ID for the device that corresponds to a SCSI scanner.
The special device name must be a generic SCSI device or a
symlink to such a device, for example on Linux
"/dev/sga" or "/dev/sg0". The device ID
is the ID returned by the scanner, for example
"HP" or "AVISION". See sane-scsi(5) for
details.

Note:

Since the backend now includes
native USB access, it is no longer needed - even considered
obsolete - to access USB scanner via the SCSI emulation
(named hpusbscsi on Linux) for Avision USB devices such as
the HP 53xx, HP 74xx or Minolta film-scanners.

usb-spec
is the USB device name, the vendor/product ID pair or the
name used by libusb corresponding to the USB scanner. For
example "0x03f0 0x0701" or
"libusb:002:003". See sane-usb(5) for details.

The program
sane-find-scanner helps to find out the correct scsi
or usb device name.

A list with
supported devices is built into the avision backend so
normally specifying an ID should not be necessary.

FILES

/etc/sane.d/avision.conf

The backend configuration file
(see also description of SANE_CONFIG_DIR below).

/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-avision.a

The static library implementing
this backend.

/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-avision.so

The shared library implementing
this backend (present on systems that support dynamic
loading).

ENVIRONMENT

SANE_CONFIG_DIR

This environment variable
specifies the list of directories that may contain the
configuration file. Under UNIX, the directories are
separated by a colon (&rsquo;:&rsquo;), under OS/2, they are
separated by a semi-colon (&rsquo;;&rsquo;). If this
variable is not set, the configuration file is searched in
two default directories: first, the current working
directory (".") and then in /etc/sane.d. If the
value of the environment variable ends with the directory
separator character, then the default directories are
searched after the explicitly specified directories. For
example, setting SANE_CONFIG_DIR to
"/tmp/config:" would result in directories
"tmp/config", ".", and
"/etc/sane.d" being searched (in this order).

SANE_DEBUG_AVISION

If the library was compiled
with debug support enabled, this environment variable
controls the debug level for this backend. Higher debug
levels increase the verbosity of the output. The debug level
7 is the author&rsquo;s preferred value to debug backend
problems.

Example: export
SANE_DEBUG_AVISION=7
