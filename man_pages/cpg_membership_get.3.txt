DESCRIPTION

The
cpg_membership_get function is used to determine the
current processes in the configuration. You probably will
not need to call this function much as one of the first
confchg callbacks you will get will be from the cpg_join()
function containing your process. The argument handle
is used to reference the cpg instantiation. The argument
groupName will return the name of the group The
argument member_list will return the list of
processors in the current membership. The argument
member_list_entries should be set with the size of
member_list and will return the size of the member_list
after return from the function.

ERRORS

The errors are
undocumented.
