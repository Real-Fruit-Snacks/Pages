NAME

syslogd &minus;
log system messages

SYNOPSIS

/usr/sbin/syslogd
[-d] [-f configfile]
[-m markinterval]
[-p path] [-t | -T]

DESCRIPTION

syslogd
reads and forwards system messages to the appropriate log
files or users, depending upon the priority of a message and
the system facility from which it originates. The
configuration file /etc/syslog.conf (see
syslog.conf(4)) controls where messages are
forwarded. syslogd logs a mark (timestamp) message
every markinterval minutes (default 20) at
priority LOG_INFO to the facility whose name is given
as mark in the syslog.conf file.

A system
message consists of a single line of text, which may be
prefixed with a priority code number enclosed in
angle-brackets (<>); priorities are defined in
.

syslogd
reads from the STREAMS log driver, /dev/log,
and from any transport provider specified in
/etc/netconfig, /etc/net/transport/hosts, and
/etc/net/transport/services.

syslogd
reads the configuration file when it starts up, and again
whenever it receives a HUP signal (see
signal(3HEAD), at which time it also closes all files
it has open, re-reads its configuration file, and then opens
only the log files that are listed in that file.
syslogd exits when it receives a TERM
signal.

As it starts
up, syslogd creates the file /etc/syslog.pid,
if possible, containing its process identifier
(PID).

If message
ID generation is enabled (see log(7D)), each
message will be preceded by an identifier in the following
format: [ID msgid
facility.priority]. msgid is
the message&rsquo;s numeric identifier described in
msgid(1M). facility and priority are
described in syslog.conf(4). [ID 123456
kern.notice] is an example of an identifier when message
ID generation is enabled.

If the message
originated in a loadable kernel module or driver, the kernel
module&rsquo;s name (for example, ufs) will be
displayed instead of unix. See EXAMPLES for
sample output from syslogd with and without message
ID generation enabled.

In an effort to
reduce visual clutter, message IDs are not displayed
when writing to the console; message IDs are only
written to the log file. See EXAMPLES.

The
/etc/default/syslogd file contains the following
default parameter settings. See FILES. 
LOG_FROM_REMOTE

Specifies whether remote
messages are logged. LOG_FROM_REMOTE=NO is equivalent
to the -t command-line option. The default value for
LOG_FROM_REMOTE is YES.

OPTIONS

The following
options are supported:

-d

Turn on debugging. This option should only be used
interactively in a root shell once the system is in
multi-user mode. It should not be used in the system
start-up scripts, as this will cause the system to hang at
the point where syslogd is started.

-f configfile

Specify an alternate
configuration file.

-m
markinterval

Specify an interval, in
minutes, between mark messages.

-p path

Specify an alternative log
device name. The default is /dev/log.

-T

Enable the syslogd UDP port to turn on logging of
remote messages. This is the default behavior. See
FILES. 

-t

Disable the syslogd UDP port to turn off logging
of remote messages. See FILES.

EXAMPLES

Example 1:
syslogd Output Without Message ID Generation Enabled

The following
example shows the output from syslogd when message
ID generation is not enabled:

Sep 29 21:41:18 cathy unix: alloc /: file system full

Example 2:
syslogd Output with ID generation Enabled

The following
example shows the output from syslogd when message
ID generation is enabled. The message
ID is displayed when writing to log
file/var/adm/messages.

Sep 29 21:41:18 cathy ufs: [ID 845546 kern.notice]
                                    alloc /: file system full

Example 3:
syslogd Output with ID Generation Enabled

The following
example shows the output from syslogd when message
ID generation is enabled when writing to the
console. Even though message ID is enabled, the message
ID is not displayed at the console.

Sep 29 21:41:18 cathy ufs: alloc /: file system full

NOTES

The mark
message is a system time stamp, and so it is only defined
for the system on which syslogd is running. It can
not be forwarded to other systems.

When
syslogd receives a HUP signal, it attempts to close
all log files to which it is currently logging messages. If,
for some reason, one of these files does not close within a
generous grace period, syslogd shuts down, logging an
error message to the console. If the console is one of the
files that did not successfully close, syslogd
instead sends a mail message to the superuser on the current
system stating that it shut down, and that the console was
not responding.

Care should be
taken to ensure that each window displaying messages
forwarded by syslogd (especially console windows) is
run in the system default locale (which is
syslogd&rsquo;s locale). If this advice is not
followed, it is possible for a syslog message to
alter the terminal settings for that window, possibly even
allowing remote execution of arbitrary commands from that
window.
