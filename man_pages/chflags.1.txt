CHFLAGS(1) BSD General Commands Manual CHFLAGS(1)

NAME

chflags &mdash; change
file flags

SYNOPSIS

chflags [

&minus;R
[&minus;H | &minus;L | &minus;P]
] flags file ...

DESCRIPTION

The chflags utility
modifies the file flags of the listed files as specified by
the flags operand.

The options are
as follows:

&minus;H

If the
&minus;R option is specified, symbolic links on the
command line are followed. (Symbolic links encountered in
the tree traversal are not followed.)

&minus;L

If the
&minus;R option is specified, all symbolic links are
followed.

&minus;P

If the
&minus;R option is specified, no symbolic links are
followed. This is the default.

&minus;R

Change the file
flags for the file hierarchies rooted in the files instead
of just the files themselves.

The flags are
specified as an octal number or a comma separated list of
keywords. The following keywords are currently defined:

arch

set the
archived flag (super-user only)

opaque

set the opaque
flag (owner or super-user only)

nodump

set the nodump
flag (owner or super-user only)

sappnd

set the system
append-only flag (super-user only)

schg

set the system
immutable flag (super-user only)

sunlnk

set the system
undeletable flag (super-user only)

uappnd

set the user
append-only flag (owner or super-user only)

uchg

set the user
immutable flag (owner or super-user only)

uunlnk

set the user
undeletable flag (owner or super-user only)

archived, sappend, schange, 
simmutable, uappend, uchange,
uimmutable, sunlink, uunlink

aliases for the above

Putting the
letters &rsquo;&rsquo;no&rsquo;&rsquo; before an
option causes the flag to be turned off. For example:

nouchg

the immutable
bit should be cleared

Symbolic links
do not have flags, so unless the &minus;H or
&minus;L option is set, chflags on a symbolic
link always succeeds and has no effect. The &minus;H,
&minus;L and &minus;P options are ignored
unless the &minus;R option is specified. In addition,
these options override each other and the command&rsquo;s
actions are determined by the last one specified.

You can use
"ls -lo" to see the flags of existing files.

DIAGNOSTICS

The chflags utility
exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error
occurs.
