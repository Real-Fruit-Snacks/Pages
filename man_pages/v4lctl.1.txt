v4lctl sets the parameters directly.

OPTIONS

xawtv-remote
knows the following options:

-d dpy

-i id

v4lctl
understands these options:

-h

print a short help text

-c device

Set video4linux device.

-D driver

Set video4linux driver.

-v n

Set debug level to n, where n = [0..2]

COMMANDS

Both tools
basically use the same set of commands. Some of them are
useful for xawtv-remote only (fullscreen for example).

setstation [  |  | next | prev | back
]

Set the TV station. This
selects on of the TV stations which are configured in the
.xawtv config file. The argument can be the station name or
a number (the first one listed in the config file is 0,
...). next/prev jumps to the next/previous station in the
list, back to the previously selected one.

setchannel [  |
next | prev ]

Tune in some channel.

setfreqtab

Set the frequency table. See
the menu in xawtv for a list of valid choices.

setnorm 

Set the TV norm
(NTSC/PAL/SECAM).

setinput [  |
next ]

Set the video input
(Television/Composite1/...)

capture [ on | off | overlay
| grabdisplay ]

Set capture mode.

volume mute on | off

mute / unmute audio.

volume  
color  
hue  
bright  
contrast 

Set the parameter to the
specified value.  can be one of the following: A
percent value ("70%" for example). Some absolute
value ("32768"), the valid range is hardware
specific. Relative values can be specified too by prefixing
with "+=" or "-=" ("+=10%" or
"-=2000"). The keywords "inc" and
"dec" are accepted to and will increase and
decrease the given value in small steps.

setattr 

Set set the value of some
attribute (color, contrast, ... can be set this way
too).

show [ 
]

Show the value current of some
attribute.

list

List all available attributes with all properties
(default value, range, ...)

snap [ jpeg | ppm ] [ full |
win | widthxheight ] 

Capture one image.

webcam

Capture one image. Does
basically the same as "snap jpeg win
". Works also while avi recording is
active. It writes to a temporary file and renames it when
done, so there is never a invalid file.

movie driver [ files | raw |
avi | qt ] 
movie video [ ppm | pgm | jpeg | rgb | gray | 422 | 422p |
rgb15 | 
rgb24 | mjpeg | jpeg | raw | mjpa | png ] 
movie fps  
movie audio [ mono8 | mono16 | stereo ] 
movie rate  
movie fvideo  
movie faudio  
movie start 
movie stop

control xawtv&rsquo;s movie
recorder.

fullscreen

Toggle fullscreen mode.

showtime

Display time (same what the
&rsquo;D&rsquo; key does in xawtv).

msg text

Display text on the on-screen
display (window title / upper left corner in fullscreen
mode).

vtx line1 line2 [ ...
]

Display subtitles. It pops up a
small window at the bottom of the screen. It is intended to
be used as an interface for displaying subtitles (often on
videotext page 150 in Europe, that&rsquo;s why the name) by
external programs. 
Every command line argument is one line, zero lines removes
the window. You can colorize the text with the control
sequence "ESC foreground background".
foreground/background has the range 0-7 (ansi term colors).
Example: "\03347 hello world " is blue on white.
"\033" must be a real escape character, the string
doesn&rsquo;t work. With the bash you&rsquo;ll get it with
^V ESC. vtx does also understand the ANSI tty escape
sequences for color.

quit

quit xawtv

keypad n

enter digit &rsquo;n&rsquo;.
That&rsquo;s the two-digit channel selection, entering two
digits within 5 seconds switches to the selected station.
Useful for lirc.

vdr command

send "command" to vdr
(via connect on localhost:2001).
