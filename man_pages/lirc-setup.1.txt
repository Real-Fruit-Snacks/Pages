SYNOPSIS

lirc-setup
[output directory]

DESCRIPTION

A simple GUI
tool which creates a lirc configuration after some user
dialogs which defines driver, device, modprobe actions, etc.
The results are written as separate files in the output
directory which defaults to lirc-setup.conf.d

FILES

configs

The lirc hardware database. By
default the file is searched for in ., .., /usr/share/lirc
and the dir where lirc-setup lives. configs is a directory
with a separate file for each meny entry. See the
configs/README.

lirc-setup.conf.d

The output directory. On normal
exits this contains at least a lircd.conf and
lirc_options.conf file. Optional files lirc-modprobe.conf
and lircmd.conf

Several other
support files are downloaded from the lirc website as part
of the configuration process.
