NAME

sd_bus_message_at_end
- Check if a message has been fully read

SYNOPSIS

#include

int
sd_bus_message_at_end(sd_bus_message *m,
int complete); 

DESCRIPTION

sd_bus_message_at_end()
returns whether all data from the currently opened container
in m or all data from all containers in m has
been read. If complete is zero, this function returns
whether all data from the currently opened container has
been read. If complete is non-zero, this function
returns whether all data from all containers in m has
been read.

RETURN VALUE

If all data
from all containers or the current container (depending on
the value of complete) has been read,
sd_bus_message_at_end() returns a positive integer.
If there is still data left to be read, it returns zero. On
failure, it returns a negative errno-style error code.

Errors

Returned errors may indicate the following problems:

-EINVAL

The m parameter is
NULL.

Added in
version 246.

-EPERM

The message is not sealed.

Added in
version 246.

NOTES

Functions
described here are available as a shared library, which can
be compiled against and linked to with the
libsystemd pkg-config(1) file.

The code
described here uses getenv(3), which is declared to
be not multi-thread-safe. This means that the code calling
the functions described here must not call setenv(3)
from a parallel thread. It is recommended to only do calls
to setenv() from an early phase of the program when
no other threads have been started.

HISTORY
