SEM_CLOSE(3POSIX)          POSIX Programmer's Manual         SEM_CLOSE(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       sem_close — close a named semaphore

SYNOPSIS
       #include <semaphore.h>

       int sem_close(sem_t *sem);

DESCRIPTION
       The sem_close() function shall indicate that  the  calling  process  is
       finished  using  the  named semaphore indicated by sem.  The effects of
       calling  sem_close()  for  an  unnamed  semaphore   (one   created   by
       sem_init())  are  undefined.  The sem_close() function shall deallocate
       (that is, make available for reuse by a subsequent sem_open()  by  this
       process)  any  system resources allocated by the system for use by this
       process for this semaphore. The effect of subsequent use of  the  sema‐
       phore  indicated by sem by this process is undefined. If any threads in
       the calling process are currently blocked on the semaphore, the  behav‐
       ior  is  undefined.   If the semaphore has not been removed with a suc‐
       cessful call to sem_unlink(), then sem_close() has  no  effect  on  the
       state  of the semaphore. If the sem_unlink() function has been success‐
       fully invoked for name after the most recent call  to  sem_open()  with
       O_CREAT  for  this  semaphore, then when all processes that have opened
       the semaphore close it, the semaphore is no longer accessible.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, a value of zero shall be returned.   Other‐
       wise, a value of -1 shall be returned and errno set to indicate the er‐
       ror.

ERRORS
       The sem_close() function may fail if:

       EINVAL The sem argument is not a valid semaphore descriptor.
