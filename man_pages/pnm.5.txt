The PNM Format(5)             File Formats Manual            The PNM Format(5)

NAME
       pnm - Netpbm superformat

DESCRIPTION
       The PNM format is just an abstraction of the PBM, PGM, and PPM formats.
       I.e. the name "PNM" refers collectively to PBM, PGM, and PPM.

       The name "PNM" is an acronym derived from "Portable Any Map." This der‐
       ivation makes more sense if you consider it in the context of the other
       Netpbm format names: PBM, PGM, and PPM.

       The more general term "Netpbm format" refers to the  PNM  formats  plus
       PAM.

       PNM is principally used with Netpbm(1).

       Note  that  besides  being names of formats, PBM, PGM, PPM, and PNM are
       also classes of programs.  A PNM program can take PBM, PGM, or PPM  in‐
       put.   That's nothing special -- a PPM program can too.  But a PNM pro‐
       gram can often produce multiple output formats as well, and a PNM  pro‐
       gram can see the difference between PBM, PGM, and PPM input and respond
       to each differently whereas a PPM program sees everything as if it were
       PPM.  This is discussed more in the description of the netpbm programs"
       (1).

       "pnm" also appears in the names of the most general Netpbm library rou‐
       tines(1), some of which aren't even related to the PNM format.

INTERNET MEDIA TYPE
       No  Internet  Media Type (aka MIME type, content type) for PNM has been
       registered with the IANA, but the value image/x-portable-anymap is con‐
       ventional.

       Note  that there are also conventional Internet Media Types for each of
       the PNM subformats.  The recommended practice is to use those in  pref‐
       erence to the PNM code when it is convenient to do so.

FILE NAME
       There are no requirements on the name of a PNM file, but the convention
       is to use the suffix "pbm", "pgm", or "ppm", depending on the  particu‐
       lar subformat, or "pnm" if it is not convenient to distinguish the sub‐
       formats.
