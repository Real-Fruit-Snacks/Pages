DESCRIPTION

The pt driver provides
support for a SCSI processor type device. These are usually
scanners and other devices using the SCSI link as a
communication interface with device specific commands
embedded in the data stream.

A SCSI adapter
must be separately configured into the system before this
driver can be used.

This device
supports read(2) and write(2), and the ioctl(2) calls
described below.
