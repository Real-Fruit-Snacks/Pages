NAME

sssctl - SSSD
control and status utility

SYNOPSIS

sssctl COMMAND
[options] 

DESCRIPTION

sssctl
provides a simple and unified way to obtain information
about SSSD status, such as active server, auto-discovered
servers, domains and cached objects. In addition, it can
manage SSSD data files for troubleshooting in such a way
that is safe to manipulate while SSSD is running.

AVAILABLE COMMANDS

To list all
available commands run sssctl without any parameters.
To print help for selected command run sssctl COMMAND
--help.

COMMON OPTIONS

Those options
are available with all commands.

--debug
LEVEL

SSSD supports two
representations for specifying the debug level. The simplest
is to specify a decimal value from 0-9, which represents
enabling that level and all lower-level debug messages. The
more comprehensive option is to specify a hexadecimal
bitmask to enable or disable specific levels (such as if you
wish to suppress a level).

Currently
supported debug levels:

0,
0x0010: Fatal failures. Anything that would prevent
SSSD from starting up or causes it to cease running.

1,
0x0020: Critical failures. An error that doesn't kill
SSSD, but one that indicates that at least one major feature
is not going to work properly.

2,
0x0040: Serious failures. An error announcing that a
particular request or operation has failed.

3,
0x0080: Minor failures. These are the errors that
would percolate down to cause the operation failure of
2.

4,
0x0100: Configuration settings.

5,
0x0200: Function data.

6,
0x0400: Trace messages for operation functions.

7,
0x1000: Trace messages for internal control
functions.

8,
0x2000: Contents of function-internal variables that
may be interesting.

9,
0x4000: Extremely low-level tracing information.

10,
0x10000: Even more low-level libldb tracing
information. Almost never really required.

To log required
bitmask debug levels, simply add their numbers together as
shown in following examples:

Example:
To log fatal failures, critical failures, serious failures
and function data use 0x0270.

Example:
To log fatal failures, configuration settings, function
data, trace messages for internal control functions use
0x1310.

Note:
The bitmask format of debug levels was introduced in
1.7.0.

Default:
0x0070 (i.e. fatal, critical and serious failures;
corresponds to setting 2 in decimal notation)
