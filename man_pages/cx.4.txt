CX(4) BSD/i386 Kernel Interfaces Manual CX(4)

NAME

cx — driver for
synchronous/asynchronous Cronyx Sigma WAN adapters

SYNOPSIS

To compile this driver into the
kernel, place the following line in your kernel
configuration file:

device
cx

Alternatively,
to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following line in loader.conf(5):

if_cx_load="YES"

Additional
options:

device sppp 
options NETGRAPH 
options NETGRAPH_CRONYX

In
/boot/device.hints:

hint.cx.0.at="isa"

hint.cx.0.port="0x240" 
hint.cx.0.irq="15" 
hint.cx.0.drq="7"

DESCRIPTION

The cx driver needs
either sppp(4) or netgraph(4). Which one to use is
determined by the NETGRAPH_CRONYX option. If this option is
present in your kernel configuration file, the cx
driver will be compiled with netgraph(4) support. Otherwise,
it will be compiled with sppp(4) support.

The base I/O
port address specified in /boot/device.hints must
match the port address set by the jumpers on the board. The
DMA I/O channel and interrupt request numbers are configured
by software at adapter initialization. Legal values are:

Port:

0x240, 0x260,
0x280, 0x300, 0x320, 0x380

IRQ:

3, 5, 7, 10,
11, 12, 15

DMA:

5, 6, 7

The cx
driver supports autodetection. As for all non-PNP hardware,
using autodetection could lead to some potential problems
with other devices during the hardware detection process. It
is always better to specify hardware resources manually.

Refer to
sconfig(8) for information about the cx adapter
configuration.

HARDWARE

HISTORY

The cx driver was updated
in FreeBSD 5.2 and FreeBSD 4.10. In most of the
previous versions of FreeBSD the cx driver is out of
date. The cx driver for previous versions of FreeBSD
is available from http://www.cronyx.ru/.
