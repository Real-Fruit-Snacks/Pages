NAME

pamtowinicon -
convert Netpbm PAM images to a Microsoft Windows icon
file

SYNOPSIS

pamtowinicon
[-pngthreshold=threshold]
[-truetransparent] [-verbose]
[pam_file]

All options can
be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix. You may use
two hyphens instead of one to designate an option. You may
use either white space or equals signs between an option
name and its value.

DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

pamtowinicon
reads an RGB_ALPHA Netpbm PAM file and converts it to a
Microsoft Windows icon file.

The output goes
to Standard Output.

The input is a
multi-image PAM file; each image becomes an icon in the
output file. If you have input images in multiple files, you
can simply combine them with cat and pass the result
to pamtowinicon.

OPTIONS

In addition to
the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most
notably -quiet, see
Common Options ),
pamtowinicon recognizes the following command line
options: 
-pngthreshold=threshold

pamtowinicon encodes
images with resolutions above or equal threshold by
threshold as PNG by running pnmtopng(1). Other
images it encodes using the more traditional BMP format.

When the
program uses PNG encoding for a 5-channel PAM with separate
AND mask (see below), it discards the AND mask. Because PNG
has always had the ability to specify transparency, the
Windows icon format does not provide for a separate and mask
when the icon is encoded in PNG.

The default
value for threshold is 128.

-truetransparent

Make all pixels outside the
opaque area black, avoiding inversion and other effects on
the background of the image (see Windows
Icons(1)).

-verbose

IMAGES

pamtowinicon
reads a (multi-image) Netpbm PAM file as input and outputs
an single Windows icon file containing those images.

The images in
the icon file are in the same order as in the PAM input.

PAM Input

pamtowinicon interprets the PAM images as follows, based
on the number of channels.

The tuple types
of the PAMs are irrelevant.

AND Mask

The so-called "AND mask" is a special feature of
Microsoft Windows icons. It is required for all BMP encoded
images. At the first sight, the AND mask is a 1-bit
transparency channel, but it is also used for e.g. shading
the icon while dragging. See Windows Icons(1) for
details.

If there is no
explicit AND mask, but transparency data in the input image,
pamtowinicon sets the AND mask to opaque where the
sample in the transparency channel is below maxval, and to
transparent elsewhere.

If no
transparency data is present in the input image,
pamtowinicon assumes the whole image to be fully
opaque.

BMP
Output 
When BMP encoding an image, pamtowinicon tries to use
the most compact BI_RGB format allowed for icon
images with a color depth of eight bits per channel.

pamtowinicon
generates neither 16-bit BI_RGB nor
BI_BITFIELDS BMP encoded images, even if the maxval
of the input PAM is not 255.

HISTORY

pamtowinicon
was new in Netpbm 10.63 (June 2013). It obsoleted
ppmtowinicon by providing more function and
conforming better to Netpbm conventions.
