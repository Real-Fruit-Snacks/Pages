NAME

gfs2_edit -
Display, print or edit GFS2 or GFS internal structures.

SYNOPSIS

gfs2_edit
[OPTION]... [DEVICE]

DESCRIPTION

The gfs2_edit
command is a tool used to examine, edit or display internal
data structures of a GFS2 or GFS file system. The gfs2_edit
command can be run interactively, as described below in
INTERACTIVE MODE.

Caution:
Several options of the gfs2_edit command alter the file
system metadata and can cause file system corruption. These
options should be used with great care.

OPTIONS

-p
[struct | block] [blocktype]
[blockalloc [val]] [blockbits] 
[blockrg] [find
sb|rg|rb|di|in|lf|jd|lh|ld|ea|ed|lb|13|qc] [field

 [val]]

Print a gfs2 data structure in
human-readable format to stdout. You can enter either a
block number or a data structure name. Block numbers may be
specified in hex (e.g., 0x10) or decimal (e.g., 16).

You can specify
the following well-known locations with the -p option.

sb,
superblock - Print the superblock.

root -
Print the root directory.

master -
Print the master system directory.

jindex -
Print the journal index system directory.

per_node
- Print the per_node system directory.

inum -
Print the system inum file.

statfs -
Print the system statfs file.

rindex,
rgindex - Print the resource group index system
file.

rg X -
Print the resource group information for RG X
(zero-based).

rgs -
Print the resource group information.

quota -
Print the contents of the system quota file.

identify
- Identify a data block rather than print the block&rsquo;s
contents.

size -
Print the device size information.

journalX
- Print the contents of journal X, where X is a journal
number from 0 to . Only the journal headers and journal
descriptors are dumped. For journal descriptors, this option
prints out every file system block number logged in that
section of the journal. The actual journaled blocks are not
printed.

If you specify
a block number rather than a structure name, gfs2_edit will
print out a breakdown of the structure for that block. For
example: gfs2_edit -p sb will print the superblock,
but so does gfs2_edit -p 0x10 and gfs2_edit -p
16.

If you specify
-p without a block or structure name, gfs2_edit prints the
superblock.

You can specify
more than one data structure with a single -p option. For
example, gfs2_edit -p inum statfs /dev/sda1 prints
the system inum file and the system statfs file on
/dev/sda1.

Optionally, you
may specify the keyword blocktype to print out the
gfs2 block type for the specified block. Valid gfs2 block
types are: 0 (Clump), 1 (Superblock), 2 (Resource Group
Header), 3 (Resource Group Bitmap), 4 (Dinode), 5 (Indirect
Block), 6 (Leaf), 7 (Journaled data), 8 (Log Header), 9 (Log
descriptor), 10 (Extended attribute), 11 (Eattr Data), 12
(Log Buffer), 13 (Invalid), and 14 (Quota Change).

Optionally, you
may specify the keyword blockalloc with an optional
value to assign. If no value is specified, the blockalloc
keyword will print the block allocation type for the
specified block. Valid block allocation types are: 0 (Free
block), 1 (Data block), 2 (Unlinked block), and 3 (Metadata
block). If a value from 0 to 3 is specified, the resource
group bitmap will be changed to the new value. This may be
used, for example, to artificially free or allocate a block
in order to test fsck.gfs2&rsquo;s ability to detect and fix
the problem.

Optionally, you
may specify the keyword blockbits. This option will
locate and print the block containing the bitmap
corresponding to the specified block.

Optionally, you
may specify the keyword blockrg. This option will
locate and print the block number of the resource group that
holds information about the specified block.

You may also
use gfs2_edit to find the next occurrence of a metadata
block of a certain type. Valid metadata types are:
none (unused metadata clump block), sb
(superblock), rg (resource group), rb (rg
bitmap), di (disk inode aka dinode), in
(indirect block list), lf (directory leaf), jd
(journaled data), lh (journal log header), ld
(journal log descriptor), ea (extended attribute),
ed (ea data block), lb (log buffer), 13
(unused block type 13), qc (quota change). The block
AFTER the one specified with -p is the starting point for
the search. For example, if you specify gfs2_edit -p rg
12 find rg /dev/your/device, it will find the rg that
follows rg 12 (normally, this would be rg 13). Note,
however, that since metadata often appears in the journals,
it could be a copy of a different RG, inside a journal. Also
note that gfs2_edit will only find allocated metadata
blocks unless the type specified is none, sb, rg or rb. In
other words, if you try to find a disk inode, it will only
find an allocated dinode, not a deallocated one.

Optionally, you
may specify the keyword field followed by a valid
metadata field name. Right now, only the fields in disk
inodes and resource groups are allowed. If no value is
specified after the field, the value of the field will be
printed to stdout. If a value is specified, the
field&rsquo;s value will be changed. This may be used, for
example, to artificially change the di_size field for an
inode in order to test fsck.gfs2&rsquo;s ability to detect
and fix the problem.

-s [structure |
block]

Specify a starting block for
interactive mode. Any of the well-known locations found in
the -p option may be specified. If you want to start on a
particular resource group, specify it in quotes, e.g. -s
"rg 3"

-h, -help, -usage

Print help information.

-c [0 |
1]

Use alternate color scheme for
interactive mode: 0=normal (dark colors on white
background), or 1 (light colors on black background).

-V

Print program version information only.

-x

Print in hex mode.

-z 

Compress metadata with gzip
compression level 1 to 9 (default 9). 0 means no compression
at all.

rg 

Print the contents of Resource
Group  on .

is a number from 0 to X - 1, where X is the number of
RGs.

rgcount

Print the number of Resource
Groups in the file system on .

rgflags
 [new_value]

Print and/or modify the
rg_flags value of Resource Group  on
.

is a number from 0 to X - 1, where X is the number of RGs.
If new_value is not specified, the current rg_flags
value will be printed but not modified. If new_value
is specified, the rg_flags field will be overwritten with
the new value.

printsavedmeta

Print off a list of blocks from
 that were saved with the savemeta
option.

savemeta

Save off the GFS2 metadata (not
user data) for the file system on the specified device to a
file given by . You can use this option to
analyze file system problems without revealing sensitive
information that may be contained in the files. This option
works quickly by using the system bitmap blocks in the
resource groups to determine the location of all the
metadata. If there is corruption in the bitmaps, resource
groups or rindex file, this method may fail and you may need
to use the savemetaslow option. The destination file is
compressed using gzip unless -z 0 is specified.

savemetaslow

Save off GFS2 metadata, as with
the savemeta option, examining every block in the file
system for metadata. This option is less prone to failure
due to file system corruption than the savemeta option, but
it is extremely slow. The destination file is compressed
using gzip unless -z 0 is specified.

savergs

Save off only the GFS2 resource
group metadata for the file system on the specified device
to a file given by . The destination file is
compressed using gzip unless -z 0 is specified.

restoremeta

Take a compressed or
uncompressed file created with the savemeta option and
restores its contents on top of the specified destination
device. WARNING: When you use this option, the file
system and all data on the destination device is destroyed.
Since only metadata (but no data) is restored, every file in
the resulting file system is likely to be corrupt. The ONLY
purpose of this option is to examine and debug file system
problems by restoring and examining the state of the saved
metadata. If the destination file system is the same size or
larger than the source file system where the metadata was
saved, the resulting file system will be the same size as
the source. If the destination device is smaller than the
source file system, gfs2_edit will restore as much as it
can, then quit, leaving you with a file system that probably
will not mount, but from which you might still be able to
figure out what is wrong with the source file system.

INTERACTIVE MODE

If you specify
a device on the gfs2_edit command line and you specify no
options other than -c, gfs2_edit will act as an interactive
GFS2 file system editor for the file system you specify.
There are three display modes: hex mode, structure mode and
pointers mode. You use the m key to switch between the
modes, as described below. The modes are as follows: 
Hex mode (default)

Display or edit blocks of the
file system in hexadecimal and ascii.

Lines at the
top indicate the currently displayed block in both hex and
decimal. If the block contains a GFS2 data structure, the
name of that structure will appear in the upper right corner
of the display. If the block is a well-known block, such as
the superblock or rindex, there will be a line to indicate
what it is.

In hex mode,
you can edit blocks by pressing  and
entering hexadecimal digits to replace the highlighted hex
digits. Do NOT precede the numbers with "0x". For
example, if you want to change the value at offset 0x60 from
a 0x12 to 0xef, position your cursor to offset 0x60, so that
the 12 is highlighted, then press  and
type in "ef". Press  or
 to exit edit mode.

In hex mode,
different colors indicate different things. For example, in
the default color scheme, the GFS2 data structure will be
black, data offsets will be light blue, and actual data
(anything after the gfs2 data structure) will be red.

Structure mode

Decode the file system block
into its GFS2 structure and display the values of that
structure. This mode is most useful for jumping around the
file system. For example, you can use the arrow keys to
position down to a pointer and press J to jump to
that block.

Pointers mode

Display any additional
information appearing on the block. For example, if an inode
has block pointers, this will display them and allow you to
scroll through them. You can also position to one of them
and press J to jump to that block.

Interactive mode command keys:

q or

The q or
 keys are used to exit gfs2_edit.

 up, down, right, left, pg-up, pg-down, home,
end

The arrow keys are used to
highlight an area of the display. The J key may be
used to jump to the block that is highlighted.

m - Mode switch

The m key is used to
switch between the three display modes. The initial mode is
hex mode. Pressing the m key once switches to
structure mode. Pressing it a second time switches from
structure mode to pointers mode. Pressing it a third time
takes you back to hex mode again.

j - Jump to block

The j key jumps to the
block number that is currently highlighted. In hex mode,
hitting J will work when any byte of the pointer is
highlighted.

g - Goto block

The g key asks for a
block number, then jumps there. Note that in many cases, you
can also arrow up so that the current block number is
highlighted, then press  to enter a
block number to jump to.

h - Help display

The h key causes the
interactive help display to be shown.

e - Extended mode

The e key causes
gfs2_edit to switch to extended ("pointers")
mode.

c - Color scheme

The c key causes
gfs2_edit to switch to its alternate color scheme.

f - Forward block

The f key causes you to
scroll forward one block. This does not affect the
"jump" status. In other words, if you use the
f key to move forward several blocks, pressing
 will not roll you back up.

 - Edit
value

The  key
causes you to go from display mode to edit mode. If you are
in hex mode and you hit enter, you can type new hex values
at the cursor&rsquo;s current location. Note: pressing
 in structure mode allows you to enter a
new value, with the following restrictions: For gfs2 disk
inodes and resource groups, it will actually change the
value on disk. However, inode numbers may not be changed.
For all other structures, the values entered are
ignored.

If you use the
up arrow key to highlight the block number, then press
, you may then enter a new block number,
or any of the well-known block locations listed above (e.g.
sb, rindex, inum, rg 17, etc.) and gfs2_edit will jump to
the block specified. If you specify a slash character
followed by a metadata type, gfs2_edit will search for the
next occurrence of that metadata block type, and jump there.
It will take you to block 0 if it does not find any more
blocks of the specified metadata type.

If you are in pointers mode, this takes you back to the
starts of the pointers you are viewing. Otherwise it takes
you back to the superblock.

This takes you back to the
block you were displaying before a jump.

This takes you forward to the
block you were displaying when you hit
.
