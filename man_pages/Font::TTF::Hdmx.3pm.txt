NAME
       Font::TTF::Hdmx - Horizontal device metrics

DESCRIPTION
       The table consists of an hash of device metric tables indexed by the
       ppem for that subtable. Each subtable consists of an array of advance
       widths in pixels for each glyph at that ppem (horizontally).

INSTANCE VARIABLES
       Individual metrics are accessed using the following referencing:

           $f->{'hdmx'}{$ppem}[$glyph_num]

       In addition there is one instance variable:

       Num Number of device tables.

   METHODS
   $t->read
       Reads the table into data structures

   $t->out($fh)
       Outputs the device metrics for this font

   $t->minsize()
       Returns the minimum size this table can be. If it is smaller than this,
       then the table must be bad and should be deleted or whatever.

   $t->tables_do(&func)
       For each subtable it calls &sub($ref, $ppem)

   $t->XML_element($context, $depth, $key, $value)
       Outputs device metrics a little more tidily

BUGS
       None known
