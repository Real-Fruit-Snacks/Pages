NAME

opannotate
&minus; produce source or assembly annotated with profile
data

SYNOPSIS

opannotate
[ options ] [profile specification]

DESCRIPTION

opannotate
outputs annotated source and/or assembly from profile data
of an OProfile session. See oprofile(1) for how to write
profile specifications.

OPTIONS

--assembly /
-a

Output annotated assembly. If
this is combined with --source, then mixed source / assembly
annotations are output.

--demangle / -D
none|smart|normal

none: no demangling. normal:
use default demangler (default) smart: use pattern-matching
to make C++ symbol demangling more readable.

--exclude-dependent /
-x

Do not include
application-specific images for libraries, kernel modules
and the kernel. This option only makes sense if the profile
session used --separate.

--exclude-file
[files]

Exclude all files in the given
comma-separated list of glob patterns.

--exclude-symbols / -e
[symbols]

Exclude all the symbols in the
given comma-separated list.

--help / -? /
--usage

Show help message.

--image-path / -p
[paths]

Comma-separated list of
additional paths to search for binaries. This is needed to
find modules in kernels 2.6 and upwards.

--root / -R [path]

A path to a filesystem to
search for additional binaries.

--include-file
[files]

Only include files in the given
comma-separated list of glob patterns.

--include-symbols / -i
[symbols]

Only include symbols in the
given comma-separated list.

--objdump-params
[params]

Pass the given parameters as
extra values when calling objdump.

--output-dir / -o
[dir]

Output directory. This makes
opannotate output one annotated file for each source file.
This option can&rsquo;t be used in conjunction with
--assembly.

--search-dirs / -d
[paths]

Comma-separated list of paths
to search for source files. You may need to use this option
when the debug information for an image contains relative
paths.

--base-dirs / -b
[paths]

Comma-separated list of paths
to strip from debug source files, prior to looking for them
in --search-dirs.

--session-dir=dir_path

Use sample database out of
directory dir_path instead of the default location
(/var/lib/oprofile).

--source / -s

Output annotated source. This
requires debugging information to be available for the
binaries.

--threshold / -t
[percentage]

Only output data for symbols
that have more than the given percentage of total
samples.

--verbose / -V
[options]

Give verbose debugging
output.

--version / -v

Show version.

ENVIRONMENT

No special
environment variables are recognised by opannotate.

FILES

/var/lib/oprofile/samples/

The location of the generated
sample files.
