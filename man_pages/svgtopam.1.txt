NAME
       svgtopam  -  convert  an SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) image to Netpbm
       format

SYNOPSIS
       svgtopam [-trace] [pnmfile]

       Minimum unique abbreviation of option is acceptable.  You may use  dou‐
       ble  hyphens  instead  of single hyphen to denote options.  You may use
       white space in place of the equals sign to separate an option name from
       its value.

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       svgtopam  reads  an  SVG  (Scalable Vector Graphics) image as input and
       produces a PAM image as output.

       svgtopam is so weak that it is probably not useful in general for  con‐
       verting  SVG images.  It understands only <path> SVG elements which use
       only the "M", "L", and "z" commands, and only those that use whole num‐
       ber  arguments.   This  is sufficient for converting most of what comes
       out of pamtosvg (not by coincidence - the program was developed for the
       specific  task  of testing pamtosvg), but the main reason it is part of
       Netpbm is to provide a base for someone to create a full SVG to  Netpbm
       converter.

       SVG is a vector image format, which means it describes curves that com‐
       pose an image.  By contrast, PNM is a raster format, which means it de‐
       scribes  dots that compose an image.  The main practical difference be‐
       tween the two types is that you can scale vector images better.  A vec‐
       tor  image also takes a lot less data to describe an image if the image
       is composed of simple curves.

       That means it is really an understatement to say that  svgtopam  is  an
       image  format  converter.  It's really an image drawer, not unlike ppm‐
       draw.

OPTIONS
       In  addition  to  the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm
       (most notably -quiet, see
        Common Options ⟨index.html#commonoptions⟩ ), svgtopam  recognizes  the
       following command line option:

       -trace This  option  makes svgtopam issue messages describing the draw‐
              ing.

HISTORY
       svgtopam was added to Netpbm in Version 10.34 (May 2006).

       Bryan Henderson created svgtopam to test pamtosvg.
