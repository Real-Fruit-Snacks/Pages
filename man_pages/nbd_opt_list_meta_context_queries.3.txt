NAME

nbd_opt_list_meta_context_queries
- list available meta contexts, using explicit query
list

SYNOPSIS

#include

typedef struct { 
int (*callback) (void *user_data, const char *name); 
void *user_data; 
void (*free) (void *user_data); 
} nbd_context_callback; 
int nbd_opt_list_meta_context_queries ( 
struct nbd_handle *h, char **queries, 
nbd_context_callback context_callback 
);

DESCRIPTION

Request that
the server list available meta contexts associated with the
export previously specified by the most recent
nbd_set_export_name(3) or nbd_connect_uri(3),
and with an explicit list of queries provided as a parameter
(see nbd_opt_list_meta_context(3) if you want to
reuse an implicit query list instead). This can only be used
if nbd_set_opt_mode(3) enabled option mode.

The NBD
protocol allows a client to decide how many queries to ask
the server. For this function, the list is explicit in the
"queries" parameter. When the list is empty, a
server will typically reply with all contexts that it
supports; when the list is non-empty, the server will reply
only with supported contexts that match the client&rsquo;s
request. Note that a reply by the server might be encoded to
represent several feasible contexts within one string,
rather than multiple strings per actual context name that
would actually succeed during nbd_opt_go(3); so it is
still necessary to use nbd_can_meta_context(3) after
connecting to see which contexts are actually supported.

The
"context" function is called once per server
reply, with any "user_data" passed to this
function, and with "name" supplied by the server.
Remember that it is not safe to call
nbd_add_meta_context(3) from within the context of
the callback function; rather, your code must copy any
"name" needed for later use after this function
completes. At present, the return value of the callback is
ignored, although a return of -1 should be avoided.

For
convenience, when this function succeeds, it returns the
number of replies returned by the server.

Not all servers
understand this request, and even when it is understood, the
server might intentionally send an empty list because it
does not support the requested context, or may encounter a
failure after delivering partial results. Thus, this
function may succeed even when no contexts are reported, or
may fail but have a non-empty list. Likewise, the NBD
protocol does not specify an upper bound for the number of
replies that might be advertised, so client code should be
aware that a server may send a lengthy list.

RETURN VALUE

This call
returns an integer &ge; 0.

ERRORS

On error -1 is
returned.

Refer to
"ERROR HANDLING" in libnbd(3) for how to
get further details of the error.

The following
parameters must not be NULL: "h",
"queries". For more information see "Non-NULL
parameters" in libnbd(3).
