COMSAT(8) BSD System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
COMSAT(8)

NAME

comsat &mdash; biff
server

SYNOPSIS

comsat

DESCRIPTION

Comsat is the server
process which receives reports of incoming mail and notifies
users if they have requested this service. Comsat
receives messages on a datagram port associated with the
&rsquo;&rsquo;biff&rsquo;&rsquo; service specification (see
services(5) and inetd(8)). The one line messages are of the
form:

user@mailbox-offset:/path/to/mailbox

If the
user specified is logged in to the system and the
associated terminal has the owner execute bit turned on (by
a &rsquo;&rsquo;biff y&rsquo;&rsquo;), the offset is
used as a seek offset into the appropriate mailbox file and
the first 7 lines or 560 characters of the message are
printed on the user&rsquo;s terminal. Lines which appear to
be part of the message header other than the
&rsquo;&rsquo;From&rsquo;&rsquo; or
&rsquo;&rsquo;Subject&rsquo;&rsquo; lines are not included
in the output.

FILES 
/var/run/utmp

to find out
who&rsquo;s logged on and on what terminals

SEE ALSO

biff(1), inetd(8)

BUGS

The message header filtering is
prone to error. The density of the information presented is
near the theoretical minimum.

Users should be
notified of mail which arrives on other machines than the
one to which they are currently logged in.

The notification
should appear in a separate window so it does not mess up
the screen.

Please report
bugs to netbug [AT] ftp.org and include diffs/patches,
compiler error logs or as complete a bug report as you are
able.
