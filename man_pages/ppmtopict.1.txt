NAME
       ppmtopict - convert a PPM image to a Macintosh PICT file

SYNOPSIS
       ppmtopict

       [ppmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       ppmtopict reads a PPM image as input and produces a Macintosh PICT file
       as output.

       The generated file is only the data fork of a picture.  You will need a
       program  such  as  mcvert to generate a Macbinary or a BinHex file that
       contains the necessary information to identify the file as a PICT  file
       to MacOS.

       Even though PICT can have 2 and 4 bits per pixel, ppmtopict always gen‐
       erates an 8 bits per pixel file.

OPTIONS
       There are no command line options defined specifically  for  ppmtopict,
       but it recognizes the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm
       (See
        Common Options ⟨index.html#commonoptions⟩ .)

LIMITATIONS
       The picture size field is correct only if the output is to a file since
       writing  into this field requires seeking backwards on a file.  However
       the PICT documentation seems to suggest that this field is not critical
       anyway since it is only the lower 16 bits of the picture size.
