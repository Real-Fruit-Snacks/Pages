DESCRIPTION

This driver is obsolete.
Users are advised to use cfumass(4)
instead.

The usfs
driver provides support for emulating an USB mass storage
device when the USB stack is activated in USB device side
mode (the usb_template(4) module is loaded and the
hw.usb.template sysctl is set to 0).

Upon attach the
driver creates a RAM disk which can be read and written.
