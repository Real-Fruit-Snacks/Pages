MAILER.CONF(5) BSD File Formats Manual
MAILER.CONF(5)

NAME

mailer.conf â€”
configuration file for mailwrapper(8)

DESCRIPTION

The file
/etc/mail/mailer.conf contains a series of pairs. The
first member of each pair is the name of a program invoking
mailwrapper(8) which is typically a symbolic link to
/usr/sbin/sendmail. (On a typical system,
newaliases(1) and mailq(1) would be set up this way.) The
second member of each pair is the name of the program to
actually execute when the first name is invoked. The file
may also contain comments, denoted by a # mark in the first
column of any line.

EXAMPLES

The following is an example of
how to set up an mailer.conf for traditional sendmail
invocation behavior.

# Execute the
"real" sendmail program, named
/usr/libexec/sendmail/sendmail

sendmail

/usr/libexec/sendmail/sendmail

send-mail

/usr/libexec/sendmail/sendmail

mailq

/usr/libexec/sendmail/sendmail

newaliases

/usr/libexec/sendmail/sendmail

This example
shows how to invoke a sendmail-workalike like Postfix in
place of sendmail.

# Emulate
sendmail using postfix

sendmail

/usr/local/sbin/sendmail

send-mail

/usr/local/sbin/sendmail

mailq

/usr/local/sbin/sendmail

newaliases

/usr/local/sbin/sendmail

FILES

/etc/mail/mailer.conf

BUGS

The entire reason this program
exists is a crock. Instead, a command for how to submit mail
should be standardized, and all the "behave differently
if invoked with a different name" behavior of things
like mailq(1) should go away.
