NAME

hardened-cc
&minus; gcc wrapper to enforce hardening toolchain
improvements

SYNOPSIS

export
DEB_BUILD_HARDENING=1

gcc
...

DESCRIPTION

The
hardened-cc wrapper is normally used by calling
gcc as usual when DEB_BUILD_HARDENING is set
to 1. It will configure the necessary toolchain hardening
features. By default, all features are enabled. If a given
feature does not work correctly and needs to be disabled,
the corresponding environment variables mentioned below can
be set to 0.

ENVIRONMENT

DEB_BUILD_HARDENING=1

Enable hardening features.

DEB_BUILD_HARDENING_DEBUG=1

Print the full resulting gcc
command line to STDERR before calling gcc.

DEB_BUILD_HARDENING_STACKPROTECTOR=0

Disable stack overflow
protection. See README.Debian for details.

DEB_BUILD_HARDENING_RELRO=0

Disable read-only linker
sections. See README.Debian for details.

DEB_BUILD_HARDENING_FORTIFY=0

Don&rsquo;t fortify several
standard functions. See README.Debian for details.

DEB_BUILD_HARDENING_PIE=0

Don&rsquo;t build position
independent executables. See README.Debian for details.

DEB_BUILD_HARDENING_FORMAT=0

Disable unsafe format string
usage errors. See README.Debian for details.

NOTES

System-wide
settings can be added to /etc/hardening-wrapper.conf,
one per line.

The real
gcc symlinks are renamed gcc.real, and a
diversion is registered with dpkg-divert(1). Thus
hardened-cc&rsquo;s idea of the default gcc is
dictated by whatever package installed
/usr/bin/gcc.
