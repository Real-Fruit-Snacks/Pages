NAME

cmap_iter_init
- Initialize iterator for keys stored in CMAP

SYNOPSIS

#include

cs_error_t
cmap_iter_init (cmap_handle_t handle, const
char *prefix, cmap_iter_handle_t
*cmap_iter_handle);

DESCRIPTION

The
cmap_iter_init function is used to initialize
iteration of all keys with given prefix. The
handle argument is connection to CMAP database
obtained by calling cmap_initialize(3) function.
prefix is string, and every returned key must have
name with given prefix. This variable can also be NULL (or
empty string) and then all keys are iterated.

cmap_iter_init
is used only for initialize context for future
cmap_iter_next(3) calls and handle needed for that
function is returned in cmap_iter_handle variable.
When you have finished iteration over objects, call
cmap_iter_finalize(3) function to free up memory
associated with iteration.

RETURN VALUE

This call
returns the CS_OK value if successful. If there are no items
with given prefixes, CS_ERR_NO_SECTIONS is returned.
