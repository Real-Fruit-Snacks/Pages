policy stub module

SYNOPSIS

To compile the stub policy into
your kernel, place the following lines in your kernel
configuration file:

options MAC

options MAC_STUB

load the stub module at boot time, place the following line
in your kernel configuration file:

DESCRIPTION

The mac_stub policy
module implements a stub MAC policy that has no effect on
access control in the system. Unlike mac_none(4), each MAC
entry point is defined as a
&rsquo;&rsquo;no-op&rsquo;&rsquo;, so the policy module will
be entered for each event, but no change in system behavior
should result.

Label
Format 
No labels are defined for mac_stub.

BUGS

While the MAC Framework design
is intended to support the containment of the root user, not
all attack channels are currently protected by entry point
checks. As such, MAC Framework policies should not be relied
on, in isolation, to protect against a malicious privileged
user.
