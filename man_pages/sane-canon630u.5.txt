NAME

sane-canon630u
- SANE backend for the Canon 630u USB flatbed scanner

DESCRIPTION

The
sane-canon630u library implements a SANE (Scanner
Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to the
following Canon flatbed scanners:

CanoScan 630u

CanoScan 636u

Color scanning
is supported at 75, 150, 300, and 600 dpi, and gamma and
analog gain are adjustable.

TESTERS ARE
WELCOME. Send your bug reports and comments to Nathan Rutman

CONFIGURATION

The contents of
the canon630u.conf file is a list of device names
that correspond to Canon USB scanners. Empty lines and lines
starting with a hash mark (#) are ignored. Only one device
name can be listed in canon630u.conf. The program
sane-find-scanner helps to find out the correct
device. Under Linux, such a device name could be
/dev/usb/scanner0 for example. See sane-usb(5) for
details.

This
product-specific scanner driver uses the lower-level kernel
USB driver "scanner". Check for
"Driver=usbscanner" under /proc/bus/usb/devices.
If "Driver=(none)", try forcing it with
"insmod scanner vendor=0x04a9 product=0x2204"

NOTES

Due to
Canon&rsquo;s unwillingness to provide scanner
documentation, this software was developed by analyzing the
USB traffic of the Windows 2000 driver. So things like the
calibration procedure I kind of made up; it seems to work
for my scanner. If you have complaints, let me know.

This driver
requires the ability to send USB Control Messages, available
in kernel 2.4.12 or later.

Some users have
reported that this driver doesn&rsquo;t work at all. This
seems to be a hardware specific issue, although I
don&rsquo;t know what exactly the problem is. If you are
having problems, please send me the info in
/proc/bus/usb/devices, /proc/pci, the kernel scanner.c
driver version from /var/log/messages, and the output from
"SANE_DEBUG_CANON630U=12 scanimage >
/dev/null"

FILES

/etc/sane.d/canon630u.conf

The backend configuration file
(see also description of SANE_CONFIG_DIR below).

/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-canon630u.a

The static library implementing
this backend.

/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-canon630u.so

The shared library implementing
this backend (present on systems that support dynamic
loading).

/tmp/canon.cal

The calibration file used to
normalize pixel brightness. This is calculated every time
the scanner is first used after it has lost power. Deleting
this file will force recalibration.

ENVIRONMENT

SANE_CONFIG_DIR

This environment variable
specifies the list of directories that may contain the
configuration file. Under UNIX, the directories are
separated by a colon (&rsquo;:&rsquo;), under OS/2, they are
separated by a semi-colon (&rsquo;;&rsquo;). If this
variable is not set, the configuration file is searched in
two default directories: first, the current working
directory (".") and then in /etc/sane.d. If the
value of the environment variable ends with the directory
separator character, then the default directories are
searched after the explicitly specified directories. For
example, setting SANE_CONFIG_DIR to
"/tmp/config:" would result in directories
"tmp/config", ".", and
"/etc/sane.d" being searched (in this order).

SANE_DEBUG_CANON630U

If the library was compiled
with debug support enabled, this environment variable
controls the debug level for this backend. Higher debug
levels increase the verbosity of the output.

Example: 
SANE_DEBUG_CANON630U=12 scanimage > /dev/null
