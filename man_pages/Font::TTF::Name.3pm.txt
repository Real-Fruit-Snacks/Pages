NAME
       Font::TTF::Name - String table for a TTF font

DESCRIPTION
       Strings are held by number, platform, encoding and language. Strings
       are accessed as:

           $f->{'name'}{'strings'}[$number][$platform_id][$encoding_id]{$language_id}

       Notice that the language is held in an associative array due to its
       sparse nature on some platforms such as Microsoft ($pid = 3). Notice
       also that the array order is different from the stored array order
       (platform, encoding, language, number) to allow for easy manipulation
       of strings by number (which is what I guess most people will want to
       do).

       By default, $Font::TTF::Name::utf8 is set to 1, and strings will be
       stored as UTF8 wherever possible. The method "is_utf8" can be used to
       find out if a string in a particular platform and encoding will be
       returned as UTF8. Unicode strings are always converted if utf8 is
       requested. Otherwise, strings are stored according to platform:

       You now have to set <$Font::TTF::Name::utf8> to 0 to get the old
       behaviour.

       Apple Unicode (platform id = 0)
           Data is stored as network ordered UCS2. There is no encoding id for
           this platform but there are language ids as per Mac language ids.

       Mac (platform id = 1)
           Data is stored as 8-bit binary data, leaving the interpretation to
           the user according to encoding id.

       Unicode (platform id = 2)
           Currently stored as 16-bit network ordered UCS2. Upon release of
           Perl 5.005 this will change to utf8 assuming current UCS2 semantics
           for all encoding ids.

       Windows (platform id = 3)
           As per Unicode, the data is currently stored as 16-bit network
           ordered UCS2. Upon release of Perl 5.005 this will change to utf8
           assuming current UCS2 semantics for all encoding ids.

INSTANCE VARIABLES
       strings
           An array of arrays, etc.

METHODS
   $t->read
       Reads all the names into memory

   $t->out($fh)
       Writes out all the strings

   $t->XML_element($context, $depth, $key, $value)
       Outputs the string element in nice XML (which is all the table really!)

   $t->XML_end($context, $tag, %attrs)
       Store strings in the right place

   $t->minsize()
       Returns the minimum size this table can be. If it is smaller than this,
       then the table must be bad and should be deleted or whatever.

   is_utf8($pid, $eid)
       Returns whether a string of a given platform and encoding is going to
       be in UTF8

   find_name($nid)
       Hunts down a name in all the standard places and returns the string and
       for an array context the pid, eid & lid as well

   remove_name($nid)
       Removes all strings with the given name id from the table.

   set_name($nid, $str[, $lang[, @cover]])
       Sets the given name id string to $str for all platforms and encodings
       that this module can handle. If $lang is set, it is interpretted as a
       language tag and if the particular language of a string is found to
       match, then that string is changed, otherwise no change occurs.

       If supplied, @cover should be a list of references to two-element
       arrays containing pid,eid pairs that should be added to the name table
       if not already present.

       This function does not add any names to the table unless @cover is
       supplied.

   Font::TTF::Name->match_lang($pid, $lid, $lang)
       Compares the language associated to the string of given platform and
       language with the given language tag. If the language matches the tag
       (i.e. is equal or more defined than the given language tag) returns
       true. This is calculated by finding whether the associated language tag
       starts with the given language tag.

   Font::TTF::Name->get_lang($pid, $lid)
       Returns the language tag associated with a particular platform and
       language id

   Font::TTF::Name->find_lang($pid, $lang)
       Looks up the language name and returns a lang id if one exists

   Font::TTF::Name->pe_list()
       Returns an array of references to two-element arrays containing pid,eid
       pairs that already exist in this name table.  Useful for creating
       @cover parameter to set_name().

BUGS
       o   Unicode type strings will be stored in utf8 for all known
           platforms, once Perl 5.6 has been released and I can find all the
           mapping tables, etc.
