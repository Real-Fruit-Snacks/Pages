TALKD(8) System Manager&rsquo;s Manual TALKD(8)

NAME

talkd &mdash; remote user
communication server

SYNOPSIS

talkd
[options]

DESCRIPTION

talkd is the server that
notifies a user that someone else wants to initiate a
conversation. It acts as a repository of invitations,
responding to requests by clients wishing to rendezvous to
hold a conversation. In normal operation, a client, the
caller, initiates a rendezvous by sending a CTL_MSG to the
server of type LOOK_UP (see &lang;
protocols/talkd.h&rang; ). This causes the server to
search its invitation tables to check if an invitation
currently exists for the caller (to speak to the callee
specified in the message). If the lookup fails, the caller
then sends an ANNOUNCE message causing the server to
broadcast an announcement on the callee&rsquo;s login ports
requesting contact. When the callee responds, the local
server uses the recorded invitation to respond with the
appropriate rendezvous address and the caller and callee
client programs establish a stream connection through which
the conversation takes place.
