NAME

cmds −
ceph metadata server daemon

SYNOPSIS

cmds
−i name [ −−rank
rank ] [ −−shadow rank
]

DESCRIPTION

cmds is
the metadata server daemon for the Ceph distributed file
system. One or more instances of cmds collectively
manage the file system namespace, coordinating access to the
shared OSD cluster.

Each
cmds daemon instance should have a unique
name. The name is used to identify daemon instances
in the ceph.conf.

Once the daemon
has started, the monitor cluster will normally assign it a
logical rank, or put it in a standby pool to take over for
another daemon that crashes. If a specific rank may be
optionally specified on the command line, the daemon will be
assigned that rank, or will be put in a separate standby
queue specifically for that rank.

OPTIONS

−−mds
rank

Start up as (or standby for)
the given MDS rank. If not specified, a rank will be
assigned by the monitor cluster. −−shadow
rank Shadow a the given MDS rank. The given MDS
log will be replayed, checking for recovery errors.

−D

Debug mode: do not daemonize after startup (run in
foreground) and send log output to stdout.

−f

do not daemonize after startup (run in foreground), but
log to the usual location. Useful when run via
crun(8). 

−c
ceph.conf,
−−conf=ceph.conf

Use ceph.conf
configuration file instead of the default
/etc/ceph/ceph.conf to determine monitor addresses
during startup.

−m
monaddress[:port]

Connect to specified monitor
(instead of looking through ceph.conf).
