NAME

approx.conf -
configuration file for approx proxy server

SYNOPSIS

/etc/approx/approx.conf

DESCRIPTION

Each non-blank
line of the configuration file should contain a name/value
pair, separated by white space. Comments start with a
"#" character and continue to the end of the
line.

Names that
begin with the "$" character are reserved for use
as configuration parameters. The following parameters are
currently defined:

$cache

Specifies the location of the approx cache directory
(default: /var/cache/approx). It and all its
subdirectories must be owned by the approx server (see also
the $user and $group parameters, below.)

$interval

Specifies the time in minutes
after which a cached file will be considered too old to
deliver without first checking with the remote repository
for a newer version (default: 60)

$max_rate

Specifies the maximum download
rate from remote repositories, in bytes per second (default:
unlimited). The value may be suffixed with "K",
"M", or "G" to indicate kilobytes,
megabytes, or gigabytes per second, respectively.

$max_redirects

Specifies the maximum number of
HTTP redirections that will be followed when downloading a
remote file (default: 5)

$user, $group

Specifies the user and group
that owns the files in the approx cache (default:
approx)

$syslog

Specifies the syslog(3)
facility to use when logging (default: daemon)

$pdiffs

Specifies whether to support
IndexFile diffs (default: true)

$offline

Specifies whether to deliver
(possibly out-of-date) cached files when they cannot be
downloaded from remote repositories (default:
false)

$max_wait

Specifies how many seconds an
approx(8) process will wait for a concurrent download
of a file to complete, before attempting to download the
file itself (default: 10)

$curl_path

Specifies the path to the curl
binary (default: /usr/bin/curl)

$verbose

Specifies whether informational
messages should be printed in the log (default:
false)

$debug

Specifies whether debugging messages should be printed
in the log (default: false)

The other
name/value pairs are used to map distribution names to
remote repositories. For example,

debian
http://ftp.debian.org/debian 
debian-security
http://security.debian.org/debian-security

TCP PORT NUMBER

The port on
which approx(8) listens is not specified in this
file, but in /etc/inetd.conf. The default value is
9999, for compatibility with apt-proxy(8), but it may
be changed by running the command

dpkg-reconfigure
approx
