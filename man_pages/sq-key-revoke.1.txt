NAME

sq key revoke -
Revoke a certificate

SYNOPSIS

sq key
revoke [OPTIONS] REASON MESSAGE

DESCRIPTION

Revoke a
certificate.

Creates a
revocation certificate for the certificate.

If
&rsquo;--revocation-file&rsquo; is provided, then that key
is used to create the signature. If that key is different
from the certificate being revoked, this creates a
third-party revocation. This is normally only useful if the
owner of the certificate designated the key to be a
designated revoker.

If
&rsquo;--revocation-file&rsquo; is not provided, then the
certificate must include a certification-capable key.

&rsquo;sq key
revoke&rsquo; respects the reference time set by the
top-level &rsquo;--time&rsquo; argument. When set, it uses
the specified time instead of the current time, when
determining what keys are valid, and it sets the revocation
certificate&rsquo;s creation time to the reference time
instead of the current time.

OPTIONS

Subcommand
options 
-B, --binary

Emit binary data

--certificate-file=FILE

Read the certificate to revoke
from FILE or stdin, if omitted. It is an error for the file
to contain more than one certificate.

--notation NAME
VALUE

Add a notation to the
certification. A user-defined notation&rsquo;s name must be
of the form &rsquo;name [AT] a.org&rsquo;. If
the notation&rsquo;s name starts with a &rsquo;!&rsquo;,
then the notation is marked as being critical. If a consumer
of a signature doesn&rsquo;t understand a critical notation,
then it will ignore the signature. The notation is marked as
being human readable.

-o,
--output=FILE

Write to FILE or stdout if
omitted

--private-key-store=KEY_STORE

Provide parameters for private
key store

--revocation-file=KEY_FILE

Sign the revocation certificate
using the key in KEY_FILE. If the key is different from the
certificate, this creates a third-party revocation. If this
option is not provided, and the certificate includes secret
key material, then that key is used to sign the revocation
certificate.

REASON

The reason for the revocation.
This must be either: &rsquo;compromised&rsquo;,
&rsquo;superseded&rsquo;, &rsquo;retired&rsquo;, or
&rsquo;unspecified&rsquo;:

-
&rsquo;compromised&rsquo; means that the secret key material
may have been 
compromised. Prefer this value if you suspect that the
secret 
key has been leaked.

-
&rsquo;superseded&rsquo; means that the owner of the
certificate has replaced 
it with a new certificate. Prefer &rsquo;compromised&rsquo;
if the secret 
key material has been compromised even if the certificate is
also 
being replaced! You should include the fingerprint of the
new 
certificate in the message.

-
&rsquo;retired&rsquo; means that this certificate should not
be used anymore, 
and there is no replacement. This is appropriate when
someone 
leaves an organisation. Prefer &rsquo;compromised&rsquo; if
the secret key 
material has been compromised even if the certificate is
also 
being retired! You should include how to contact the owner,
or 
who to contact instead in the message.

-
&rsquo;unspecified&rsquo; means that none of the three other
three reasons 
apply. OpenPGP implementations conservatively treat this
type 
of revocation similar to a compromised key.

If the reason
happened in the past, you should specify that using the
&rsquo;--time&rsquo; argument. This allows OpenPGP
implementations to more accurately reason about objects
whose validity depends on the validity of the
certificate.

MESSAGE

A short, explanatory text that
is shown to a viewer of the revocation certificate. It
explains why the certificate has been revoked. For instance,
if Alice has created a new key, she would generate a
&rsquo;superseded&rsquo; revocation certificate for her old
key, and might include the message &rsquo;I&rsquo;ve created
a new certificate, FINGERPRINT, please use that in the
future.&rsquo;
