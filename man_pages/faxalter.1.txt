NAME

faxalter -
alter parameters of a Hyla FAX job
queued for transmission

SYNOPSIS

faxalter
[ options ] id...

DESCRIPTION

faxalter
changes the state of one or more Hyla
FAX jobs that are queued for
transmission. Numerous parameters can be altered; see the
options below.

An id is
a number that identifies a job that has been
submitted to Hyla FAX ; these numbers
are printed by sendfax(1) when jobs are queued for
transmission and can also be displayed with
faxstat(1). Unprivileged users can alter the
parameters of jobs that they own; clients with
administrative privileges on a server can manipulate any job
(see the -A option below). The user may be specified
by the FAXUSER environment variable. By default,
faxalter contacts the facsimile server on the host
specified in the FAXSERVER environment variable; but
consult the -h option for more information.

OPTIONS

-a time

Specify a new time to send a
job. The syntax for specifying a time is the same as used by
sendfax(1) (and at(1)).

-d
destination

Change the destination number
to destination.

-h host

Force the server to be contacted on a specific
host. The host may be either a symbolic name
or a network address. If no -h option is supplied,
faxalter uses the FAXSERVER
environment variable to identify the Hyla
FAX server to contact. If this variable
is not set, then faxalter checks for a setting in the
configuration files (first in the per-user file and then in
the system-wide file). If all of the above fails, then
faxalter attempts to contact a server on the machine
where it is run.

-A

Use administrative privileges; faxalter will
prompt for the password to set administrative
privileges. 

-k time

Specify a new time to kill a job; the syntax is the same
as used for the -a option.

-m modem

Assign/reassign the jobs to the specified modem.
Specifying ’’any’’ for modem
causes the jobs to be scheduled for any available modem.

-p

The jobs should be pushed; that is, they should
be requeued with a time-to-send as the current time (this is
equivalent to ’’-a now’’).

-P pri

Set the scheduling priority for the specified jobs. The
priority is an integer value in the range 0-255; lower
values give a job higher priority. The default scheduling
priority for a job is 127 and priorities are recalculated
after each attempt to process a job.

-r

Resubmits a job. This will duplicate any job that is in
either the send queue or in the done queue. When
resubmitting jobs that are past their killtime the -k
option should also be used to specify a new time to kill the
job. 

-t tries

Set the maximum number of times the server should call
the remote fax machine.

-n scheme

Select a notification scheme to use for the specified
jobs. Possible schemes are:
’’none’’ for no notification
(default), ’’when done’’ for
notification when the job is completed,
’’when requeued’’ for
notification when the job is requeued after a failed
transmission attempt. The -Q, -D, and
-R options are shorthand for these notification
schemes, respectively. One can also leave off
’’when’’ when using the
-n option; e.g.,
’’done’’ instead of
’’when done’’.

-v

Trace the protocol exchanges between faxalter and
the remote hfaxd process. Tracing information is
written to the standard output.

-Z range

Change the page range to be faxed to range

CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS

faxalter
reads configuration information from the file
/etc/hylafax/hyla.conf and then from the file
~/.hylarc. Configuration files follow the conventions
described in hylafax-client(1). The following
configuration parameters are recognized: 
Tag Type Default Description

Host

string

localhost

host to contact for service

PassiveMode

boolean

false

whether or not to use passive mode

Port

integer

4559

port to use in contacting server

Protocol

string

tcp

protocol to use in contacting server

Verbose

boolean

No

whether or not to enable protocol tracing

The
configuration parameters are explained below:

Host

The host to contact for service.
(Equivalent to the -h option.)

PassiveMode

Whether or not to use passive
mode in communication with the server.

Port

The network port to contact for service. (Equivalent to
the -h option.)

Protocol

The name of the communication protocol to use when
contacting a server. (Equivalent to the FAXSERVICE
environment variable.)

Verbose

Control protocol tracing. (Equivalent to the -v
option.) 

NOTES

Setting a
job’s killtime without also setting the time to send
may cause the wrong value for the killtime to be sent. This
is because the killtime is calculated as the difference in
time between the killtime and time to send: and if the time
to send is not specified, then faxalter uses the
current time instead of querying the server for the
job’s time to send.

faxalter
suspends a job before attempting to alter its state. If a
job is active when a suspend request is made there may be a
delay while waiting for the job to enter a consistent state
where it can be suspended. If faxalter is interrupted
during this time then jobs may be left suspended.

faxalter
requeues the job. This means that the job will end up at the
bottom of the queue for the job’s priority. Thus, when
queues are heavy an adjustment of the job’s killtime
may need to be considered when altering any other
parameter.

faxalter
only understands how to alter a subset of the available job
parameters; there are many more client-controllable
parameters that can only be modified by communicating
directly with the server using the underlying protocol.

The continued
use of the at(1)-style notation for specifying times
is questionable (it was done for backwards
compatibility).
