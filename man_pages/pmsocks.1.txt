NAME

pmsocks
- shell wrapper for performance monitoring across
firewalls

SYNOPSIS

pmsocks
path [args ...]

DESCRIPTION

pmsocks
allows Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) clients running on hosts
located on the internal side of a TCP/IP firewall to monitor
remote hosts on the other side of the firewall. This assumes
the firewall has been configured with a compliant
sockd daemon and the necessary access controls are
satisfied.

pmsocks
is a thin shell wrapper around the tsocks(8) library
using the tsocks(1) utility, which are not included
with PCP. You can obtain tsocks from
https://tsocks.sourceforge.net/.
