WATCH(8) BSD System Manager&rsquo;s Manual WATCH(8)

NAME

watch &mdash; snoop on
another tty line

SYNOPSIS

watch
[&minus;cinotW] [&minus;f snpdev]
[tty]

DESCRIPTION

The watch utility allows
the user to examine all data coming through a specified tty
using the snp(4) device. If the snp(4) device is not
available, watch will attempt to load the module
(snp). The watch utility writes to standard
output.

The options are
as follows:

&minus;c

Reconnect on
close. If the tty observed by watch is closed,
automatically reattach to the same tty. If this option is
not specified, watch will request a new tty if
running in interactive mode or exit if running without a
controlling tty.

&minus;f
snpdev

If this option is specified,
watch will use snpdev as the snp(4) device.
Without this option, watch will attempt to find the
next available snp(4) device.

&minus;i

Force
interactive mode. Interactive mode is a default if
watch is started from a tty. If output is redirected
to a file, interactive mode can still be requested by
specifying this option.

&minus;n

Disable the
ability to switch the watched tty interactively. This
disables both change requests made with  as
well as automatic prompting when the current tty is closed
or overflows. In all cases where a prompt would be
displayed, watch will exit. The reconnect flags are
unaffected by this option. When this flag is used,
 is passed through to the terminal.

&minus;o

Reconnect on
overflow. The behavior of watch if the observed tty
overflows is similar to the behavior if the observed tty is
closed. For more info see snp(4).

&minus;t

Print the date
and time when observation of a given tty is started.

&minus;W

Allow write
access to observed tty.

tty

Tty may be
specified as a tty-style device, such as a pseudo tty
device, a virtual console, or a serial line, etc. Names may
be preceded by /dev/.

OPERATION

While running in interactive
mode, all user input is discarded except for:

Exit watch.

Clear screen.

Change attached tty, unless
this feature is disabled, in which case control-X is passed
to the terminal as with other control characters.

BUGS

No terminal emulation is
performed. All user output is reproduced as-is.
