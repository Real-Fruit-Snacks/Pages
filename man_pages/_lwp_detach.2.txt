NAME

_lwp_detach
&minus; detach an LWP

SYNOPSIS

#include

int
_lwp_detach(lwpid_t target_lwp);

DESCRIPTION

The
_lwp_detach() function marks the LWP specified by
target_lwp as being a detached LWP. The effect is the
same as if target_lwp had been created using the
LWP_DETACHED flag (see _lwp_create(2)).

The
target_lwp must be a non-detached LWP within the same
process as the calling LWP.

RETURN VALUES

Upon successful
completion, 0 is returned. A non-zero value indicates
an error.

ERRORS

If any of the
following conditions occur, _lwp_detach() fails and
returns the corresponding value: 
EINVAL

The LWP with the ID specified
by target_lwp is already detached.

ESRCH

No LWP with the ID specified by target_lwp can be
found in the current process.
