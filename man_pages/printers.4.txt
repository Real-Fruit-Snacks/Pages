printers
&minus; user-configurable printer alias database

SYNOPSIS

$HOME/.printers

DESCRIPTION

The
$HOME/.printers file is a simplified version of the
system /etc/printers.conf file (see
printers.conf(4)). Users create the
$HOME/.printers file in their home directory. This
optional file is customizable by the user.

The
$HOME/.printers file performs the following
functions:

1.

Sets personal aliases for all print commands.

2.

Sets the interest list for the lpget,
lpstat, and cancel commands. See
lpget(1M), lpstat(1) and

cancel(1).

3.

Sets the default printer for the
lp, lpr, lpq, and lprm commands.
See lp(1), lpr(1B), lpq(1B), and
lprm(1B). 

Entries

Use a line or full screen editor to create or modify the
$HOME/.printers file.

Each entry in
$HOME/.printers describes one destination. Entries
are one line consisting of two fields separated by either
BLANKs or TABs and terminated by a NEWLINE. Format for an
entry in $HOME/.printers varies according to the
purpose of the entry.

Empty lines can
be included for readability. Entries may continue on to
multiple lines by adding a backslash
(&rsquo;\&rsquo;) as the last character in the line.
The $HOME/.printers file can include comments.
Comments have a pound sign (&rsquo;#&rsquo;) as the
first character in the line, and are terminated by a
NEWLINE.

Setting
Personal Aliases

Specify the
alias or aliases in the first field. Separate multiple
aliases by a pipe sign (&rsquo;|&rsquo;). Specify the
destination in the second field. A destination names a
printer or class of printers (see lpadmin(1M)).
Specify the destination using atomic, POSIX-style
(server:destination), or Federated
Naming Service (FNS) (.../service/printer/...)
names. See printers.conf(4) for information regarding
the naming conventions for atomic and FNS names, and
standards(5) for information regarding POSIX.

Setting the
Interest List for lpget, lpstat and cancel

Specify
_all in the first field. Specify the list of
destinations for the interest list in the second field.
Separate each destinations by a comma
(&rsquo;,&rsquo;). Specify destinations using atomic,
POSIX-style (server:destination), or
FNS names
(.../service/printer/...). See
printers.conf(4) for information regarding the naming
conventions for atomic and FNS names. This list of
destinations may refer to an alias defined in
$HOME/.printers.

Setting the
Default Destination

Specify
_default in the first field. Specify the default
destination in the second field. Specify the default
destination using atomic, POSIX-style
(server:destination), or FNS
names (.../service/printer/...). See
printers.conf(4) for information regarding the naming
conventions for atomic and FNS names. The default
destination may refer to an alias defined in
$HOME/.printers.

Locating
Destination Information 
The print client commands locate destination information
based on the "printers" database entry in the
/etc/nsswitch.conf file. See
nsswitch.conf(4).

Locating the
Personal Default Destination

The default
destination is located differently depending on the
command.

The lp
command locates the default destination in the following
order:

1.

lp command&rsquo;s
-d destination option.

2.

LPDEST environment variable.

3.

PRINTER environment variable.

4.

_default destination in
$HOME/.printers. 

5.

_default destination in
/etc/printers.conf. 

6.

_default destination in FNS.

The lpr,
lpq, and lprm commands locate the default
destination in the following order:

1.

lpr command&rsquo;s
-P destination option.

2.

PRINTER environment variable.

3.

LPDEST environment variable.

4.

_default destination in
$HOME/.printers. 

5.

_default destination in
/etc/printers.conf. 

6.

_default destination in FNS.

Locating the
Interest List for lpget, lpstat, and cancel

The
lpget, lpstat, and cancel commands
locate the interest list in the following order:

1.

_all list in
$HOME/.printers. 

2.

_all list in /etc/printers.conf.

3.

_all list in FNS.

Example 3:
Setting an alias as a default destination

The following
entry sets the alias pcl to hplj and sets it

NOTES

$HOME/.printers
is referenced by the printing commands before further name
resolution is made in /etc/printers.conf or the name
service. If the alias references a destination defined in
/etc/printers.conf, it is possible that the
destination is defined differently on different systems.
This could cause output to be sent to an unintended
destination if the user is logged in to a different
system.
