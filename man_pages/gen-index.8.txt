] [ -h | --help ]

DESCRIPTION

Builds an index
for the specified GNATS database. The index is printed to
standard output by default.

OPTIONS

-n,
--numeric

Sorts index entries numerically
rather than by their order in the categories list.

-d
databasename,
--database=databasename

Specifies the database to be
indexed. If no database is specified, the database named
default is assumed. This option overrides the
database specified in the GNATSDB environment
variable.

-o outfile,
--outfile=outfile

Prints the index to
outfile rather than to the standard output.

-i, --import

Import the existing index file
instead of re-indexing the database.

-e, --export

Force plaintext output

-h, --help

Prints usage for
gen&minus;index.

-V, --version

Prints the version number of
gen&minus;index.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

The
GNATSDB environment variable is used to determine
which database to use. For a local database, it contains the
name of the database to access.

For network
access via gnatsd, it contains a colon-separated list
of strings that describe the remote database, in the form

server:port:databasename:username:password

Any of the
fields may be omitted, but at least one colon must appear;
otherwise, the value is assumed to be the name of a local
database.

If
GNATSDB is not set, it is assumed that the database
is local and that its name is default.
