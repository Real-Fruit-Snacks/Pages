NAME

lat_udp -
measure interprocess communication latency via UDP/IP

SYNOPSIS

lat_udp
-s 
lat_udp [ -m  ] [ -P
 ] [ -W  ] [
-N  ] hostname 
lat_udp -S hostname

DESCRIPTION

lat_udp
is a client/server program that measures interprocess
communication latencies. The benchmark passes a message back
and forth between the two processes (this sort of benchmark
is frequently referred to as a &rsquo;&rsquo;hot
potato&rsquo;&rsquo; benchmark). No other work is done in
the processes.

lat_udp
has three forms of usage: as a server (-s), as a client
(lat_udp localhost), and as a shutdown (lat_udp -S
localhost).

OUTPUT

The reported
time is in microseconds per round trip and includes the
total time, i.e., the context switching overhead is
included. Output format is like so

UDP latency
using localhost: 650 microseconds

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

Funding for the
development of this tool was provided by Sun Microsystems
Computer Corporation.
