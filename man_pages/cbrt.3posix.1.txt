CBRT(3POSIX)               POSIX Programmer's Manual              CBRT(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       cbrt, cbrtf, cbrtl — cube root functions

SYNOPSIS
       #include <math.h>

       double cbrt(double x);
       float cbrtf(float x);
       long double cbrtl(long double x);

DESCRIPTION
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with  the
       ISO C  standard.  Any  conflict between the requirements described here
       and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017
       defers to the ISO C standard.

       These functions shall compute the real cube root of their argument x.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon  successful completion, these functions shall return the cube root
       of x.

       If x is NaN, a NaN shall be returned.

       If x is ±0 or ±Inf, x shall be returned.

ERRORS
       No errors are defined.

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       None.

RATIONALE
       For some applications, a true cube root function, which  returns  nega‐
       tive  results  for  negative arguments, is more appropriate than pow(x,
       1.0/3.0), which returns a NaN for x less than 0.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
