NAME

tgz - makes a
gzip’d tar archive

SYNOPSIS

tgz [
destination [ source ... ] ]

DESCRIPTION

Make a
gzip’d tar archive with the name of the first
parameter out of specified files or, if no source files are
specified, from everything in the current directory. If the
first parameter is omitted as well, the archive will be
written to stdout.

BUGS

tgz
requires gzip in the user’s path. It also needs gnu
tar or something close due to use of --exclude, --totals and
-S.
