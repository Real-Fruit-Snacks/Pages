NAME

stap-prep -
prepare system for systemtap use

SYNOPSIS

stap-prep
[ KERNEL_VERSION ]

DESCRIPTION

The stap-prep
executable prepares the system for systemtap use by
installing kernel headers, debug symbols and build tools
that match the currently running kernel or optionally the
kernel version given by the user.

If the
debuginfod-find tool is installed and is able to fetch
debuginfo for a kernel component, it is assumed to remain
available later. In this case, no debug symbols will be
downloaded during stap-prep.

The exact
behavior of stap-prep may be customized by the distribution
maintainers. It might for example only give suggestions and
not actually install the required packages if that is
difficult to automate.

EXAMPLES

$ stap-prep

Please install linux-image-3.2.0-2-amd64-dbg
