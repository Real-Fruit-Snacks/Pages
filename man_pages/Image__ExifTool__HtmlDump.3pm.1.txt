NAME
       Image::ExifTool::HtmlDump - Dump information in hex to HTML page

SYNOPSIS
           use Image::ExifTool::HtmlDump;
           my $dump = new Image::ExifTool::HtmlDump;
           $dump->Add($start, $size, $comment);
           $dump->Print($dumpInfo, $raf, $dataPt, $dataPos, $outfile);

DESCRIPTION
       This module contains code used to generate an HTML-based hex dump of
       information for debugging purposes.  This is code is called when the
       ExifTool 'HtmlDump' option is used.

       Currently, only EXIF/TIFF and JPEG information is dumped.

BUGS
       Due to a memory allocation bug in ActivePerl 5.8.x for Windows, this
       code may run extremely slowly when processing large files with this
       version of Perl.

       An HTML 4 compliant browser is needed to properly display the generated
       HTML page.
