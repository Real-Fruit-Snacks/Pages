NAME

postdrop -
Postfix mail posting utility

SYNOPSIS

postdrop
[-rv] [-c config_dir]

DESCRIPTION

The
postdrop(1) command creates a file in the
maildrop directory and copies its standard input to
the file.

Options:

-c config_dir

The main.cf
configuration file is in the named directory instead of the
default configuration directory. See also the MAIL_CONFIG
environment setting below.

-r

Use a Postfix-internal protocol for reading the message
from standard input, and for reporting status information on
standard output. This is currently the only supported
method. 

-v

Enable verbose logging for debugging purposes. Multiple
-v options make the software increasingly verbose. As
of Postfix 2.3, this option is available for the super-user
only. 

SECURITY

The command is
designed to run with set-group ID privileges, so that it can
write to the maildrop queue directory and so that it
can connect to Postfix daemon processes.

DIAGNOSTICS

Fatal errors:
malformed input, I/O error, out of memory. Problems are
logged to syslogd(8) or postlogd(8) and to the
standard error stream. When the input is incomplete, or when
the process receives a HUP, INT, QUIT or TERM signal, the
queue file is deleted.

ENVIRONMENT

MAIL_CONFIG

Directory with the
main.cf file. In order to avoid exploitation of
set-group ID privileges, a non-standard directory is allowed
only if:

•

The name is listed in the standard main.cf file
with the alternate_config_directories configuration
parameter. 

•

The command is invoked by the super-user.

CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS

The following
main.cf parameters are especially relevant to this
program. The text below provides only a parameter summary.
See postconf(5) for more details including examples.

alternate_config_directories (empty)

A list of non-default Postfix
configuration directories that may be specified with
"-c config_directory" on the command line (in the
case of sendmail(1), with the "-C" option),
or via the MAIL_CONFIG environment parameter.

config_directory (see
’postconf -d’ output)

The default location of the
Postfix main.cf and master.cf configuration files.

import_environment (see
’postconf -d’ output)

The list of environment
variables that a privileged Postfix process will import from
a non-Postfix parent process, or name=value environment
overrides.

queue_directory (see
’postconf -d’ output)

The location of the Postfix
top-level queue directory.

syslog_facility
(mail)

The syslog facility of Postfix
logging.

syslog_name (see
’postconf -d’ output)

A prefix that is prepended to
the process name in syslog records, so that, for example,
"smtpd" becomes "prefix/smtpd".

trigger_timeout
(10s)

The time limit for sending a
trigger to a Postfix daemon (for example, the
pickup(8) or qmgr(8) daemon).

Postfix version 2.2 and later: 
authorized_submit_users (static:anyone)

List of users who are

local_login_sender_maps (static:*)

A list of lookup tables that
are searched by the UNIX login name, and that return a list
of allowed envelope sender patterns separated by space or
comma.

empty_address_local_login_sender_maps_lookup_key
(<>)

The lookup key to be used in
local_login_sender_maps tables, instead of the null sender
address.

recipient_delimiter
(empty)

The set of characters that can
separate an email address localpart, user name, or a
.forward file name from its extension.
