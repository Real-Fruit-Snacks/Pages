groff_mdoc &mdash;
compose BSD-style manual (man) pages with GNU roff

Synopsis

groff -mdoc file
...

Description

The GNU implementation of the
mdoc macro package is part of the groff(1) document
formatting system. mdoc is a structurally- and
semantically-oriented package for writing UNIX manual pages
with troff(1). Its predecessor, the man(7) package,
primarily addressed page layout and presentational concerns,
leaving the selection of fonts and other typesetting details
to the individual author. This discretion has led to
divergent styling practices among authors using it.

mdoc organizes
its macros into domains. The page structure
domain lays out the page and comprises titles, section
headings, displays, and lists. The general text
domain supplies macros to quote or style text, or to
interpolate common noun phrases. The manual domain
offers semantic macros corresponding to the terminology used
by practitioners in discussion of UNIX commands, routines,
and files. Manual domain macros distinguish command-line
arguments and options, function names, function parameters,
pathnames, variables, cross references to other manual
pages, and so on. These terms are meaningful both to the
author and the readers of a manual page. It is hoped that
the resulting increased consistency of the man page corpus
will enable easier translation to future documentation
tools.

Throughout UNIX
documentation, a manual entry is referred to simply as a
&ldquo;man page&rdquo;, regardless of its length, without
gendered implication, and irrespective of the macro package
selected for its composition.

Getting started

The mdoc package attempts to
simplify man page authorship and maintenance without
requiring mastery of the roff language. This document
presents only essential facts about roff. For further
background, including a discussion of basic typographical
concepts like &ldquo;breaking&rdquo;, &ldquo;filling&rdquo;,
and &ldquo;adjustment&rdquo;, see roff(7). Specialized units
of measurement also arise, namely ens, vees, inches, and
points, abbreviated &ldquo;n&rdquo;, &ldquo;v&rdquo;,
&ldquo;i&rdquo;, and &ldquo;p&rdquo;, respectively; see
section Measurements of groff(7).

For brief
examples, we employ an arrow notation illustrating a
transformation of input on the left to rendered output on
the right. Consider the .Dq macro, which
double-quotes its arguments.

.Dq man page

&rarr;
&ldquo;man page&rdquo;

Usage

An mdoc macro is called by placing the roff
control character, &rsquo;.&rsquo; (dot) at the beginning of
a line followed by its name. In this document, we often
discuss a macro name with this leading dot to identify it
clearly, but the dot is not part of its name. Space
or tab characters can separate the dot from the macro name.
Arguments may follow, separated from the macro name and each
other by spaces, but not tabs. The dot at the
beginning of the line prepares the formatter to expect a
macro name. A dot followed immediately by a newline is
ignored; this is called the empty request. To begin
an input line with a dot (or a neutral apostrophe
&rsquo;'&rsquo;) in some context other than a macro call,
precede it with the &rsquo;\&&rsquo; escape sequence;
this is a dummy character, not formatted for output. The
backslash is the roff escape character; it can appear
anywhere and it always followed by at least one more
character. If followed by a newline, the backslash escapes
the input line break; you can thus keep input lines to a
reasonable length without affecting their
interpretation.

Macros in GNU
troff accept an unlimited number of arguments, in contrast
to other troffs that often can&rsquo;t handle more than
nine. In limited cases, arguments may be continued or
extended on the next input line without resort to the
&rsquo;\newline&rsquo; escape sequence; see
subsection Extended arguments below. Neutral double
quotes " can be used to group multiple words into an
argument; see subsection Passing space characters in an
argument below.

Most of
mdoc&rsquo;s general text and manual domain macros
parse their argument lists for callable macro
names. This means that an argument in the list matching a
general text or manual domain macro name (and defined to be
callable) will be called with the remaining arguments when
it is encountered. In such cases, the argument, although the
name of a macro, is not preceded by a dot. Macro calls can
thus be nested. This approach to macro argument processing
is a unique characteristic of the mdoc package, not a
general feature of roff syntax.

For example, the
option macro, .Op, may call the flag and argument
macros, .Fl and .Ar, to specify an optional
flag with an argument.

.Op Fl s Ar bytes

&rarr;
[-s bytes]

To prevent a word from being
interpreted as a macro name, precede it with the dummy
character.

.Op \&Fl s \&Ar bytes

&rarr; [Fl s Ar
bytes]

In this
document, macros whose argument lists are parsed for
callable arguments are referred to as parsed, and
those that may be called from an argument list are referred
to as callable. This usage is a technical faux
pas, since all mdoc macros are in fact interpreted
(unless prevented with &rsquo;\&&rsquo;), but as it is
cumbersome to constantly refer to macros as &ldquo;being
able to call other macros&rdquo;, we employ the term
&ldquo;parsed&rdquo; instead. Except where explicitly
stated, all mdoc macros are parsed and callable.

In the
following, we term an mdoc macro that starts a line (with a
leading dot) a command if a distinction from those
appearing as arguments of other macros is necessary.

Passing space
characters in an argument 
Sometimes it is desirable to give a macro an argument
containing one or more space characters, for instance to
specify a particular arrangement of arguments demanded by
the macro. Additionally, quoting multi-word arguments that
are to be treated the same makes mdoc work faster; macros
that parse arguments do so once (at most) for each. For
example, the function command .Fn expects its first
argument to be the name of a function and any remaining
arguments to be function parameters. Because C language
standards mandate the inclusion of types and
identifiers in the parameter lists of function definitions,
each &rsquo;Fn&rsquo; parameter after the first will be at
least two words in length, as in &ldquo;int
foo&rdquo;.

There are a few
ways to embed a space in a macro argument. One is to use the
unadjustable space escape sequence \space. The
formatter treats this escape sequence as if it were any
other printable character, and will not break a line there
as it would a word space when the output line is full. This
method is useful for macro arguments that are not expected
to straddle an output line boundary, but has a drawback:
this space does not adjust as others do when the output line
is formatted. An alternative is to use the unbreakable space
escape sequence, &rsquo;\~&rsquo;, which cannot break but
does adjust. This groff extension is widely but not
perfectly portable. Another method is to enclose the string
in double quotes.

.Fn fetch char\ *str

&rarr;
fetch(char *str)

.Fn fetch char\~*str

&rarr;
fetch(char *str)

.Fn fetch "char *str"

&rarr;
fetch(char *str)

If the &rsquo;\&rsquo; before
the space in the first example or the double quotes in the
third example were omitted, &rsquo;.Fn&rsquo; would see
three arguments, and the result would contain an undesired
comma.

.Fn fetch char *str

&rarr;
fetch(char, *str)

Trailing
space characters 
It is wise to remove trailing spaces from the ends of input
lines. Should the need arise to put a formattable space at
the end of a line, do so with the unadjustable or
unbreakable space escape sequences.

Formatting
the backslash glyph 
When you need the roff escape character &rsquo;\&rsquo; to
appear in the output, use &rsquo;\e&rsquo; or
&rsquo;\(rs&rsquo; instead. Technically, &rsquo;\e&rsquo;
formats the current escape character; it works reliably as
long as no roff request is used to change it, which should
never happen in man pages. &rsquo;\(rs&rsquo; is a groff
special character escape sequence that explicitly formats
the &ldquo;reverse solidus&rdquo; (backslash) glyph.

Other
possible pitfalls 
groff mdoc warns when an empty input line is found outside
of a display, a topic presented in subsection
Examples and displays below. Use empty requests to
space the source document for maintenance.

Leading spaces
cause a break and are formatted. Avoid this behaviour if
possible. Similarly, do not put more than one space between
words in an ordinary text line; they are not
&ldquo;normalized&rdquo; to a single space as other text
formatters might do.

Don&rsquo;t try
to use the neutral double quote character
&rsquo;"&rsquo; to represent itself in an argument. Use
the special character escape sequence &rsquo;\(dq&rsquo; to
format it. Further, this glyph should not be used for
conventional quotation; mdoc offers several quotation
macros. See subsection Enclosure and quoting macros
below.

The formatter
attempts to detect the ends of sentences and by default puts
the equivalent of two spaces between sentences on the same
output line; see roff(7). To defeat this detection in a
parsed list of macro arguments, put &rsquo;\&&rsquo;
before the punctuation mark. Thus,

The 
.Ql . 
character. 
.Pp 
The 
.Ql \&. 
character. 
.Pp 
.No test . 
test 
.Pp 
.No test. 
test

gives

The &rsquo;&rsquo;.
character

The
&rsquo;.&rsquo; character.

test. test

test. test

as output. As can be seen in the
first and third output lines, mdoc handles punctuation
characters specially in macro arguments. This will be
explained in section General syntax below.

A comment in the
source file of a man page can begin with
&rsquo;.\"&rsquo; at the start of an input line,
&rsquo;\"&rsquo; after other input, or &rsquo;\#&rsquo;
anywhere (the last is a groff extension); the remainder of
any such line is ignored.

A man page template

Use mdoc to construct a man page
from the following template.

.\" The
following three macro calls are required. 
.Dd date 
.Dt topic [section-identifier [section-keyword-or-title]]

.Os [package-or-operating system [version-or-release]] 
.Sh Name 
.Nm topic 
.Nd summary-description 
.\" The next heading is used in sections 2 and 3. 
.\" .Sh Library 
.\" The next heading is used in sections 1-4, 6, 8, and
9. 
.Sh Synopsis 
.Sh Description 
.\" Uncomment and populate the following sections as
needed. 
.\" .Sh "Implementation notes" 
.\" The next heading is used in sections 2, 3, and 9.

.\" .Sh "Return values" 
.\" The next heading is used in sections 1, 3, 6, and
8. 
.\" .Sh Environment 
.\" .Sh Files 
.\" The next heading is used in sections 1, 6, and 8.

.\" .Sh "Exit status" 
.\" .Sh Examples 
.\" The next heading is used in sections 1, 4, 6, 8,

9. 
.\" .Sh Errors 
.\" .Sh "See also" 
.\" .Sh Standards 
.\" .Sh History 
.\" .Sh Authors 
.\" .Sh Caveats 
.\" .Sh Bugs

The first items
in the template are the commands .Dd, .Dt, and
.Os. They identify the page and are discussed below
in section Title macros.

The remaining
items in the template are section headings (.Sh); of
which Name and Description are mandatory.
These headings are discussed in section Page structure
domain, which follows section Manual domain.
Familiarize yourself with manual domain macros first; we use
them to illustrate the use of page structure domain
macros.

Conventions

In the descriptions of macros
below, square brackets surround optional arguments. An
ellipsis (&rsquo;...&rsquo;) represents repetition of the
preceding argument zero or more times. Alternative values of
a parameter are separated with &rsquo;|&rsquo;. If a
mandatory parameter can take one of several alternative
values, use braces to enclose the set, with spaces and
&rsquo;|&rsquo; separating the items.

ztar 
{c | x} [-w [-y | -z]]
[-f archive] member ...

An alternative to using braces
is to separately synopsize distinct operation modes,
particularly if the list of valid optional arguments is
dependent on the user&rsquo;s choice of a mandatory
parameter.

ztar 
c [-w [-y | -z]] [-f
archive] member ... 
ztar 
x [-w [-y | -z]] [-f
archive] member ...

Most macros
affect subsequent arguments until another macro or a newline
is encountered. For example, &rsquo;.Li ls Bq Ar file&rsquo;
doesn&rsquo;t produce &rsquo;ls [file]&rsquo;, but &rsquo;ls
[file]&rsquo;. Consequently, a warning message is
emitted for many commands if the first argument is itself a
macro, since it cancels the effect of the preceding one. On
rare occasions, you might want to format a word along with
surrounding brackets as a literal.

.Li "ls [file]"

&rarr; ls
[file] # list any files named e, f, i, or l

Many macros
possess an implicit width, used when they are contained in
lists and displays. If you avoid relying on these default
measurements, you escape potential conflicts with site-local
modifications of the mdoc package. Explicit -width
and -offset arguments to the .Bl and
.Bd macros are preferable.

Title macros

We present the mandatory
title macros first due to their importance even though they
formally belong to the page structure domain macros. They
designate the topic, date of last revision, and the
operating system or software project associated with the
page. Call each once at the beginning of the document. They
populate the page headers and footers, which are in roff
parlance termed &ldquo;titles&rdquo;.

.Dd 
date

This first macro of any mdoc
manual records the last modification date of the document
source. Arguments are concatenated and separated with space
characters.

Historically,
date was written in U.S. traditional format,
&ldquo;

Month day , year &rdquo; where
Month is the full month name in English, day
an integer without a leading zero, and year the
four-digit year. This localism is not enforced, however. You
may prefer ISO 8601 format, YYYY-MM-DD. A date
of the form &rsquo;$Mdocdate: Month day year $&rsquo;
is also recognized. It is used in OpenBSD manuals to
automatically insert the current date when committing.

This macro is
neither callable nor parsed.

.Dt topic
[section-identifier
[section-keyword-or-title]]

topic is the subject of
the man page. A section-identifier that begins with
an integer in the range 1&ndash;9 or is one of the words
&rsquo;unass&rsquo;, &rsquo;draft&rsquo;, or
&rsquo;paper&rsquo; selects a predefined section title. This
use of &ldquo;section&rdquo; has nothing to do with the
section headings otherwise discussed in this page; it arises
from the organizational scheme of printed and bound Unix
manuals.

In this
implementation, the following titles are defined for
integral section numbers.

A section title
may be arbitrary or one of the following abbreviations.

For
compatibility, &rsquo;MMI&rsquo; can be used for
&rsquo;IND&rsquo;, and &rsquo;LOC&rsquo; for
&rsquo;LOCAL&rsquo;. Values from the previous table will
specify a new section title. If
section-keyword-or-title designates a computer
architecture recognized by groff mdoc, its value is
prepended to the default section title as specified by the
second parameter. By default, the following architecture
keywords are defined.

acorn26,
acorn32, algor, alpha, amd64, amiga, amigappc, arc, arm,
arm26, arm32, armish, atari, aviion, beagle, bebox, cats,
cesfic, cobalt, dreamcast, emips, evbarm, evbmips, evbppc,
evbsh3, ews4800mips, hp300, hp700, hpcarm, hpcmips, hpcsh,
hppa, hppa64, i386, ia64, ibmnws, iyonix, landisk, loongson,
luna68k, luna88k, m68k, mac68k, macppc, mips, mips64,
mipsco, mmeye, mvme68k, mvme88k, mvmeppc, netwinder,
news68k, newsmips, next68k, ofppc, palm, pc532,
playstation2, pmax, pmppc, powerpc, prep, rs6000, sandpoint,
sbmips, sgi, sgimips, sh3, shark, socppc, solbourne, sparc,
sparc64, sun2, sun3, tahoe, vax, x68k, x86_64, xen,
zaurus

If a
section title is not determined after the above matches have
been attempted, section-keyword-or-title is
used.

The
effects of varying &rsquo;.Dt&rsquo; arguments on the page
header content are shown below. Observe how
&rsquo;\&&rsquo; prevents the numeral 2 from being
used to look up a predefined section title.

roff
strings define section titles and architecture identifiers.
Site-specific additions might be found in the file
mdoc.local; see section Files
below.

This
macro is neither callable nor parsed.

.Os
[operating-system-or-package-name
[version-or-release]]

This macro associates
the document with a software distribution. When composing a
man page to be included in the base installation of an
operating system, do not provide an argument; mdoc will
supply it. In this implementation, that default is
&ldquo;BSD&rdquo;. It may be overridden in the site
configuration file, mdoc.local; see section
Files below. A portable software package maintaining
its own man pages can supply its name and version number or
release identifier as optional arguments. A
version-or-release argument should use the standard
nomenclature for the software specified. In the following
table, recognized version-or-release arguments for
some predefined operating systems are listed. As with
.Dt, site additions might be defined in
mdoc.local.

Historically,
the first argument used with .Dt was BSD or ATT. An
unrecognized version argument after ATT is replaced with
&ldquo;UNIX&rdquo;; for other predefined abbreviations, it
is ignored and a warning diagnostic emitted. Otherwise,
unrecognized arguments are displayed verbatim in the page
footer. For instance, this page uses &ldquo;.Os groff
1.23.0&rdquo; whereas a locally produced page might employ
&ldquo;.Os "UXYZ CS Department"&rdquo;, omitting
versioning.

Introduction to manual
and general text domains

What&rsquo;s in a
Name... 
The manual domain macro names are derived from the day to
day informal language used to describe commands, subroutines
and related files. Slightly different variations of this
language are used to describe the three different aspects of
writing a man page. First, there is the description of mdoc
macro command usage. Second is the description of a UNIX
command with mdoc macros, and third, the description
of a command to a user in the verbal sense; that is,
discussion of a command in the text of a man
page.

In the
first case, troff macros are themselves a type of command;
the general syntax for a troff command is:

.Xx
argument1 argument2 ...

&rsquo;.Xx&rsquo;
is a macro command, and anything following it are arguments
to be processed. In the second case, the description of a
UNIX command using the manual domain macros is a bit more
involved; a typical Synopsis command line might be
displayed as:

filter
[-flag] &lang;

infile &rang; &lang; 
outfile &rang;

Here,
filter is the command name and the bracketed string
-flag is a flag argument designated as
optional by the option brackets. In mdoc terms,
&lang;

infile &rang; and &lang; 
outfile &rang; are called meta arguments; in this
example, the user has to replace the meta expressions given
in angle brackets with real file names. Note that in this
document meta arguments are used to describe mdoc commands;
in most man pages, meta variables are not specifically
written with angle brackets. The macros that formatted the
above example:

.Nm
filter 
.Op Fl flag 
.Ao Ar infile Ac Ao Ar outfile Ac

In the
third case, discussion of commands and command syntax
includes both examples above, but may add more detail. The
arguments &lang;

infile &rang; and &lang; 
outfile &rang; from the example above might be referred
to as operands or file arguments. Some
command-line argument lists are quite long:

make

[-eiknqrstv]
[-D variable] [-d flags]
[-f makefile] [-I directory]
[-j max_jobs] [variable=value]
[target ...]

Here one
might talk about the command make and qualify the argument,
makefile, as an argument to the flag, -f, or
discuss the optional file operand target. In the
verbal context, such detail can prevent confusion, however
the mdoc package does not have a macro for an argument
to a flag. Instead the &rsquo;Ar&rsquo; argument
macro is used for an operand or file argument like
target as well as an argument to a flag like
variable. The make command line was produced
from:

.Nm make

.Op Fl eiknqrstv 
.Op Fl D Ar variable 
.Op Fl d Ar flags 
.Op Fl f Ar makefile 
.Op Fl I Ar directory 
.Op Fl j Ar max_jobs 
.Op Ar variable Ns = Ns Ar value 
.Bk 
.Op Ar target ... 
.Ek

The
&rsquo;.Bk&rsquo; and &rsquo;.Ek&rsquo; macros are explained
in Keeps.

General
Syntax 
The manual domain and general text domain macros share a
similar syntax with a few minor deviations; most notably,
&rsquo;.Ar&rsquo;, &rsquo;.Fl&rsquo;, &rsquo;.Nm&rsquo;, and
&rsquo;.Pa&rsquo; differ only when called without arguments;
and &rsquo;.Fn&rsquo; and &rsquo;.Xr&rsquo; impose an order
on their argument lists. All manual domain macros are
capable of recognizing and properly handling punctuation,
provided each punctuation character is separated by a
leading space. If a command is given:

.Ar
sptr, ptr),

The
result is:

sptr,
ptr),

The
punctuation is not recognized and all is output in the font
used by &rsquo;.Ar&rsquo;. If the punctuation is separated
by a leading white space:

.Ar sptr
, ptr ) ,

The
result is:

sptr,
ptr),

The
punctuation is now recognized and output in the default font
distinguishing it from the argument strings. To remove the
special meaning from a punctuation character, escape it with
&rsquo;\&&rsquo;.

The
following punctuation characters are recognized by
mdoc:

. , : ;
( 
) [ ] ? !

troff is
limited as a macro language, and has difficulty when
presented with a string containing certain mathematical,
logical, or quotation character sequences:

{+,-,/,*,%,,=,=,==,&,`,',"}

The
problem is that troff may assume it is supposed to actually
perform the operation or evaluation suggested by the
characters. To prevent the accidental evaluation of these
characters, escape them with &rsquo;\&&rsquo;. Typical
syntax is shown in the first manual domain macro displayed
below, &rsquo;.Ad&rsquo;.

Manual
domain

Addresses 
The address macro identifies an address
construct.

Usage:
.Ad &lang;

address &rang; ...

.Ad addr1

addr1

.Ad addr1 .

addr1.

.Ad addr1 , file2

addr1,
file2

.Ad f1 , f2 , f3 :

f1,
f2, f3:

.Ad addr ) ) ,

addr)),

The
default width is 12n.

Author
Name 
The &rsquo;.An&rsquo; macro is used to specify the name of
the author of the item being documented, or the name of the
author of the actual manual page.

Usage:
.An &lang;

author name &rang; ...

.An "Joe
Author"

Joe
Author

.An "Joe
Author" ,

Joe
Author,

.An "Joe
Author" Aq nobody [AT] FreeBSD.org

Joe Author
nobody [AT] FreeBSD.org>

.An "Joe
Author" ) ) ,

Joe
Author)),

The
default width is 12n.

In a
section titled &ldquo;Authors&rdquo;, &rsquo;An&rsquo;
causes a break, allowing each new name to appear on its own
line. If this is not desirable,

.An
-nosplit

call will
turn this off. To turn splitting back on, write

.An
-split

Arguments

The .Ar argument macro may be used whenever an argument is
referenced. If called without arguments,
&rsquo;file ...&rsquo; is output. This places
the ellipsis in italics, which is ugly and incorrect, and
will be noticed on terminals that underline text instead of
using an oblique typeface. We recommend using &rsquo;.Ar
file No ...&rsquo; instead.

Usage:
.Ar [

&lang; 
argument&rang; ] ...

.Ar

file ...

.Ar file No ...

file
...

.Ar file1

file1

.Ar file1 .

file1.

.Ar file1 file2

file1
file2

.Ar f1 f2 f3 :

f1 f2
f3:

.Ar file ) ) ,

file)),

The
default width is 12n.

Configuration
Declaration (Section Four Only) 
The &rsquo;.Cd&rsquo; macro is used to demonstrate a
config(8) declaration for a device interface in a section
four manual.

Usage:
.Cd &lang;

argument &rang; ...

.Cd "device le0 at
scode?"

device
le0 at scode?

In a
section titled &ldquo;Synopsis&rdquo;, &rsquo;Cd&rsquo;
causes a break before and after its arguments.

The
default width is 12n.

Command
Modifiers 
The command modifier is identical to the &rsquo;.Fl&rsquo;
(flag) command with the exception that the &rsquo;.Cm&rsquo;
macro does not assert a dash in front of every argument.
Traditionally flags are marked by the preceding dash,
however, some commands or subsets of commands do not use
them. Command modifiers may also be specified in conjunction
with interactive commands such as editor commands. See
Flags.

The
default width is 10n.

Defined
Variables 
A variable (or constant) that is defined in an include file
is specified by the macro &rsquo;.Dv&rsquo;.

Usage:
.Dv &lang;

defined-variable &rang; ...

.Dv
MAXHOSTNAMELEN

MAXHOSTNAMELEN

.Dv TIOCGPGRP )

TIOCGPGRP)

The
default width is 12n.

Errnos

The &rsquo;.Er&rsquo; errno macro specifies the error return
value for section 2, 3, and 9 library routines. The
second example below shows &rsquo;.Er&rsquo; used with the
&rsquo;.Bq&rsquo; general text domain macro, as it would be
used in a section two manual page.

Usage:
.Er &lang;

errno type &rang; ...

.Er ENOENT

ENOENT

.Er ENOENT ) ;

ENOENT);

.Bq Er ENOTDIR

[ENOTDIR]

The
default width is 17n.

Environment
Variables 
The &rsquo;.Ev&rsquo; macro specifies an environment
variable.

Usage:
.Ev &lang;

argument &rang; ...

.Ev DISPLAY

DISPLAY

.Ev PATH .

PATH.

.Ev PRINTER ) ) ,

PRINTER)),

The
default width is 15n.

Flags

The &rsquo;.Fl&rsquo; macro handles command-line flags. It
prepends a dash, &rsquo;-&rsquo;, to the flag. For
interactive command flags that are not prepended with a
dash, the &rsquo;.Cm&rsquo; (command modifier) macro is
identical, but without the dash.

Usage:
.Fl &lang;

argument &rang; ...

.Fl

-

.Fl cfv

-cfv

.Fl cfv .

-cfv.

.Cm cfv .

cfv.

.Fl s v t

-s -v
-t

.Fl - ,

--,

.Fl xyz ) ,

-xyz),

.Fl |

-
|

The
&rsquo;.Fl&rsquo; macro without any arguments results in a
dash representing stdin/stdout. Note that giving
&rsquo;.Fl&rsquo; a single dash will result in two
dashes.

The
default width is 12n.

Function
Declarations 
The &rsquo;.Fd&rsquo; macro is used in the Synopsis
section with section two or three functions. It is neither
callable nor parsed.

Usage:
.Fd &lang;

argument &rang; ...

.Fd "#include
"

#include

In a
section titled &ldquo;Synopsis&rdquo;, &rsquo;Fd&rsquo;
causes a break if a function has already been presented and
a break has not occurred, leaving vertical space between one
function declaration and the next.

In a
section titled &ldquo;Synopsis&rdquo;, the &rsquo;In&rsquo;
macro represents the #include statement, and is the short
form of the above example. It specifies the C header
file as being included in a C program. It also causes a
break.

While not
in the &ldquo;Synopsis&rdquo; section, it represents the
header file enclosed in angle brackets.

Usage:
.In &lang;

header file &rang;

.In stdio.h

stdio.h>

.In stdio.h

stdio.h>

Function
Types 
This macro is intended for the &ldquo;Synopsis&rdquo;
section. It may be used anywhere else in the man page
without problems, but its main purpose is to present the
function type (in BSD kernel normal form) for the
&ldquo;Synopsis&rdquo; of sections two and three. (It causes
a break, allowing the function name to appear on the next
line.)

Usage:
.Ft &lang;

type &rang; ...

.Ft struct
stat

struct
stat

Functions
(Library Routines) 
The &rsquo;.Fn&rsquo; macro is modeled on ANSI C
conventions.

Usage:
.Fn &lang;

function &rang; [ 
&lang; 
parameter&rang; ] ...

.Fn getchar

getchar()

.Fn strlen ) ,

strlen()),

.Fn align "char *ptr" ,

align(char
*ptr),

Note that
any call to another macro signals the end of the
&rsquo;.Fn&rsquo; call (it will insert a closing parenthesis
at that point).

For
functions with many parameters (which is rare), the macros
&rsquo;.Fo&rsquo; (function open) and &rsquo;.Fc&rsquo;
(function close) may be used with &rsquo;.Fa&rsquo;
(function argument).

Example:

.Ft int

.Fo res_mkquery 
.Fa "int op" 
.Fa "char *dname" 
.Fa "int class" 
.Fa "int type" 
.Fa "char *data" 
.Fa "int datalen" 
.Fa "struct rrec *newrr" 
.Fa "char *buf" 
.Fa "int buflen" 
.Fc

Produces:

int

res_mkquery(int op,
char *dname, int class,
int type, char *data,
int datalen,
struct rrec *newrr, char *buf,
int buflen)

Typically,
in a &ldquo;Synopsis&rdquo; section, the function
delcaration will begin the line. If more than one function
is presented in the &ldquo;Synopsis&rdquo; section and a
function type has not been given, a break will occur,
leaving vertical space between the current and prior
function names.

The
default width values of &rsquo;.Fn&rsquo; and
&rsquo;.Fo&rsquo; are 12n and 16n, respectively.

Function
Arguments 
The &rsquo;.Fa&rsquo; macro is used to refer to function
arguments (parameters) outside of the Synopsis
section of the manual or inside the Synopsis section
if the enclosure macros &rsquo;.Fo&rsquo; and
&rsquo;.Fc&rsquo; instead of &rsquo;.Fn&rsquo; are used.
&rsquo;.Fa&rsquo; may also be used to refer to structure
members.

Usage:
.Fa &lang;

function argument &rang; ...

.Fa d_namlen ) )
,

d_namlen)),

.Fa iov_len

iov_len

The
default width is 12n.

Return
Values 
The &rsquo;.Rv&rsquo; macro generates text for use in the
Return values section.

Usage:
.Rv [

-std ] [&lang; 
function &rang; ...]

For
example, &rsquo;.Rv -std atexit&rsquo; produces:

The
atexit() function returns the value 0 if
successful; otherwise the value -1 is returned and the
global variable errno is set to indicate the
error.

The
-std option is valid only for manual page
sections 2 and 3. Currently, this macro does
nothing if used without the -std flag.

Exit
Status 
The &rsquo;.Ex&rsquo; macro generates text for use in the
Diagnostics section.

Usage:
.Ex [

-std ] [&lang; 
utility &rang; ...]

For
example, &rsquo;.Ex -std cat&rsquo; produces:

The
cat utility exits 0 on success, and >0
if an error occurs.

The
-std option is valid only for manual page sections 1,
6 and 8. Currently, this macro does nothing if used
without the -std flag.

Interactive
Commands 
The &rsquo;.Ic&rsquo; macro designates an interactive or
internal command.

Usage:
.Ic &lang;

argument &rang; ...

.Ic :wq

:wq

.Ic "do while {...}"

do
while {...}

.Ic setenv , unsetenv

setenv,
unsetenv

The
default width is 12n.

Library
Names 
The &rsquo;.Lb&rsquo; macro is used to specify the library
where a particular function is compiled in.

Usage:
.Lb &lang;

argument &rang; ...

In a
section titled &ldquo;Library&rdquo;, &rsquo;Lb&rsquo;
causes a break before and after its arguments.

Literals

The &rsquo;Li&rsquo; literal macro may be used for special
characters, symbolic constants, and other syntactical items
that should be typed exactly as displayed.

Usage:
.Li &lang;

argument &rang; ...

.Li \en

\n

.Li M1 M2 M3 ;

M1 M2
M3;

.Li cntrl-D ) ,

cntrl-D),

.Li 1024 ...

1024
...

The
default width is 16n.

Names

The &rsquo;Nm&rsquo; macro is used for the document title or
page topic. Upon its first call, it has the peculiarity of
remembering its argument, which should always be the topic
of the man page. When subsequently called without arguments,
&rsquo;Nm&rsquo; regurgitates this initial name for the sole
purpose of making less work for the author. Use of
&rsquo;Nm&rsquo; is also appropriate when presenting a
command synopsis for the topic of a man page in section 1,
6, or 8. Its behavior changes when presented with arguments
of various forms.

.Nm
groff_mdoc

groff_mdoc

.Nm

groff_mdoc

.Nm \-mdoc

-mdoc

.Nm foo ) ) ,

foo)),

.Nm :

groff_mdoc:

By
default, the topic is set in boldface to reflect its prime
importance in the discussion. Cross references to other man
page topics should use &rsquo;Xr&rsquo;; including a second
argument for the section number enables them to be
hyperlinked. By default, cross-referenced topics are set in
italics to avoid cluttering the page with
boldface.

The
default width is 10n.

Options

The &rsquo;.Op&rsquo; macro places option brackets around
any remaining arguments on the command line, and places any
trailing punctuation outside the brackets. The macros
&rsquo;.Oo&rsquo; and &rsquo;.Oc&rsquo; (which produce an
opening and a closing option bracket, respectively) may be
used across one or more lines or to specify the exact
position of the closing parenthesis.

Usage:
.Op [

&lang; 
option&rang; ] ...

.Op

.Op Fl k

[-k]

.Op Fl k ) .

.Op Fl k Ar kookfile

[-k

.Li .Op Oo Ao option Ac Oc ...

.Op

&lang; 
option&rang; ] ...

Here a
typical example of the &rsquo;.Oo&rsquo; and
&rsquo;.Oc&rsquo; macros:

.Oo 
.Op Fl k Ar kilobytes 
.Op Fl i Ar interval 
.Op Fl c Ar count 
.Oc

Produces:

[

[-k kilobytes] [-i
interval] [-c count] ]

The
default width values of &rsquo;.Op&rsquo; and
&rsquo;.Oo&rsquo; are 14n and 10n, respectively.

Pathnames

The &rsquo;.Pa&rsquo; macro formats file specifications. If
called without arguments, &rsquo;~&rsquo; (recognized
by many shells) is output, representing the user&rsquo;s
home directory.

Usage:
.Pa [

&lang; 
pathname&rang; ] ...

.Pa

~

.Pa /usr/share

/usr/share

.Pa /tmp/fooXXXXX ) .

/tmp/fooXXXXX).

The
default width is 32n.

Standards

The &rsquo;.St&rsquo; macro replaces standard abbreviations
with their formal names.

Usage:
.St &lang;

Font
Mode 
The &rsquo;.Bf&rsquo; font mode must be ended with the
&rsquo;.Ef&rsquo; macro (the latter takes no arguments).
Font modes may be nested within other font
modes.

&rsquo;.Bf&rsquo;
has the following syntax:

.Bf
&lang;

font mode &rang;

&lang;

font mode &rang; must be one of the following
three types:

Em |
-emphasis

Same as
if the &rsquo;.Em&rsquo; macro was used for the entire block
of text.

Li | -literal

Same as
if the &rsquo;.Li&rsquo; macro was used for the entire block
of text.

Sy | -symbolic

Same as
if the &rsquo;.Sy&rsquo; macro was used for the entire block
of text.

Both
macros are neither callable nor parsed.

Enclosure
and Quoting Macros 
The concept of enclosure is similar to quoting. The object
being to enclose one or more strings between a pair of
characters like quotes or parentheses. The terms quoting and
enclosure are used interchangeably throughout this document.
Most of the one-line enclosure macros end in small letter
&rsquo;q&rsquo; to give a hint of quoting, but there are a
few irregularities. For each enclosure macro, there is a
pair of opening and closing macros that end with the
lowercase letters &rsquo;o&rsquo; and &rsquo;c&rsquo;
respectively.

All
macros ending with &rsquo;q&rsquo; and &rsquo;o&rsquo; have
a default width value of 12n.

.Eo, .Ec

These
macros expect the first argument to be the opening and
closing strings, respectively.

.Es, .En

To work
around the nine-argument limit in the original troff
program, mdoc supports two other macros that are now
obsolete. &rsquo;.Es&rsquo; uses its first and second
parameters as opening and closing marks which are then used
to enclose the arguments of &rsquo;.En&rsquo;. The default
width value is 12n for both macros.

.Eq

The
first and second arguments of this macro are the opening and
closing strings respectively, followed by the arguments to
be enclosed.

.Ql

The
quoted literal macro behaves differently in troff and nroff
modes. If formatted with nroff(1), a quoted literal is
always quoted. If formatted with troff, an item is only
quoted if the width of the item is less than three
constant-width characters. This is to make short strings
more visible where the font change to literal
(constant-width) is less noticeable.

The
default width is 16n.

.Pf

The
prefix macro suppresses the whitespace between its first and
second argument:

.Pf ( Fa
name2

(name2

The
default width is 12n.

The
&rsquo;.Ns&rsquo; macro (see below) performs the analogous
suffix function.

.Ap

The
&rsquo;.Ap&rsquo; macro inserts an apostrophe and exits any
special text modes, continuing in &rsquo;.No&rsquo;
mode.

Examples
of quoting:

.Aq

&lang;
&rang;

.Aq Pa ctype.h ) ,

&lang;
ctype.h&rang; ),

.Bq

[]

.Bq Em Greek , French .

.Qq string Ns ),

.Em or Ap ing

or&rsquo;ing

For a
good example of nested enclosure macros, see the
&rsquo;.Op&rsquo; option macro. It was created from the same
underlying enclosure macros as those presented in the list
above. The &rsquo;.Xo&rsquo; and &rsquo;.Xc&rsquo; extended
argument list macros are discussed below.

Normal
text macro 
&rsquo;No&rsquo; formats subsequent argument(s) normally,
ending the effect of &rsquo;Em&rsquo; and similar. Parsing
is not suppressed, so you must prefix words like
&rsquo;No&rsquo; with &rsquo;\&&rsquo; to avoid their
interpretation as mdoc macros.

Usage:
.No argument ...

.Em Use caution No here
.

&rarr;
Use caution here.

.Em No dogs allowed .

&rarr;
No dogs allowed.

.Em \&No dogs allowed .

&rarr;
No dogs allowed.

The
default width is 12n.

No-Space
Macro 
The &rsquo;.Ns&rsquo; macro suppresses insertion of a space
between the current position and its first parameter. For
example, it is useful for old style argument lists where
there is no space between the flag and argument:

Usage:
... &lang;

argument &rang; Ns [ 
&lang; 
argument&rang; ] ...

.Ns &lang;

argument &rang; ...

.Op Fl I Ns Ar
directory

[-Idirectory]

Note: The
&rsquo;.Ns&rsquo; macro always invokes the &rsquo;.No&rsquo;
macro after eliminating the space unless another macro name
follows it. If used as a command (i.e., the second form
above in the &rsquo;Usage&rsquo; line), &rsquo;.Ns&rsquo; is
identical to &rsquo;.No&rsquo;.

(Sub)section
cross references 
Use the &rsquo;.Sx&rsquo; macro to cite a (sub)section
heading within the given document.

Usage:
.Sx &lang;

section-reference &rang; ...

.Sx Files

&rarr;
Files

The
default width is 16n.

Symbolics

The symbolic emphasis macro is generally a boldface macro in
either the symbolic sense or the traditional English
usage.

Usage:
.Sy &lang;

symbol &rang; ...

.Sy Important
Notice

&rarr;
Important Notice

The
default width is 6n.

Mathematical
Symbols 
Use this macro for mathematical symbols and similar
things.

Usage:
.Ms &lang;

math symbol &rang; ...

.Ms sigma

&rarr;
sigma

The
default width is 6n.

References
and Citations 
The following macros make a modest attempt to handle
references. At best, the macros make it convenient to
manually drop in a subset of refer(1) style
references.

.Rs

Reference
start (does not take arguments). In a section titled
&ldquo;See also&rdquo;, it causes a break and begins
collection of reference information until the reference end
macro is read.

.Re

Reference
end (does not take arguments). The reference is
printed.

.%A

Reference
author name; one name per invocation.

.%B

Book
title.

.%C

City/place.

.%D

Date.

.%I

Issuer/publisher
name.

.%J

Journal
name.

.%N

Issue
number.

.%O

Optional

.%P

Page

.%Q

Corporate
or foreign author.

.%R

Report
name.

.%T

Title of
article.

.%U

Optional
hypertext reference.

.%V

Volume.

Macros
beginning with &rsquo;%&rsquo; are not callable but accept
multiple arguments in the usual way. Only the
&rsquo;.Tn&rsquo; macro is handled properly as a parameter;
other macros will cause strange output. &rsquo;.%B&rsquo;
and &rsquo;.%T&rsquo; can be used outside of the
&rsquo;.Rs/.Re&rsquo; environment.

Example:

.Rs 
.%A "Matthew Bar" 
.%A "John Foo" 
.%T "Implementation Notes on foobar(1)" 
.%R "Technical Report ABC-DE-12-345" 
.%Q "Drofnats College" 
.%C "Nowhere" 
.%D "April 1991" 
.Re

produces

Matthew Bar

and

John Foo , 
Implementation Notes on foobar(1) , 
Technical Report ABC-DE-12-345 , 
Drofnats College , 
Nowhere , 
April 1991 .

Trade
Names or Acronyms 
The trade name macro prints its arguments at a smaller type
size. It is intended to imitate a small caps fonts for fully
capitalized acronyms.

Usage:
.Tn &lang;

symbol &rang; ...

.Tn DEC

DEC

.Tn ASCII

ASCII

The
default width is 10n.

Extended
Arguments 
The .Xo and .Xc macros allow one to extend an argument list
on a macro boundary for the &rsquo;.It&rsquo; macro (see
below). Note that .Xo and .Xc are implemented similarly to
all other macros opening and closing an enclosure (without
inserting characters, of course). This means that the
following is true for those macros also.

Here is
an example of &rsquo;.Xo&rsquo; using the space mode macro
to turn spacing off:

.Bd
-literal -offset indent 
.Sm off 
.It Xo Sy I Ar operation 
.No \en Ar count No \en 
.Xc 
.Sm on 
.Ed

produces

Ioperation\ncount\n

Another
one:

.Bd
-literal -offset indent 
.Sm off 
.It Cm S No / Ar old_pattern Xo 
.No / Ar new_pattern 
.No / Op Cm g 
.Xc 
.Sm on 
.Ed

produces

S/old_pattern

/new_pattern/[g]

Another
example of &rsquo;.Xo&rsquo; and enclosure macros: Test the
value of a variable.

.Bd
-literal -offset indent 
.It Xo 
.Ic .ifndef 
.Oo \&! Oc Ns Ar variable Oo 
.Ar operator variable No ... 
.Oc Xc 
.Ed

produces

.ifndef [ 
!]variable [ 
operator variable ...]

Page structure
domain

Section headings

The following &rsquo;.Sh&rsquo; section heading macros are
required in every man page. The remaining section headings
are recommended at the discretion of the author writing the
manual page. The &rsquo;.Sh&rsquo; macro is parsed but not
generally callable. It can be used as an argument in a call
to &rsquo;.Sh&rsquo; only; it then reactivates the default
font for &rsquo;.Sh&rsquo;.

The
default width is 8n.

.Sh Name

The
&rsquo;.Sh Name&rsquo; macro is mandatory. If not specified,
headers, footers, and page layout defaults will not be set
and things will be rather unpleasant. The Name
section consists of at least three items. The first is the
&rsquo;.Nm&rsquo; name macro naming the subject of the man
page. The second is the name description macro,
&rsquo;.Nd&rsquo;, which separates the subject name from the
third item, which is the description. The description should
be the most terse and lucid possible, as the space available
is small.

&rsquo;.Nd&rsquo;
first prints &rsquo;-&rsquo;, then all its
arguments.

.Sh Library

This
section is for section two and three function calls. It
should consist of a single &rsquo;.Lb&rsquo; macro call; see
Library Names.

.Sh Synopsis

The
Synopsis section describes the typical usage of the
subject of a man page. The macros required are either
&rsquo;.Nm&rsquo;, &rsquo;.Cd&rsquo;, or &rsquo;.Fn&rsquo;
(and possibly &rsquo;.Fo&rsquo;, &rsquo;.Fc&rsquo;,
&rsquo;.Fd&rsquo;, and &rsquo;.Ft&rsquo;). The function name
macro &rsquo;.Fn&rsquo; is required for manual page
sections 2 and 3; the command and general name
macro &rsquo;.Nm&rsquo; is required for sections 1, 5, 6, 7,
and 8. Section 4 manuals require a
&rsquo;.Nm&rsquo;, &rsquo;.Fd&rsquo; or a &rsquo;.Cd&rsquo;
configuration device usage macro. Several other macros may
be necessary to produce the synopsis line as shown
below:

cat
[-benstuv] [-] file ...

The
following macros were used:

.Nm cat

.Op Fl benstuv 
.Op Fl 
.Ar file No ...

.Sh
Description

In most
cases the first text in the Description section is a
brief paragraph on the command, function or file, followed
by a lexical list of options and respective explanations. To
create such a list, the &rsquo;.Bl&rsquo; (begin list),
&rsquo;.It&rsquo; (list item) and &rsquo;.El&rsquo; (end
list) macros are used (see Lists and Columns
below).

.Sh Implementation
notes

Implementation specific
information should be placed here.

.Sh Return
values

Sections
2, 3 and 9 function return values should go here. The
&rsquo;.Rv&rsquo; macro may be used to generate text for use
in the Return values section for most section 2 and 3
library functions; see Return Values.

The
following &rsquo;.Sh&rsquo; section headings are part of the
preferred manual page layout and must be used appropriately
to maintain consistency. They are listed in the order in
which they would be used.

.Sh
Environment

The
Environment section should reveal any related
environment variables and clues to their behavior and/or
usage.

.Sh Files

Files
which are used or created by the man page subject should be
listed via the &rsquo;.Pa&rsquo; macro in the Files
section.

.Sh Examples

There
are several ways to create examples. See subsection
Examples and Displays below for details.

.Sh
Diagnostics

Diagnostic
messages from a command should be placed in this section.
The &rsquo;.Ex&rsquo; macro may be used to generate text for
use in the Diagnostics section for most section 1, 6
and 8 commands; see Exit Status.

.Sh
Compatibility

Known
compatibility issues (e.g. deprecated options or parameters)
should be listed here.

.Sh Errors

Specific
error handling, especially from library functions (man page
sections 2, 3, and 9) should go here. The
&rsquo;.Er&rsquo; macro is used to specify an error
(errno).

.Sh See also

References
to other material on the man page topic and cross references
to other relevant man pages should be placed in the See
also section. Cross references are specified using the
&rsquo;.Xr&rsquo; macro. Currently refer(1) style references
are not accommodated.

It is
recommended that the cross references be sorted by section
number, then alphabetically by name within each section,
then separated by commas. Example:

ls(1),
ps(1), group(5), passwd(5)

.Sh Standards

If the
command, library function, or file adheres to a specific
implementation such as IEEE Std 1003.2
(&ldquo;POSIX.2&rdquo;) or ANSI X3.159-1989
(&ldquo;ANSI C89&rdquo;) this should be noted here. If
the command does not adhere to any standard, its history
should be noted in the History section.

.Sh History

Any
command which does not adhere to any specific standards
should be outlined historically in this section.

.Sh Authors

Credits
should be placed here. Use the &rsquo;.An&rsquo; macro for
names and the &rsquo;.Aq&rsquo; macro for email addresses
within optional contact information. Explicitly indicate
whether the person authored the initial manual page or the
software or whatever the person is being credited
for.

.Sh Bugs

Blatant
problems with the topic go here.

User-specified
&rsquo;.Sh&rsquo; sections may be added; for example, this
section was set with:

.Sh
"Page structure domain"

Subsection
headings 
Subsection headings have exactly the same syntax as section
headings: &rsquo;.Ss&rsquo; is parsed but not generally
callable. It can be used as an argument in a call to
&rsquo;.Ss&rsquo; only; it then reactivates the default font
for &rsquo;.Ss&rsquo;.

The
default width is 8n.

Paragraphs
and Line Spacing

.Pp

The
&rsquo;.Pp&rsquo; paragraph command may be used to specify a
line space where necessary. The macro is not necessary after
a &rsquo;.Sh&rsquo; or &rsquo;.Ss&rsquo; macro or before a
&rsquo;.Bl&rsquo; or &rsquo;.Bd&rsquo; macro (which both
assert a vertical distance unless the -compact flag
is given).

The
macro is neither callable nor parsed and takes no arguments;
an alternative name is &rsquo;.Lp&rsquo;.

Keeps

The only keep that is implemented at this time is for words.
The macros are &rsquo;.Bk&rsquo; (begin keep) and
&rsquo;.Ek&rsquo; (end keep). The only option that
&rsquo;.Bk&rsquo; currently accepts is -words (also
the default); this prevents breaks in the middle of options.
In the example for make command-line arguments (see
What&rsquo;s in a Name), the keep prevents nroff from
placing the flag and the argument on separate
lines.

Neither
macro is callable or parsed.

More work
needs to be done on the keep macros; specifically, a
-line option should be added.

Examples
and Displays 
There are seven types of displays.

.D1

(This is
D-one.) Display one line of indented text. This macro is
parsed but not callable.

-ldghfstru

The
above was produced by: .D1 Fl ldghfstru.

.Dl

(This is
D-ell.) Display one line of indented literal text.
The &rsquo;.Dl&rsquo; example macro has been used throughout
this file. It allows the indentation (display) of one line
of text. Its default font is set to constant width
(literal). &rsquo;.Dl&rsquo; is parsed but not
callable.

% ls
-ldg /usr/local/bin

The
above was produced by: .Dl % ls \-ldg
/usr/local/bin.

.Bd

Begin
display. The &rsquo;.Bd&rsquo; display must be ended with
the &rsquo;.Ed&rsquo; macro. It has the following
syntax:

.Bd 
{ 
-literal | -filled | -unfilled | -ragged | -centered} [ 
-offset &lang; 
string&rang; ] [ 
-file &lang; 
file name&rang; ] [ 
-compact]

-ragged

Fill,
but do not adjust the right margin (only
left-justify).

-centered

Center
lines between the current left and right margin. Note that
each single line is centered.

-unfilled

Do not
fill; break lines where their input lines are broken. This
can produce overlong lines without warning
messages.

-filled

Display
a filled block. The block of text is formatted (i.e., the
text is justified on both the left and right
side).

-literal

Display
block with literal font (usually fixed-width). Useful for
source code or simple tabbed or spaced text.

-file &lang; 
file name&rang;

The file
whose name follows the -file flag is read and
displayed before any data enclosed with &rsquo;.Bd&rsquo;
and &rsquo;.Ed&rsquo;, using the selected display type. Any
troff/mdoc commands in the file will be
processed.

-offset &lang; 
string&rang;

If
-offset is specified with one of the following
strings, the string is interpreted to indicate the level of
indentation for the forthcoming block of text:

left

Align
block on the current left margin; this is the default mode
of &rsquo;.Bd&rsquo;.

center

Supposedly
center the block. At this time unfortunately, the block
merely gets left aligned about an imaginary center
margin.

indent

Indent
by one default indent value or tab. The default indent value
is also used for the &rsquo;.D1&rsquo; and &rsquo;.Dl&rsquo;
macros, so one is guaranteed the two types of displays will
line up. The indentation value is normally set to 6n or
about two thirds of an inch (six constant width
characters).

indent-two

Indent
two times the default indent value.

right

This
left aligns the block about two inches from the right
side of the page. This macro needs work and perhaps may
never do the right thing within troff.

If
&lang;

string &rang; is a valid numeric expression
instead (with a scaling indicator other than
&rsquo;u&rsquo;), use that value for indentation. The
most useful scaling indicators are &rsquo;m&rsquo; and
&rsquo;n&rsquo;, specifying the so-called Em and
En square. This is approximately the width of the
letters &rsquo;m&rsquo; and &rsquo;n&rsquo; respectively of
the current font (for nroff output, both scaling indicators
give the same values). If &lang; 
string &rang; isn&rsquo;t a numeric expression, it is tested
whether it is an mdoc macro name, and the default offset
value associated with this macro is used. Finally, if all
tests fail, the width of &lang; 
string &rang; (typeset with a fixed-width font) is taken as
the offset. 
-compact

Suppress
insertion of vertical space before begin of
display.

.Ed

End
display (takes no arguments).

Lists
and Columns 
There are several types of lists which may be initiated with
the &rsquo;.Bl&rsquo; begin-list macro. Items within the
list are specified with the &rsquo;.It&rsquo; item macro,
and each list must end with the &rsquo;.El&rsquo; macro.
Lists may be nested within themselves and within displays.
The use of columns inside of lists or lists inside of
columns is untested.

In
addition, several list attributes may be specified such as
the width of a tag, the list offset, and compactness (blank
lines between items allowed or disallowed). Most of this
document has been formatted with a tag style list
(-tag).

It has
the following syntax forms:

.Bl 
{ 
-hang | -ohang | -tag | -diag | -inset} [ 
-width &lang; 
string&rang; ] [ 
-offset &lang; 
string&rang; ] [ 
-compact] 
.Bl 
-column [ 
-offset &lang; 
string&rang; ] &lang; 
string1&rang; &lang; 
string2&rang; ... 
.Bl 
{ 
-item | -enum [ 
-nested] | -bullet | -hyphen | -dash} [ 
-offset &lang; 
string&rang; ] [ 
-compact]

And now a
detailed description of the list types.

-bullet

A bullet
list.

.Bl
-bullet -offset indent -compact 
.It 
Bullet one goes here. 
.It 
Bullet two here. 
.El

Produces:

&bull;

Bullet one goes
here.

&bull;

Bullet two
here.

-dash (or
-hyphen)

A dash list.

.Bl
-dash -offset indent -compact 
.It 
Dash one goes here. 
.It 
Dash two here. 
.El

Produces:

-

Dash one goes
here.

-

Dash two
here.

-enum

An
enumerated list.

.Bl
-enum -offset indent -compact 
.It 
Item one goes here. 
.It 
And item two here. 
.El

The
result:

1.

Item one goes
here.

2.

And item two
here.

If you
want to nest enumerated lists, use the -nested flag
(starting with the second-level list):

.Bl
-enum -offset indent -compact 
.It 
Item one goes here 
.Bl -enum -nested -compact 
.It 
Item two goes here. 
.It 
And item three here. 
.El 
.It 
And item four here. 
.El

Result:

1.

Item one goes
here.

1.1.

Item two goes
here.

1.2.

And item three
here.

2.

And item four
here.

-item

A list
of type -item without list markers.

.Bl
-item -offset indent 
.It 
Item one goes here. 
Item one goes here. 
Item one goes here. 
.It 
Item two here. 
Item two here. 
Item two here. 
.El

Produces:

Item one
goes here. Item one goes here. Item one goes
here.

Item two
here. Item two here. Item two here.

-tag

A list
with tags. Use -width to specify the tag
width.

SL

sleep
time of the process (seconds blocked)

PAGEIN

number of disk I/O
operations resulting from references by the process to pages
not loaded in core.

UID

numerical
user-id of process owner

PPID

numerical
id of parent of process priority (non-positive when in
non-interruptible wait)

The raw
text:

.Bl -tag
-width "PPID" -compact -offset indent 
.It SL 
sleep time of the process (seconds blocked) 
.It PAGEIN

.It UID 
numerical user-id of process owner 
.It PPID 
numerical id of parent of process priority 
(non-positive when in non-interruptible wait) 
.El

-diag

Diag
lists create section four diagnostic lists and are similar
to inset lists except callable macros are ignored. The
-width flag is not meaningful in this
context.

Example:

.Bl
-diag 
.It You can&rsquo;t use Sy here. 
The message says all. 
.El

produces

You
can&rsquo;t use Sy here.  The message says
all.

-hang

A list
with hanging tags.

Hanged

labels appear similar to
tagged lists when the label is smaller than the label
width.

Longer hanged list
labels

blend into the paragraph
unlike tagged paragraph labels.

And the
unformatted text which created it:

.Bl
-hang -offset indent 
.It Em Hanged 
labels appear similar to tagged lists when the 
label is smaller than the label width. 
.It Em Longer hanged list labels 
blend into the paragraph unlike 
tagged paragraph labels. 
.El

-ohang

Lists
with overhanging tags do not use indentation for the items;
tags are written to a separate line.

SL

sleep time of the
process (seconds blocked)

PAGEIN

number of disk I/O
operations resulting from references by the process to pages
not loaded in core.

UID

numerical user-id of

Tag

The tagged list (also
called a tagged paragraph) is the most common type of list
used in the Berkeley manuals. Use a -width attribute
as described below.

Diag

Diag lists create
section four diagnostic lists and are similar to inset lists
except callable macros are ignored.

Hang

Hanged labels are a
matter of taste.

Ohang

Overhanging labels are
nice when space is constrained.

Inset

Inset labels are useful
for controlling blocks of paragraphs and are valuable for
converting mdoc manuals to other formats.

Here is
the source text which produced the above
example:

.Bl
-inset -offset indent 
.It Em Tag

-column

This
list type generates multiple columns. The number of columns
and the width of each column is determined by the arguments
to the -column list, &lang; string1&rang; ,
&lang; string2&rang; , etc. If &lang;
stringN&rang; starts with a &rsquo;.&rsquo; (dot)
immediately followed by a valid mdoc macro name, interpret
&lang; stringN&rang; and use the width of the result.
Otherwise, the width of &lang; stringN&rang; (typeset
with a fixed-width font) is taken as the Nth column
width.

Each
&rsquo;.It&rsquo; argument is parsed to make a row, each
column within the row is a separate argument separated by a
tab or the &rsquo;.Ta&rsquo; macro.

The
table:

String
Nroff Troff 

>= >= &ge;

was
produced by:

.Bl
-column -offset indent ".Sy String" ".Sy
Nroff" ".Sy Troff" 
.It Sy String Ta Sy Nroff Ta Sy Troff 
.It Li 
.It Li >= Ta >= Ta \*(>= 
.El

Don&rsquo;t
abuse this list type! For more complicated cases it might be
far better and easier to use tbl(1), the table
preprocessor.

Other
keywords:

-width &lang;

string&rang;

If
&lang; string&rang; starts with a &rsquo;.&rsquo;
(dot) immediately followed by a valid mdoc macro name,
interpret &lang; string&rang; and use the width of
the result. Almost all lists in this document use this
option.

Example:

.Bl -tag
-width ".Fl test Ao Ar string Ac" 
.It Fl test Ao Ar string Ac 
This is a longer sentence to show how the 
.Fl width 
flag works in combination with a tag list. 
.El

gives:

-test &lang;

string&rang;

This is
a longer sentence to show how the -width flag works
in combination with a tag list.

(Note
that the current state of mdoc is saved before &lang;
string&rang; is interpreted; afterwards, all
variables are restored again. However, boxes (used for
enclosures) can&rsquo;t be saved in GNU troff(1); as a
consequence, arguments must always be balanced to
avoid nasty errors. For example, do not write &rsquo;.Ao Ar
string&rsquo; but &rsquo;.Ao Ar string Xc&rsquo; instead if
you really need only an opening angle bracket.)

Otherwise,
if &lang; string&rang; is a valid numeric expression
(with a scaling indicator other than
&rsquo;u&rsquo;), use that value for indentation. The
most useful scaling indicators are &rsquo;m&rsquo; and
&rsquo;n&rsquo;, specifying the so-called Em and
En square. This is approximately the width of the
letters &rsquo;m&rsquo; and &rsquo;n&rsquo; respectively of
the current font (for nroff output, both scaling indicators
give the same values). If &lang; string&rang;
isn&rsquo;t a numeric expression, it is tested whether it is
an mdoc macro name, and the default width value associated
with this macro is used. Finally, if all tests fail, the
width of &lang; string&rang; (typeset with a
fixed-width font) is taken as the width.

If a
width is not specified for the tag list type,
&rsquo;6n&rsquo; is used.

-offset &lang;

string&rang;

If
&lang; string&rang; is indent, a default
indent value (normally set to 6n, similar to the value
used in &rsquo;.Dl&rsquo; or &rsquo;.Bd&rsquo;) is used. If
&lang; string&rang; is a valid numeric expression
instead (with a scaling indicator other than
&rsquo;u&rsquo;), use that value for indentation. The
most useful scaling indicators are &rsquo;m&rsquo; and
&rsquo;n&rsquo;, specifying the so-called Em and
En square. This is approximately the width of the
letters &rsquo;m&rsquo; and &rsquo;n&rsquo; respectively of
the current font (for nroff output, both scaling indicators
give the same values). If &lang; string&rang;
isn&rsquo;t a numeric expression, it is tested whether it is
an mdoc macro name, and the default offset value associated
with this macro is used. Finally, if all tests fail, the
width of &lang; string&rang; (typeset with a
fixed-width font) is taken as the offset.

-compact

Suppress
insertion of vertical space before the list and between list
items.

Miscellaneous
macros

A double handful of
macros fit only uncomfortably into one of the above
sections. Of these, we couldn&rsquo;t find attested examples
for &rsquo;Me&rsquo; or &rsquo;Ot&rsquo;. They are
documented here for completeness&mdash;if you know their
proper usage, please send a mail to groff [AT] gnu.org and
include a specimen with its provenance.

.Bt

formats
boilerplate text.

.Bt

&rarr;
is currently in beta test.

It is
neither callable nor parsed and takes no arguments. Its
default width is 6n.

.Fr

is an
obsolete means of specifying a function return
value.

Usage:
.Fr return-value ...

&rsquo;Fr&rsquo;
allows a break right before the return value (usually a
single digit) which is bad typographical behaviour. Instead,
set the return value with the rest of the code, using
&rsquo;\~&rsquo; to tie the return value to the previous
word.

Its
default width is 12n.

.Hf

Inlines
the contents of a (header) file into the
document.

Usage:
.Hf file

It first
prints &rsquo;File:&rsquo; followed by the file name, then
the contents of file. It is neither callable nor
parsed.

.Lk

Embed
hyperlink.

Usage:
.Lk uri [link-text]

Its
default width is 6n.

.Me

Usage
unknown. The mdoc sources describe it as a macro for
&ldquo;menu entries&rdquo;.

Its
default width is 6n.

.Mt

Embed
email address.

Usage:
.Mt email-address

Its
default width is 6n.

.Ot

Usage
unknown. The mdoc sources describe it as &ldquo;old function
type (fortran)&rdquo;.

.Sm

Manipulate
or toggle argument-spacing mode.

Usage:
.Sm [

on | off ] ...

If
argument-spacing mode is off, no spaces between macro
arguments are inserted. If called without a parameter (or if
the next parameter is neither &rsquo;on&rsquo; nor
&rsquo;off&rsquo;), &rsquo;Sm&rsquo; toggles
argument-spacing mode.

Its
default width is 8n.

.Ud

formats
boilerplate text.

.Ud

&rarr;
currently under development.

It is
neither callable nor parsed and takes no arguments. Its
default width is 8n.

Predefined
strings

The following strings are
predefined for compatibility with legacy mdoc documents.
Contemporary ones should use the alternatives shown in the
&ldquo;Prefer&rdquo; column below. See groff_char(7) for a
full discussion of these special character escape
sequences.

Some
column headings are shorthand for standardized character
encodings; &ldquo;7-bit&rdquo; for ISO 646:1991 IRV
(US-ASCII), &ldquo;8-bit&rdquo; for ISO 8859-1 (Latin-1) and
IBM code page 1047, and &ldquo;UCS&rdquo; for ISO 10646
(Unicode character set). Historically, mdoc configured the
string definitions to fit the capabilities expected of the
output device. Old typesetters lacked directional double
quotes, producing repeated directional single quotes
&rsquo;&rsquo;like this&rsquo;&rsquo;; early versions of
mdoc in fact defined the &rsquo;Lq&rsquo; and
&rsquo;Rq&rsquo; strings this way. Nowadays, output drivers
take on the responsibility of glyph substitution, as they
possess relevant knowledge of their available
repertoires.

Diagnostics

The debugging macro
&rsquo;.Db&rsquo; offered by previous versions of mdoc is
unavailable in GNU troff(1) since the latter provides better
facilities to check parameters; additionally, groff mdoc
implements many error and warning messages, making the
package more robust and more verbose.

The
remaining debugging macro is &rsquo;.Rd&rsquo;, which dumps
the package&rsquo;s global register and string contents to
the standard error stream. A normal user will never need
it.

Options

The following groff
options set registers (with -r) and strings (with
-d) recognized and used by the mdoc macro package. To
ensure rendering consistent with output device capabilities
and reader preferences, man pages should never manipulate
them.

Setting
string &rsquo;AD&rsquo; configures the adjustment mode for
most formatted text. Typical values are &rsquo;b&rsquo; for
adjustment to both margins (the default), or &rsquo;l&rsquo;
for left alignment (ragged right margin). Any valid argument
to groff&rsquo;s &rsquo;ad&rsquo; request may be used. See
groff(7) for less-common choices.

groff -Tutf8 -dAD=l
-mdoc groff_mdoc.7 | less -R

Setting
register &rsquo;C&rsquo; to 1 numbers output pages
consecutively, rather than resetting the page number
to 1 (or the value of register &rsquo;P&rsquo;) with
each new mdoc document.

By
default, the package inhibits page breaks, headers, and
footers in the midst of the document text if it is being
displayed with a terminal device such as
&rsquo;latin1&rsquo; or &rsquo;utf8&rsquo;, to enable more
efficient viewing of the page. This behavior can be changed
to format the page as if for 66-line Teletype output by
setting the continuous rendering register &rsquo;cR&rsquo;
to zero while calling groff(1).

groff -Tlatin1 -rcR=0
-mdoc foo.man > foo.txt

On HTML devices, it
cannot be disabled.

Section
headings (defined with &rsquo;.Sh&rsquo;) and page titles in
headers (defined with &rsquo;.Dt&rsquo;) can be presented in
full capitals by setting the registers &rsquo;CS&rsquo; and
&rsquo;CT&rsquo;, respectively, to 1. These transformations
are off by default because they discard case distinction
information.

Setting
register &rsquo;D&rsquo; to 1 enables double-sided page
layout, which is only distinct when not continuously
rendering. It places the page number at the bottom right on
odd-numbered (recto) pages, and at the bottom left on
even-numbered (verso) pages, swapping places with the
arguments to &rsquo;.Os&rsquo;.

groff -Tps -rD1 -mdoc
foo.man > foo.ps

The value
of the &rsquo;FT&rsquo; register determines the
footer&rsquo;s distance from the page bottom; this amount is
always negative and should specify a scaling unit. At one
half-inch above this location, the page text is broken
before writing the footer. It is ignored if continuous
rendering is enabled. The default is -0.5i.

The
&rsquo;HF&rsquo; string sets the font used for section and
subsection headings; the default is &rsquo;B&rsquo; (bold
style of the default family). Any valid argument to
groff&rsquo;s &rsquo;ft&rsquo; request may be
used.

Normally,
automatic hyphenation is enabled using a mode appropriate to
the groff locale; see section &ldquo;Localization&ldquo; of
groff(7). It can be disabled by setting the &rsquo;HY&rsquo;
register to zero.

groff -Tutf8 -rHY=0
-mdoc foo.man | less -R

The
paragraph and subsection heading indentation amounts can be
changed by setting the registers &rsquo;IN&rsquo; and
&rsquo;SN&rsquo;.

groff -Tutf8 -rIN=5n
-rSN=2n -mdoc foo.man | less -R

The default paragraph
indentation is 7.2n on typesetters and 7n on terminals. The
default subsection heading indentation amount is 3n; section
headings are set with an indentation of zero.

The line
and title lengths can be changed by setting the registers
&rsquo;LL&rsquo; and &rsquo;LT&rsquo;,
respectively:

groff -Tutf8 -rLL=100n
-rLT=100n -mdoc foo.man | less -R

If not set, both
registers default to 78n for terminal devices and 6.5i
otherwise.

Setting
the &rsquo;P&rsquo; register starts enumeration of pages at
its value. The default is 1.

To change
the document font size to 11p or 12p, set register
&rsquo;S&rsquo; accordingly:

groff -Tdvi -rS11 -mdoc
foo.man > foo.dvi

Register &rsquo;S&rsquo;
is ignored when formatting for terminal devices.

Setting
the &rsquo;X&rsquo; register to a page number p
numbers its successors as pa, pb, pc,
and so forth. The register tracking the suffixed page letter
uses format &rsquo;a&rsquo; (see the &rsquo;af&rsquo;
request in groff(7)).

Files 
/usr/share/groff/1.23.0/tmac/andoc.tmac

This brief groff program
detects whether the man or mdoc macro package is being used
by a document and loads the correct macro definitions,
taking advantage of the fact that pages using them must call
TH or Dd, respectively, before any other macros. A user
typing, for example,

groff -mandoc
page.1

need not know which
package the file page.1 uses. Multiple man pages, in
either format, can be handled; andoc.tmac reloads
each macro package as necessary.

/usr/share/groff/1.23.0/tmac/doc.tmac

implements the bulk of
the groff mdoc package and loads further components as
needed from the mdoc subdirectory.

/usr/share/groff/1.23.0/tmac/mdoc.tmac

is a wrapper that loads
doc.tmac.

/usr/share/groff/1.23.0/tmac/mdoc/doc-common

defines macros,
registers, and strings concerned with the production of
formatted output. It includes strings of the form
&rsquo;doc-volume-ds-X&rsquo; and
&rsquo;doc-volume-as-X&rsquo; for manual section
titles and architecture identifiers, respectively, where
X is an argument recognized by
.Dt.

/usr/share/groff/1.23.0/tmac/mdoc/doc-nroff

defines parameters
appropriate for rendering to terminal devices.

/usr/share/groff/1.23.0/tmac/mdoc/doc-ditroff

defines parameters
appropriate for rendering to typesetter devices.

/usr/share/groff/1.23.0/tmac/mdoc/doc-syms

defines many strings and
macros that interpolate formatted text, such as names of
operating system releases, *BSD libraries, and standards
documents. The string names are of the form
&rsquo;doc-str-O-V&rsquo;,
&rsquo;doc-str-St--S-I&rsquo; (observe the
double dashes), or &rsquo;doc-str-Lb-L&rsquo;, where
O is one of the operating system macros from section
General text domain above, V is an encoding of
an operating system release (sometimes omitted along with
the &rsquo;-&rsquo; preceding it), S an identifier
for a standards body or committee, I one for an issue
of a standard promulgated by S, and L a
keyword identifying a *BSD library.

Bugs

Section 3f has not been
added to the header routines.

&rsquo;.Fn&rsquo;
needs to have a check to prevent splitting up the line if
its length is too short. Occasionally it separates the last
parenthesis, and sometimes looks ridiculous if output lines
are being filled.

The list
and display macros do not do any keeps and certainly should
be able to.

As of
groff 1.23, &rsquo;Tn&rsquo; no longer changes the type
size; this functionality may return in the next
release.
