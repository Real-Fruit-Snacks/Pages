DESCRIPTION

nv is an
Xorg driver for NVIDIA video cards. The driver supports 2D
acceleration and provides support for the following
framebuffer depths: 8, 15, 16 (except Riva128) and 24. All
visual types are supported for depth 8, TrueColor and
DirectColor visuals are supported for the other depths with
the exception of the Riva128 which only supports TrueColor
in the higher depths.

driver supports PCI, PCI-Express and AGP video cards based

CONFIGURATION DETAILS

Please refer to
xorg.conf(5) for general configuration details. This section
only covers configuration details specific to this
driver.

The driver
auto-detects the chipset type and the amount of video memory
present for all chips.

The following
driver Options are supported: 
Option "HWCursor"
"boolean"

Enable or disable the HW
cursor. Default: on.

Option "NoAccel"
"boolean"

Disable or enable acceleration.
Default: acceleration is enabled.

Option "UseFBDev"
"boolean"

Enable or disable use of an
OS-specific fb interface (and is not supported on all OSs).
See fbdevhw(4) for further information. Default: off.

Option
"CrtcNumber"
"integer"

Many graphics cards with NVIDIA
chips have two video outputs. The driver attempts to
autodetect which one the monitor is connected to. In the
case that autodetection picks the wrong one, this option may
be used to force usage of a particular output. The options
are "0" or "1". Default:
autodetected.

Option "FlatPanel"
"boolean"

The driver usually can
autodetect the presence of a digital flat panel. In the case
that this fails, this option can be used to force the driver
to treat the attached device as a digital flat panel. With
this driver, a digital flat panel will work only if it was
POSTed by the BIOS, that is, the computer must have booted
to the panel. If you have a dual head card you may also need
to set the option CrtcNumber described above. Default:
autodetected.

Option "FPDither"
"boolean"

Many digital flat panels
(particularly ones on laptops) have only 6 bits per
component color resolution. This option tells the driver to
dither from 8 bits per component to 6 before the flat panel
truncates it. Default: off.

Option "FPScale"
"boolean"

Supported only on GeForce4 and
newer chips, this option tells to the driver to scale lower
resolutions up to the flat panel’s native resolution.
Default: on.

Option "Rotate"
"CW" 
Option "Rotate" "CCW"

Rotate the display clockwise or
counterclockwise. This mode is unaccelerated. Default: no
rotation.

Note: The
Resize and Rotate extension will be disabled if the Rotate
"CW" or Rotate "CCW" options are
used.

Option "Rotate"
"RandR"

Enable rotation of the screen
using the Resize and Rotate extension. This mode is
unaccelerated. Default: no rotation support.

Option "ShadowFB"
"boolean"

Enable or disable use of the
shadow framebuffer layer. Default: off.
