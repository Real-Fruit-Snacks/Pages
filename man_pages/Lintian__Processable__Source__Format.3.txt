NAME
       Lintian::Processable::Source::Format - Lintian interface to source
       format

SYNOPSIS
           my $collect = Lintian::Processable::Source::Format->new;

DESCRIPTION
       Lintian::Processable::Source::Format provides an interface to source
       format information.

INSTANCE METHODS
       source_format
       native
           Returns true if the source package is native and false otherwise.
           This is generally determined from the source format, though in the
           1.0 case the nativeness is determined by looking for the diff.gz
           (using the name of the source package and its version).

           If the source format is 1.0 and the version number is absent, this
           will return false (as native packages are a lot rarer than non-
           native ones).

           Note if the source format is missing, it is assumed to be a 1.0
           package.
