SYNOPSIS
       exim_msgdate [ -u|--unix | --GMT | --z|-Zulu | --UTC | -l|--local ]
             [ --base 36 | --base 62 | --base36 | --base62 | --b36 | --b62 ]
             [ --pid ] [ --debug ] [ --localhost_number ]
             [ -c c<full path to exim cnfig file> ]
             exim-message-id [ | exim-message-id ...]

       exim_msgdate --help|--man

DESCRIPTION
       exim_msgdate is a tool which converts an exim message-id to a human
       readable form, usuall just the date+time, but with the --pid option the
       process id as well.

Message IDs:
       Three exim message ID formats are recognized.  In each case the 'X's
       are taken from the base (see below) which depends upon the platform.

       XXXXXX-XXXXXX-XX
           found in the exim logfile,

       EXXXXXX-XXXXXX-XX
           found in the Message-Id header,

       XXXXXX
           just the first six characters of the message id.

OPTIONS
   Time Zones and Unix Time
       -u | --unix
           Display time as seconds since 1 Jan 1970, the Unix Epoch.

       --GMT -u|--UTC -z|--zulu
           Display time in GMT/UTC - we assume these are the same.  Zulu time
           is another name for GMT.

       -l | --local
           Display time in the local time-zone.

           Do not confuse this with the --localhost_number option.

       The default is the local timezone.

   User Assistance Options
       --help
           A brief list of the options

       --man
           A more detailed manual for exim_msgdate

       --debug
           Information about what went wrong, mostly for developers.

   Specialized Options
       --base n | --base36 | --base62
           The message-id is usually encoded in base-62 (0-9A-Za-z), but on
           systems with case-insensitive file systems, such as MacOS and
           Cygwin, base-36 (0-9A-Z) is used instead.  The installation script
           should have set the default appropriately, but these options allow
           the default base to be overridden.

           The default matches "exim"; in this installation it is base-62.

       --pid
           Report the process id as well as the date and time in the message-
           id.

       --localhost_number n
           If the Exim configuration option localhost_number has been set, the
           third and final section of the message-id will include this and the
           timer resolution will change (see the Exim Spec. for details).
           "Exim_msgdate" reads the Exim config file (see --C) to find this
           value, but it can be overridden with this option.

           The value is an integer between 0 and 16, or the value "none" which
           means there is no localhost_number.

           Do not confuse this with the --local option, which displays times
           in the local timezone.

       --C full path to exim configuration file
           This overrides the usual exim search path.  We set
           "localhost_number" from the exim configfile.

       -dexim_path
           The test harness passes the full path of the "exim" binary, or here
           the "exim_msgdate" being tested. Not currently used.
