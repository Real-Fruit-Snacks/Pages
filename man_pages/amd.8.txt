DESCRIPTION

Amd is a
daemon that automatically mounts filesystems whenever a file
or directory within that filesystem is accessed. Filesystems
are automatically unmounted when they appear to have become
quiescent.

Amd
operates by attaching itself as an NFS server
to each of the specified directories. Lookups
within the specified directories are handled by amd,
which uses the map defined by mapname to determine
how to resolve the lookup. Generally, this will be a host
name, some filesystem information and some mount options for
the given filesystem.

In the first
form depicted above, amd will print a short help
string. In the second form, if no options are specified, or
the -F is used, amd will read configuration
parameters from the file conf_file which defaults to
/etc/am-utils/amd.conf. The last form is described
below.

OPTIONS

−a
temporary-directory

Specify an alternative location
for the real mount points. The default is /amd.

−c
duration

Specify a duration, in
seconds, that a looked up name remains cached when not in
use. The default is 5 minutes.

−d
domain

Specify the local domain name.
If this option is not given the domain name is determined
from the hostname.

−k
kernel-arch

Specifies the kernel
architecture. This is used solely to set the ${karch}
selector.

−l
logfile

Specify a logfile in which to
record mount and unmount events. If logfile is the
string syslog then the log messages will be sent to
the system log daemon by syslog(3). The default
syslog facility used is LOG_DAEMON. If you wish to change
it, append its name to the log file name, delimited by a
single colon. For example, if logfile is the string
syslog:local7 then Amd will log messages via
syslog(3) using the LOG_LOCAL7 facility (if it exists
on the system).

−n

Normalize hostnames. The name refereed to by ${rhost} is
normalized relative to the host database before being used.
The effect is to translate aliases into
’’official’’ names.

−o
op_sys_ver

Override the compiled-in
version number of the operating system. Useful when the
built in version is not desired for backward compatibility
reasons. For example, if the build in version is
’’2.5.1’’, you can override it to
’’5.5.1’’, and use older maps that
were written with the latter in mind.

−p

Print PID. Outputs the process-id of amd to
standard output where it can be saved into a file.

−r

Restart existing mounts. Amd will scan the mount
file table to determine which filesystems are currently
mounted. Whenever one of these would have been auto-mounted,
amd inherits it.

−t
timeout.retransmit

Specify the NFS timeout
interval, in tenths of a second, between NFS/RPC
retries (for UDP only). The default is 0.8 seconds. The
second value alters the restransmit counter, which defaults
to 11 retransmissions. Both of these values are used by the
kernel to communicate with amd. Useful defaults are supplied
if either or both values are missing.

Amd relies on
the kernel RPC retransmit mechanism to trigger mount
retries. The values of these parameters change the overall
retry interval. Too long an interval gives poor interactive
response; too short an interval causes excessive
retries.

−v

Version. Displays version and configuration information
on standard error.

−w
interval

Specify an interval, in
seconds, between attempts to dismount filesystems that have
exceeded their cached times. The default is 2 minutes.

−x
options

Specify run-time logging
options. The options are a comma separated list chosen from:
fatal, error, user, warn, info, map, stats, all.

−y
domain

Specify an alternative NIS
domain from which to fetch the NIS maps. The default is the
system domain name. This option is ignored if NIS support is
not available.

−C
cluster-name

Specify an alternative HP-UX
cluster name to use.

−D
option

Select from a variety of debug
options. Prefixing an option with the strings no
reverses the effect of that option. Options are cumulative.
The most useful option is all. Since −D
is only used for debugging other options are not documented
here: the current supported set of options is listed by the
−v option and a fuller description is available in the
program source.

−F
conf_file

Specify an amd configuration
file to use. See amd.conf(5) for description of this
file’s format. This configuration file is used to
specify any options in lieu of typing many of them on the
command line. The amd.conf file includes directives
for every command line option amd has, and many more that
are only available via the configuration file facility. The
configuration file specified by this option is processed
after all other options had been processed, regardless of
the actual location of this option on the command line.

−H

Print help and usage string.

−O
op_sys_name

Override the compiled-in name
of the operating system. Useful when the built in name is
not desired for backward compatibility reasons. For example,
if the build in name is ’’sunos5’’,
you can override it to ’’sos5’’, and
use older maps which were written with the latter in
mind.

−S

Do not lock the running executable pages of amd into
memory. To improve amd’s performance, systems that
support the plock(3) call, could lock the amd process
into memory. This way there is less chance the operating
system will schedule, page out, and swap the amd process as
needed. This tends improves amd’s performance, at the
cost of reserving the memory used by the amd process (making
it unavailable for other processes). If this behavior is not
desired, use the −S option.

−T tag

Specify a tag to use with amd.conf(5). All map
entries tagged with tag will be processed. Map
entries that are not tagged are always processed. Map
entries that are tagged with a tag other than tag
will not be processed.

FILES

/amd

directory under which
filesystems are dynamically mounted

/etc/am-utils/amd.conf

default configuration file

CAVEATS

Some care may
be required when creating a mount map.

Symbolic links
on an NFS filesystem can be incredibly inefficient. In most
implementations of NFS, their interpolations are not cached
by the kernel and each time a symlink is encountered during
a lookuppn translation it costs an RPC call to the
NFS server. It would appear that a large improvement in
real-time performance could be gained by adding a cache
somewhere. Replacing symlinks with a suitable incarnation of
the auto-mounter results in a large real-time speedup, but
also causes a large number of process context switches.

A weird
imagination is most useful to gain full advantage of all the
features.
