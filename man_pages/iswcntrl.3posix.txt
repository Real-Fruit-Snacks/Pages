ISWCNTRL(3POSIX)           POSIX Programmer's Manual          ISWCNTRL(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       iswcntrl, iswcntrl_l — test for a control wide-character code

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wctype.h>

       int iswcntrl(wint_t wc);
       int iswcntrl_l(wint_t wc, locale_t locale);

DESCRIPTION
       For iswcntrl(): The functionality described on this reference  page  is
       aligned  with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements
       described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume  of
       POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The  iswcntrl()  and  iswcntrl_l() functions shall test whether wc is a
       wide-character code representing a character of class cntrl in the cur‐
       rent  locale, or in the locale represented by locale, respectively; see
       the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Chapter 7, Locale.

       The wc argument is a wint_t, the value of which the  application  shall
       ensure  is  a wide-character code corresponding to a valid character in
       the locale used by the function, or equal to the  value  of  the  macro
       WEOF. If the argument has any other value, the behavior is undefined.

       The behavior is undefined if the locale argument to iswcntrl_l() is the
       special locale object LC_GLOBAL_LOCALE or is not a valid locale  object
       handle.

RETURN VALUE
       The  iswcntrl()  and iswcntrl_l() functions shall return non-zero if wc
       is a control wide-character code; otherwise, they shall return 0.

ERRORS
       No errors are defined.

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       To ensure applications  portability,  especially  across  natural  lan‐
       guages,  only  these functions and the functions in the reference pages
       listed in the SEE ALSO section should be used for character classifica‐
       tion.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
