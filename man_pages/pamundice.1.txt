NAME
       pamundice - combine grid of images (tiles) into one

EXAMPLE
           $ pamdice myimage.ppm -outstem=myimage_part -width=10 -height=8
           $ pamundice myimage_part_%1d_%1a.ppm -across=10 -down=8 >myimage.ppm

           $ pamundice myimage.ppm myimage_part_%2a -across=13 -hoverlap=9

SYNOPSIS
       pamundice

       [-across=n]

       [-down=n]

       [-hoverlap=pixels]

       [-voverlap=pixels]

       [-verbose]

       {input_filename_pattern, -listfile=filename}

       You  can  use  the minimum unique abbreviation of the options.  You can
       use two hyphens instead of one.  You can separate an option  name  from
       its value with white space instead of an equals sign.

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       pamundice  reads a bunch of Netpbm images as input and combines them as
       a grid of tiles into a single output image of the same kind on Standard
       Output.

       You can optionally make the pieces overlap.

       The images can either be in files whose names indicate where they go in
       the
         output (e.g. 'myimage_part_03_04' could be the image for Row 3,
         Column 4 - see the input_filename_pattern argument) or listed in a
         file, with a -listfile option.

       The input images must all have the same format (PAM,  PPM,  etc.)   and
       maxval  and  for  PAM must have the same depth and tuple type.  All the
       images in a rank (horizontal row of tiles) must have the  same  height.
       All  the images in a file (vertical column of tiles) must have the same
       width.  But it is not required that every rank have the same height  or
       every file have the same width.

       pamdice is the inverse of pamundice.  You can use pamundice to reassem‐
       ble an image sliced up by pamdice.  You can use pamdice to recreate the
       tiles  of  an  image created by pamundice, but to do this, the original
       ranks must all have been the same height except for the bottom one  and
       the  original  files must all have been the same width except the right
       one.

       One use for this is to process an image in pieces when the whole  image
       is too large to process.  For example, you might have an image so large
       that an image editor can't read it all into memory or processes it very
       slowly.  You can split it into smaller pieces with pamdice, edit one at
       a time, and then reassemble them with pamundice.

       Of course, you can also use  pamundice  to  compose  various  kinds  of
       checkerboard images, for example, you could write a program to render a
       chessboard by computing an image of each square, then  using  pamundice
       to assemble them into a board.

       An alternative to join images in a single direction (i.e. a single rank
       or a single file) is pnmcat.  pnmcat gives you  more  flexibility  than
       pamundice in identifying the input images: you can supply them on Stan‐
       dard Input or as a list of arbitrarily named files.

       To join piecewise photographs, use pnmstitch instead of pamundice,  be‐
       cause it figures out where the pieces overlap, even if they don't over‐
       lap exactly vertically or horizontally.

       To create an image of the same tile repeated in a grid, that's pnmtile.

       pnmindex does a similar thing to pamundice:  it  combines  a  bunch  of
       small images in a grid into a big one.  But its purpose is to produce a
       an index image of the input images.  So it leaves  space  between  them
       and has labels for them, for example.

ARGUMENTS
       Unless  you  use a -listfile option,, there is one non-option argument,
       and it is mandatory: input_filename_pattern.  This tells pamundice what
       files contain the input tiles.

       pamundice reads the input images from files which are named with a pat‐
       tern that indicates their positions in the combined image.   For  exam‐
       ple,  tile_00_05.ppm  could be the 6th tile over in the 1st rank, while
       tile_04_01 is the 2nd tile over in the 5th rank.

       You cannot supply any of the data on Standard Input, and the files must
       be the kind that pamundice can close and reopen and read the same image
       a second time (e.g. a regular file is fine; a named  pipe  is  probably
       not).

       input_filename_pattern  is a printf-style pattern.  (See the standard C
       library printf  subroutine).   For  the  example  above,  it  would  be
       tile_%2d_%2a.ppm.  The only possible conversion specifiers are:

       d      "down": The rank (row) number, starting with 0.

       a      "across": The file (column) number, starting with 0.

       %      The per cent character (%).

       The  number between the % and the conversion specifier is the precision
       and is required.  It says how many characters of the file name are  de‐
       scribed  by  that  conversion.   The rank or file number is filled with
       leading zeroes as necessary.

       So the example tile_%2d_%2a.ppm means to get the name of the file  that
       contains the tile at Rank 0, File 5, you:

       •      replace  the  "%2d"  with  the rank number, as a 2 digit decimal
              number: "00"

       •      Replace the "%2a" with the file number, as  a  2  digit  decimal
              number: "05"

       Note  that this pattern describes file names that pamdice produces, ex‐
       cept that the precision may be more or  less.   (pamdice  uses  however
       many digits are required for the highest numbered image).

OPTIONS
       In  addition  to  the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm
       (most notably -quiet, see
        Common Options ⟨index.html#commonoptions⟩ ), pamundice recognizes  the
       following command line options:

       -across=N
              This  is the number of tiles across in the grid, i.e. the number
              of tiles in each rank, or the number of files.

              Default is 1.

       -down=N
              This is the number of tiles up and down in the  grid,  i.e.  the
              number of tiles in each file, or the number of ranks.

              Default is 1.

       -hoverlap=pixels
              This  is the amount in pixels to overlap the tiles horizontally.
              pamundice clips this much off the right edge of every  tile  be‐
              fore  joining  it to the adjacent image to the right.  The tiles
              along the right edge remain whole.

              There must not be any input image narrower than this.

              Note that this undoes the effect of the same -hoverlap option of
              pamdice.

              Default is zero -- no overlap.

       -voverlap=pixels
              This  is  analogous to -hoverlap, but pamundice clips the bottom
              edge of each image before joining it to the one below.

       -listfile=filename
              This option names a file that contains the names of all the  in‐
              put  files.   This  is  an alternative to specifying a file name
              pattern as an argument.

              The named file contains file name, one per line.  Each file con‐
              tains the
                image for one tile, in row-major order, top to bottom, left to
              right.  So
                the first file is the upper left tile, the second is  the  one
              to right of
                that,  etc.   The number of lines in the file must be equal to
              the number of
                tiles in the output, the product of the -across and -down
                values.

              The file names have no meaning to pamundice.  You  can  use  the
              same
                file multiple times to have identical tiles in the output.

              This option was new in Netpbm 10.90 (March 2020).

       -verbose
              Print information about the processing to Standard Error.

HISTORY
       pamundice  was new in Netpbm 10.39 (June 2007).  Before that, pnmcat is
       the best substitute.
