NAME

sane-genesys -
SANE backend for GL646, GL841, GL843, GL847 and GL124 based
USB flatbed scanners

DESCRIPTION

The
sane-genesys library implements a SANE (Scanner
Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to USB flatbed
scanners based on the Genesys GL646, GL841, GL843, GL847 and
GL124 chips. At present, the following scanners are known to
work with this backend:

Canon LiDE
35/40/50/60/100/110/120/200/210/220/700 
Hewlett-Packard HP2300C/HP2400/HP3670/HP3690/G4010/G4050

Medion MD5345/MD6228/MD6274 
Panasonic KV-SS080 
Plustek OpticBook 3600 
Pentax DSmobile 600 
Syscan/Ambir DocketPORT 467/485/487/665/685 
Visioneer OneTouch 7100/Strobe XP100
(rev3)/XP200/XP300/Roadwarrior 
Xerox Travel Scanner 100, OneTouch 2400

This is stable
software for supported models. But if you test new or
untested scanners, keep your hand at the scanner&rsquo;s
plug and unplug it, if the head bumps at the end of the scan
area.

If you own a
scanner other than the ones listed above that works with
this backend, please let me know this by sending the
scanner&rsquo;s exact model name and the USB vendor and
device ids (e.g. from /proc/bus/usb/devices,
sane-find-scanner or syslog) to the sane-devel
mailing list. Even if the scanner&rsquo;s name is only
slightly different from the models mentioned above, please
let me know.

If you own a
scanner that isn&rsquo;t detected by the genesys backend but
has a GL646, GL841, GL843, GL847 or GL124 chipset, you can
try to add it to the backend.

CALIBRATION

To give correct
image quality, sheet fed scanners need to be calibrated
using the calibration sheet sold with the scanner. To do
calibration, you must insert this target in the feeder then
start calibration either by passing the --calibrate option
to scanimage or by clicking on the available
&rsquo;calibrate&rsquo; button in the &rsquo;advanced
options&rsquo; in a graphical frontend. The result of the
calibration is stored in a file in the home directory of the
user doing it. If you plug the scanner in another machine or
use it with another account, calibration will have to be
redone, unless you use the --calibration-file option. If no
home directory is defined, USERAPPPROFILE will be used, then
TMPDIR or TMP. If none of these directories exist, the
backend will try to write in the current working directory.
Flatbed scanners also make use of the calibration file as a
cache to avoid calibration before each scan. Calibration
file name is the name of the scanner model if only one
scanner is detected. In the case of several identical model,
the file name will be the name of the logical USB device
name. The expiration time manages the time a calibration is
valid in cache. A value of -1 means forever, 0 means no
cache.

EXTRAS SCAN OPTIONS

--lamp-off-time
number

The lamp will be turned off
after the given time (in minutes). A value of 0 means that
the lamp won&rsquo;t be turned off.

--threshold
percent

0..100% (in steps of 1). Select minimum brightness to
get a white point. Pixels with brightness below that value
will be scanned as black.

--brightness
value

-100..100 (in steps of 1). Set the brightness
enhancement. 0 for no enhancement, negative values to
decrease brigthness, and positive values to increase it.

--contrast
value

-100..100 (in steps of 1). Set the contrast enhancement.
0 for no enhancement, negative values to decrease contrast,
and positive values to increase it.

--disable-interpolation
yes|no

When using high resolutions
where the horizontal resolution is smaller than vertical
resolution, data is expanded by software to preserve picture
geometry. This can be disabled by this option to get real
scanned data.

--disable-dynamic-lineart
yes|no

Disable use of a software
adaptive algorithm to generate lineart and rely on hardware
lineart.

--color-filter
None|Red|Green|Blue

When using gray or lineart this
option selects the used color. Using a color filter will
give a monochrome scan. CIS based scanners can to true gray
when no filter (None value) is selected.

--lamp-off-scan

The lamp will be turned off
during the scan. Calibration is still done with lamp on.

--clear-calibration

Clear calibration cache data,
triggering a new calibration for the device when the next
scan will happen.

--calibration-file

Specify the calibration file
name to use. At least the directory containing the file must
exist, since it won&rsquo;t be created. This option is
disabled if the backend is ran as root. It maybe used in
case of sheet-fed scanners to share a calibration file for
several users.

--expiration-time

Specify the time (in minutes) a
cached calibration is considered valid. If older than the
given value, a new calibration is done. A value of -1 means
no expiration and cached value are kept forever unless
cleared by userwith the calibration clear option. A value of
0 means cache is disabled.

Additionally,
several &rsquo;software&rsquo; options are exposed by the
backend. These are reimplementations of features provided
natively by larger scanners, but running on the host
computer. This enables smaller machines to have similar
capabilities. Please note that these features are somewhat
simplistic, and may not perform as well as the native
implementations. Note also that these features all require
that the driver cache the entire image in memory. This will
almost certainly result in a reduction of scanning
speed.

--swcrop

Requests the driver to detect the extremities of the
paper within the larger image, and crop the empty edges.

--swdeskew

Requests the driver to detect the rotation of the paper
within the larger image, and counter the rotation.

--swdespeck
--despeck X

Requests the driver to find and remove dots of X
diameter or smaller from the image, and fill the space with
the average surrounding color.

--swskip
0..100% (in steps of 1) [0]

Request driver to discard pages
with low numbers of dark pixels.

--swderotate[=(yes|no)]
[no]

Request driver to detect and
correct 90 degree image rotation.

SYSTEM ISSUES

This backend
needs libusb-0.1.6 or later installed, and hasn&rsquo;t
tested in other configuration than a linux kernel 2.6.9 or
higher. However, it should work any system with libusb where
the SANE package can be compiled. For setting permissions
and general USB information look at sane-usb(5).

CONFIGURATION

The contents of
the genesys.conf file is a list of usb lines
containing vendor and product ids that correspond to USB
scanners. The file can also contain option lines. Empty
lines and lines starting with a hash mark (#) are ignored.
The scanners are autodetected by usb vendor_id
product_id statements which are already included into
genesys.conf. "vendor_id" and
"product_id" are hexadecimal numbers that identify
the scanner.

FILES

/etc/sane.d/genesys.conf

The backend configuration file
(see also description of SANE_CONFIG_DIR below).

/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-genesys.a

The static library implementing
this backend.

/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-genesys.so

The shared library implementing
this backend (present on systems that support dynamic
loading).

ENVIRONMENT

SANE_CONFIG_DIR

This environment variable
specifies the list of directories that may contain the
configuration file. Under UNIX, the directories are
separated by a colon (&rsquo;:&rsquo;), under OS/2, they are
separated by a semi-colon (&rsquo;;&rsquo;). If this
variable is not set, the configuration file is searched in
two default directories: first, the current working
directory (".") and then in /etc/sane.d. If the
value of the environment variable ends with the directory
separator character, then the default directories are
searched after the explicitly specified directories. For
example, setting SANE_CONFIG_DIR to
"/tmp/config:" would result in directories
"tmp/config", ".", and
"/etc/sane.d" being searched (in this order).

SANE_DEBUG_GENESYS

If the library was compiled
with debug support enabled, this environment variable
controls the debug level for this backend. Higher debug
levels increase the verbosity of the output. If the debug
level is set to 1 or higher, some debug options become
available that are normally hidden. Handle them with care.
This will print messages related to core genesys
functions.

SANE_DEBUG_GENESYS_IMAGE

If the library was compiled
with debug support enabled, this environment variable
enables logging of intermediate image data. To enable this
mode, set the environmental variable to 1.

Example (full
and highly verbose output for gl646): 
export SANE_DEBUG_GENESYS=255

LIMITATIONS

Powersaving
isn&rsquo;t implemented for gl646 based scanner. Dynamic
(emulated from gray data and with dithering) isn&rsquo;t
enabled for gl646 scanners. Hardware lineart is limited up
to 600 dpi for gl847 based scanners, due to the way image
sensors are built. 
This backend will be much slower if not using libusb-1.0. So
be sure 
that sane-backends is built with the --enable-libusb_1_0
option.

BUGS

For the LiDE
200, the scanned data at 4800 dpi is obtained "as
is" from sensor. It seems the windows driver does some
digital processing to improve it, which is not implemented
in the backend.
