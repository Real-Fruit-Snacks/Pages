CTIME(3POSIX)              POSIX Programmer's Manual             CTIME(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       ctime, ctime_r — convert a time value to a date and time string

SYNOPSIS
       #include <time.h>

       char *ctime(const time_t *clock);
       char *ctime_r(const time_t *clock, char *buf);

DESCRIPTION
       For ctime(): The functionality described  on  this  reference  page  is
       aligned  with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements
       described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume  of
       POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The ctime() function shall convert the time pointed to by clock, repre‐
       senting time in seconds since the Epoch, to local time in the form of a
       string. It shall be equivalent to:

           asctime(localtime(clock))

       The  asctime(),  ctime(), gmtime(), and localtime() functions shall re‐
       turn values in one of two static objects: a broken-down time  structure
       and  an array of char.  Execution of any of the functions may overwrite
       the information returned in either of these objects by any of the other
       functions.

       The ctime() function need not be thread-safe.

       The  ctime_r()  function  shall convert the calendar time pointed to by
       clock to local time in exactly the same form as  ctime()  and  put  the
       string  into  the  array  pointed to by buf (which shall be at least 26
       bytes in size) and return buf.

       Unlike ctime(), the ctime_r() function is not required to  set  tzname.
       If  ctime_r() sets tzname, it shall also set daylight and timezone.  If
       ctime_r() does not set tzname, it shall not set daylight and shall  not
       set timezone.

RETURN VALUE
       The  ctime()  function  shall  return the pointer returned by asctime()
       with that broken-down time as an argument.

       Upon successful completion, ctime_r() shall return  a  pointer  to  the
       string pointed to by buf.  When an error is encountered, a null pointer
       shall be returned.

ERRORS
       No errors are defined.

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       These functions are included only for compatibility with  older  imple‐
       mentations.  They have undefined behavior if the resulting string would
       be too long, so the use of these functions should be  discouraged.   On
       implementations that do not detect output string length overflow, it is
       possible to overflow the output buffers in such a way as to  cause  ap‐
       plications to fail, or possible system security violations. Also, these
       functions do not support localized date  and  time  formats.  To  avoid
       these  problems, applications should use strftime() to generate strings
       from broken-down times.

       Values for the broken-down time structure can be  obtained  by  calling
       gmtime() or localtime().

       The  ctime_r()  function  is  thread-safe  and shall return values in a
       user-supplied buffer instead of possibly using a static data area  that
       may be overwritten by each call.

       Attempts  to use ctime() or ctime_r() for times before the Epoch or for
       times beyond the year 9999 produce undefined  results.  Refer  to  asc‐
       time().

RATIONALE
       The standard developers decided to mark the ctime() and ctime_r() func‐
       tions obsolescent even though they are in the ISO C standard due to the
       possibility  of  buffer  overflow. The ISO C standard also provides the
       strftime() function which can be used to avoid these problems.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       These functions may be removed in a future version.
