MATE-SESSION(1)             General Commands Manual            MATE-SESSION(1)

NAME
       mate-session - Start the MATE Desktop Environment.

SYNOPSIS
       mate-session [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       The  mate-session  program starts up the MATE desktop environment. This
       command is typically executed by your Login/Display Manager (like  GDM,
       LXDM, XDM, SLiM, or from your X startup scripts like .xinitrc). It will
       load either your saved session, or it will provide  a  default  session
       for  the  user  as  defined by the system administrator (or the default
       MATE installation on your system).

       The default session is defined in the dconf keys under  /org/mate/desk‐
       top/session/
       When  saving a session, mate-session saves the currently running appli‐
       cations in the ~/.config/mate-session/saved-session  directory  of  the
       users /home.

       mate-session is an X11 session manager. It can manage MATE applications
       as well as any other X11 SM compliant ones.

OPTIONS
   The following options are supported:
       -a, --autostart=DIR
              Start all applications defined in "DIR", instead of starting the
              applications  defined  in /org/mate/desktop/session/default-ses‐
              sion
              Multiple --autostart options can be passed.

       -f, --failsafe
              Run in fail-safe mode. User-specified applications will  not  be
              started.

       --debug
              Enable debugging code.

       --display=DISPLAY
              X display to use.

       --version
              Output version information and exit.

       -?, -h, --help
              Print standard command line options.

       --help-all
              Print all command line options.

ENVIRONMENT
   mate-session  sets  several  environment variables for the use of its child
       processes:
       SESSION_MANAGER

              This variable is used by session-manager aware clients  to  con‐
              tact mate-session.

       DISPLAY

              This  variable  is  set to the X display being used by mate-ses‐
              sion. Note that if the --display option is used  this  might  be
              different  from  the  setting  of  the environment variable when
              mate-session is invoked.

FILES
       ~/.config/autostart
       /usr/share/autostart
       /usr/share/mate/autostart

              The applications  defined  in  the  above  directories  will  be
              started on login. mate-session-properties(1) can be used to eas‐
              ily configure them.

       ~/.config/mate-session/saved-session

              This directory contains the list of applications  of  the  saved
              session.
