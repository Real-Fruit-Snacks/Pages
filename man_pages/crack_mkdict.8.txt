SYNOPSIS

crack_mkdict
file...

crack_packer
cracklib_dictpath

crack_unpacker
cracklib_dictpath

DESCRIPTION

crack_mkdict
takes a list of text files each containing a list of words,
one per line, It lowercases all words, removes control
characters, and sorts the lists. It outputs the cleaned up
list to standard output. The text files may be optionally
compressed with gzip(1).

If you supply
massive amounts of text to crack_mkdict you must have
enough free space available for use by the sort(1)
command. If you do not have 20Mb free in /var/tmp (or
whatever temporary area your sort(1) command uses),
have a look at the /usr/sbin/crack_mkdict program which
is a sh(1) program. You can usually tweak the
sort(1) command to use any large area of disk you
desire, by use of the &minus;T option.
crack_mkdict has a hook for this.

crack_packer
reads from standard input a list of sorted and cleaned words
and creates a database in the directory and prefix given by
the command line argument cracklib_dictpath. Three
files are created with the suffixes of .hwm, .pwd, and .pwi.
These three files are in the format that the
FascistCheck(3) subroutine and crack_unpacker,
crack_testlib(8), crack_testnum(8), and
crack_teststr(8) utilities understand. The number of
words read and written are printed on stdout(3).

crack_unpacker
reads from the database in the directory and prefix given by
the command line argument cracklib_dictpath and
outputs on standard output the list of words that make up
the database.

The database is
in a binary format generated by the utilities
crack_mkdict(8) and crack_packer(8). On a
Debian system the database is located in the directory
/var/cache/cracklib/cracklib_dict and is generated daily
with the program /etc/cron.daily/cracklib. The location is
also defined in the header file crack.h using the
constant CRACKLIB_DICTPATH though none of the
subroutines in the cracklib libraries have this location
hardcoded into their implementations.

FILES
