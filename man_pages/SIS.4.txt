SIS(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual SIS(4)

NAME

sis &mdash; SiS 900, SiS
7016 and NS DP83815/DP83816 Fast Ethernet device driver

SYNOPSIS

To compile this driver into the
kernel, place the following lines in your kernel
configuration file:

device
miibus 
device sis

Alternatively,
to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following line in loader.conf(5):

if_sis_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION

The sis driver provides
support for PCI Ethernet adapters and embedded controllers
based on the Silicon Integrated Systems SiS 900 and SiS 7016
Fast Ethernet controller chips.

This driver also
supports adapters based on the National Semiconductor
DP83815 (MacPhyter) and DP83816 PCI Ethernet controller
chip.

The SiS 900 is a
100Mbps Ethernet MAC and MII-compliant transceiver in a
single package. It uses a bus master DMA and a
scatter/gather descriptor scheme. The SiS 7016 is similar to
the SiS 900 except that it has no internal PHY, requiring
instead an external transceiver to be attached to its MII
interface. The SiS 900 and SiS 7016 both have a 128-bit
multicast hash filter and a single perfect filter entry for
the station address.

The NS DP83815
is also a 100Mbps Ethernet MAC with integrated PHY. The
NatSemi chip and the SiS 900 share many of the same features
and a fairly similar programming interface, hence both chips
are supported by the same driver.

The sis
driver supports the following media types:

autoselect

Enable
autoselection of the media type and options. The user can
manually override the autoselected mode by adding media
options to rc.conf(5).

10baseT/UTP

Set 10Mbps
operation. The ifconfig(8) mediaopt option can also
be used to select either &rsquo;full-duplex&rsquo; or
&rsquo;half-duplex&rsquo; modes.

100baseTX

Set 100Mbps
(Fast Ethernet) operation. The ifconfig(8) mediaopt
option can also be used to select either
&rsquo;full-duplex&rsquo; or &rsquo;half-duplex&rsquo;
modes.

The sis
driver supports the following media options:

full-duplex

Force full
duplex operation.

half-duplex

Force half
duplex operation.

For more
information on configuring this device, see ifconfig(8).

HARDWARE

The sis driver supports
Silicon Integrated Systems SiS 900 and SiS 7016 based Fast
Ethernet adapters and embedded controllers, as well as Fast
Ethernet adapters based on the National Semiconductor
DP83815 (MacPhyter) and DP83816 chips. Supported adapters
include:

SYSCTL VARIABLES

The following variable is
available as both sysctl(8) variable and loader(8)
tunable:

dev.sis.%unit.manual_pad

This variable controls how to
pad short frames for DP83815/DP83816 controllers on the
specified device. DP83815/DP83816 controllers are known to
pad 0xFF for short frames which is violation of RFC 1042.
Set this variable to a non-zero value to let driver manually
pad each short frame with zeros at the cost of extra CPU
cycles. The default value is 0 to let hardware perform
automatic padding.

DIAGNOSTICS

sis%d: couldn&rsquo;t map
ports/memory  A fatal initialization error has
occurred.

sis%d:
couldn&rsquo;t map interrupt  A fatal
initialization error has occurred.

sis%d:
watchdog timeout  The device has stopped responding
to the network, or there is a problem with the network
connection (e.g. a cable fault).

sis%d: no
memory for rx list  The driver failed to allocate
an mbuf for the receiver ring.

sis%d: no
memory for tx list  The driver failed to allocate
an mbuf for the transmitter ring when allocating a pad
buffer or collapsing an mbuf chain into a cluster.

sis%d: chip
is in D3 power state -- setting to D0  This message
applies only to adapters which support power management.
Some operating systems place the controller in low power
mode when shutting down, and some PCI BIOSes fail to bring
the chip out of this state before configuring it. The
controller loses all of its PCI configuration in the D3
state, so if the BIOS does not set it back to full power
mode in time, it will not be able to configure it correctly.
The driver tries to detect this condition and bring the
adapter back to the D0 (full power) state, but this may not
be enough to return the driver to a fully operational
condition. If you see this message at boot time and the
driver fails to attach the device as a network interface,
you will have to perform a warm boot to have the device
properly configured.

Note that this
condition only occurs when warm booting from another
operating system. If you power down your system prior to
booting FreeBSD, the card should be configured
correctly.
