TIMER_DELETE(3POSIX)       POSIX Programmer's Manual      TIMER_DELETE(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       timer_delete — delete a per-process timer

SYNOPSIS
       #include <time.h>

       int timer_delete(timer_t timerid);

DESCRIPTION
       The timer_delete() function deletes the specified timer, timerid,  pre‐
       viously  created  by the timer_create() function. If the timer is armed
       when timer_delete() is called, the behavior shall be as if the timer is
       automatically  disarmed before removal. The disposition of pending sig‐
       nals for the deleted timer is unspecified.

       The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the  timerid  argu‐
       ment  to  timer_delete()  does not correspond to a timer ID returned by
       timer_create() but not yet deleted by timer_delete().

RETURN VALUE
       If successful, the timer_delete() function  shall  return  a  value  of
       zero.  Otherwise, the function shall return a value of -1 and set errno
       to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       No errors are defined.

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       None.

RATIONALE
       If an implementation detects that the value specified  by  the  timerid
       argument  to  timer_delete() does not correspond to a timer ID returned
       by timer_create() but not yet deleted by timer_delete(), it  is  recom‐
       mended that the function should fail and report an [EINVAL] error.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
