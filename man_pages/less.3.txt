NAME

less - perl
pragma to request less of something

SYNOPSIS

    use less 'CPU';

DESCRIPTION

This is a
user-pragma. If you&rsquo;re very lucky some code
you&rsquo;re using will know that you asked for less
CPU usage or ram or fat or... we just
can&rsquo;t know. Consult your documentation on everything
you&rsquo;re currently using.

For general
suggestions, try requesting "CPU" or
"memory".

    use less 'memory';
    use less 'CPU';
    use less 'fat';

If you ask for
nothing in particular, you&rsquo;ll be asking for
"less 'please'".

    use less 'please';

FOR MODULE AUTHORS

less has been
in the core as a "joke" module for ages now and it
hasn&rsquo;t had any real way to communicating any
information to anything. Thanks to Nicholas Clark we have
user pragmas (see perlpragma) and now
"less" can do something.

You can
probably expect your users to be able to guess that they can
request less CPU or memory or just
"less" overall.

If the user
didn&rsquo;t specify anything, it&rsquo;s interpreted as
having used the "please" tag. It&rsquo;s
up to you to make this useful.

  # equivalent
  use less;
  use less 'please';

"BOOLEAN
= less->of( FEATURE )" 
The class method "less->of( NAME )"
returns a boolean to tell you whether your user requested
less of something.

  if ( less->of( 'CPU' ) ) {
      ...
  }
  elsif ( less->of( 'memory' ) ) {
  }

"FEATURES
= less->of()" 
If you don&rsquo;t ask for any feature, you get the list of
features that the user requested you to be nice to. This has
the nice side effect that if you don&rsquo;t respect
anything in particular then you can just ask for it and use
it like a boolean.

  if ( less->of ) {
      ...
  }
  else {
      ...
  }

CAVEATS

This probably
does nothing. 
This works only on 5.10+

At least it&rsquo;s backwards
compatible in not doing much.
