NAME

started &minus;
event signalling that a job is running

SYNOPSIS

started
JOB=JOB INSTANCE=INSTANCE
[ENV]...

DESCRIPTION

The
started event is generated by the Upstart
init(8) daemon when an instance of a job has finished
starting and is now running. The JOB environment
variable contains the job name, and the INSTANCE
environment variable contains the instance name which will
be empty for single-instance jobs.

init(8)
emits this event as an informational signal, services and
tasks started or stopped by this event will do so in
parallel with other activity. It is typically combined with
the stopping(7) event by services declaring a
dependency.

Job
configuration files may use the export stanza to
export environment variables from their own environment into
the started event. See init(5) for more
details.

EXAMPLE

A service that
wishes to depend on another service might use:

start on
started apache 
stop on stopping apache

A task that
must be run after another task or service has been started
might use:

start on
started postgresql
