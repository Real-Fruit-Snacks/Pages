NAME

qrap -
temporary qemu wrapper connecting UNIX domain socket to file
descriptor

SYNOPSIS

qrap
[FDNUM QEMU_CMD] [QEMU_ARG]...

DESCRIPTION

qrap is
a wrapper, designed specifically for usage with
qemu(1) and passt(1), connecting a UNIX domain
socket to a file descriptor, and running qemu(1) with
given arguments.

A running
instance of passt(1) is probed checking for UNIX
domain sockets, answering a dummy ARP request, with names
starting from /tmp/passt_1.socket up to
/tmp/passt_64.socket.

If first and
second arguments are not a socket number and a command, that
is, respectively, FDNUM and QEMU_CMD,
qrap will try to locate a qemu executable in
PATH and patch the command line to specify a network
device and a netdev back-end for usage with
passt(1).

If qrap
patches the command line, it will remove any potentially
conflicting network device, that is, any -netdev or
-net option, or any -device option with
argument starting with virtio-net-pci,,
virtio-net-ccw,, e1000,, e1000e,, or
rtl8139,.

EXAMPLES

Start qemu
explicitly passing its command name and a socket
number

$ ./qrap 5 kvm test.qcow2 -m
1024 -display none -nodefaults -nographic -net socket,fd=5
-net nic,model=virtio

Start qemu
without command name and socket number, patching
arguments

$ ./qrap test.qcow2 -m 1024
-display none -nodefaults -nographic

NOTES

This wrapper is
temporary: qemu commit 13c6be96618c ("net: stream: add
unix socket") introduces native AF_UNIX socket support,
and it should be included in qemu starting from the 7.2
release. It will be around for a little bit longer to give
users enough time to switch.
