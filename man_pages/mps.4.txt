CONFIGURATION

In all tunable descriptions
below, X represents the adapter number.

To disable MSI
interrupts for all mps driver instances, set this
tunable value in loader.conf(5):

hw.mps.disable_msi=1

To disable MSI
interrupts for a specific mps driver instance, set
this tunable value in loader.conf(5):

dev.mps.X.disable_msi=1

To disable MSI-X
interrupts for all mps driver instances, set this
tunable value in loader.conf(5):

hw.mps.disable_msix=1

To disable MSI-X
interrupts for a specific mps driver instance, set
this tunable value in loader.conf(5):

dev.mps.X.disable_msix=1

To set the
maximum number of DMA chains allocated for all adapters, set
this tunable in loader.conf(5):

hw.mps.max_chains=NNNN

To set the
maximum number of DMA chains allocated for a specific
adapter, set this tunable in loader.conf(5):

dev.mps.X.max_chains=NNNN

The default
max_chains value is 2048.

The current
number of free chain frames is stored in the
dev.mps.X.chain_free sysctl(8) variable.

The lowest
number of free chain frames seen since boot is stored in the
dev.mps.X.chain_free_lowwater sysctl(8) variable.

The number of
times that chain frame allocations have failed since boot is
stored in the dev.mps.X.chain_alloc_fail sysctl(8) variable.
This can be used to determine whether the max_chains tunable
should be increased to help performance.

The current
number of active I/O commands is shown in the
dev.mps.X.io_cmds_active sysctl(8) variable.

To set the
maximum number of pages that will be used per I/O for all
adapters, set this tunable in loader.conf(5):

hw.mps.max_io_pages=NNNN

To set the
maximum number of pages that will be used per I/O for a
specific adapter, set this tunable in loader.conf(5):

dev.mps.X.max_io_pages=NNNN

The default
max_io_pages value is -1, meaning that the maximum I/O size
that will be used per I/O will be calculated using the
IOCFacts values stored in the controller. The lowest value
that the driver will use for max_io_pages is 1, otherwise
IOCFacts will be used to calculate the maximum I/O size. The
smaller I/O size calculated from either max_io_pages or
IOCFacts will be the maximum I/O size used by the
driver.

The highest
number of active I/O commands seen since boot is stored in
the dev.mps.X.io_cmds_highwater sysctl(8) variable.

Devices can be
excluded from mps control for all adapters by setting
this tunable in loader.conf(5):

hw.mps.exclude_ids=Y

Y represents the
target ID of the device. If more than one device is to be
excluded, target IDs are separated by commas.

Devices can be
excluded from mps control for a specific adapter by
setting this tunable in loader.conf(5):

dev.mps.X.exclude_ids=Y

Y represents the
target ID of the device. If more than one device is to be
excluded, target IDs are separated by commas.

The adapter can
issue the StartStopUnit SCSI command to SATA
direct-access devices during shutdown. This allows the
device to quiesce powering down. To control this feature for
all adapters, set the

hw.mps.enable_ssu

tunable in
loader.conf(5) to one of these values:

0

Do not send SSU
to either HDDs or SSDs.

1

Send SSU to
SSDs, but not to HDDs. This is the default value.

2

Send SSU to
HDDs, but not to SSDs.

3

Send SSU to
both HDDs and SSDs.

To control this
feature for a specific adapter, set this tunable value in
loader.conf(5):

dev.mps.X.enable_ssu

The same set of
values are valid as when setting this tunable for all
adapters.

SATA disks that
take several seconds to spin up and fail the SATA Identify
command might not be discovered by the driver. This problem
can sometimes be overcome by increasing the value of the
spinup wait time in loader.conf(5) with the

hw.mps.spinup_wait_time=NNNN

tunable. NNNN
represents the number of seconds to wait for SATA devices to
spin up when the device fails the initial SATA Identify
command.

Spinup wait
times can be set for specific adapters in loader.conf(5):
with the

dev.mps.X.spinup_wait_time=NNNN

tunable. NNNN is
the number of seconds to wait for SATA devices to spin up
when they fail the initial SATA Identify command.

The driver can
map devices discovered by the adapter so that target IDs
corresponding to a specific device persist across resets and
reboots. In some cases it is possible for devices to lose
their mapped IDs due to unexpected behavior from certain
hardware, such as some types of enclosures. To overcome this
problem, a tunable is provided that will force the driver to
map devices using the Phy number associated with the device.
This feature is not recommended if the topology includes
multiple enclosures/expanders. If multiple
enclosures/expanders are present in the topology, Phy
numbers are repeated, causing all devices at these Phy
numbers except the first device to fail enumeration. To
control this feature for all adapters, set the

hw.mps.use_phy_num

tunable in
loader.conf(5) to one of these values:

-1

Only use Phy
numbers to map devices and bypass the driver’s mapping
logic.

0

Never use Phy
numbers to map devices.

1

Use Phy numbers
to map devices, but only if the driver’s mapping logic
fails to map the device that is being enumerated. This is
the default value.

To control this
feature for a specific adapter, set this tunable value in
loader.conf(5):

dev.mps.X.use_phy_num

The same set of
values are valid as when setting this tunable for all
adapters.

DEBUGGING

Driver diagnostic printing is
controlled in loader.conf(5) by using the global
hw.mps.debug_level and per-device
dev.mps.X.debug_level tunables. One can alter the
debug level for any adapter at run-time using the sysctl(8)
variable dev.mps.X.debug_level.

All
debug_level variables can be named by either an
integer value or a text string. Multiple values can be
specified together by either ORing the integer values or by
providing a comma-separated list of names. A text string
prefixed by "+" adds the specified debug levels to
the existing set, while the prefix "-" removes
them from the existing set. The current debug_level
status is reported in both formats for convenience. The
following levels are available:

Flag Name
Description 
0x0001 info Basic information (enabled by default) 
0x0002 fault Driver faults (enabled by default) 
0x0004 event Controller events 
0x0008 log Logging data from controller 
0x0010 recovery Tracing of recovery operations 
0x0020 error Parameter errors and programming bugs 
0x0040 init System initialization operations 
0x0080 xinfo More detailed information 
0x0100 user Tracing of user-generated commands (IOCTL) 
0x0200 mapping Tracing of device mapping 
0x0400 trace Tracing through driver functions
