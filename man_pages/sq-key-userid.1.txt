NAME

sq key userid -
Manage User IDs

SYNOPSIS

sq key
userid add [OPTIONS] FILE USERID 
sq key userid revoke [OPTIONS] USERID REASON
MESSAGE 
sq key userid strip [OPTIONS] FILE

DESCRIPTION

Manage User
IDs.

Add User IDs
to, or strip User IDs from a key.

SUBCOMMANDS

sq key
userid add 
Add a User ID.

A User ID can
contain a name, like ’Juliet’ or an email
address, like ’juliet [AT] example.org>’.
Historically, a name and email address were often combined
as a single User ID, like ’Juliet
juliet [AT] example.org>’.

’sq
userid add’ respects the reference time set by the
top-level ’--time’ argument. It sets the
creation time of the User ID’s binding signature to
the specified time.

sq key
userid revoke 
Revoke a User ID.

Creates a
revocation certificate for a User ID.

If
’--revocation-key’ is provided, then that key is
used to create the signature. If that key is different from
the certificate being revoked, this creates a third-party
revocation. This is normally only useful if the owner of the
certificate designated the key to be a designated
revoker.

If
’--revocation-key’ is not provided, then the
certificate must include a certification-capable key.

’sq key
userid revoke’ respects the reference time set by the
top-level ’--time’ argument. When set, it uses
the specified time instead of the current time, when
determining what keys are valid, and it sets the revocation
certificate’s creation time to the reference time
instead of the current time.

sq key
userid strip 
Strip a User ID.

Note that this
operation does not reliably remove User IDs from a
certificate that has already been disseminated! (OpenPGP
software typically appends new information it receives about
a certificate to its local copy of that certificate. Systems
that have obtained a copy of your certificate with the User
ID that you are trying to strip will not drop that User ID
from their copy.)

In most cases,
you will want to use the ’sq key userid revoke’
operation instead. That issues a revocation for a User ID,
which can be used to mark the User ID as invalidated.

However, this
operation can be useful in very specific cases, in
particular: to remove a mistakenly added User ID before it
has been uploaded to key servers or otherwise shared.

Stripping a
User ID may change how a certificate is interpreted. This is
because information about the certificate like algorithm
preferences, the primary key’s key flags, etc. is
stored in the User ID’s binding signature.

EXAMPLES

sq key
userid add 
First, generate a key:

sq key generate
--userid ’juliet [AT] example.org>’ \

--output juliet.key.pgp

Then, add a
User ID:

sq key userid
add --userid Juliet juliet.key.pgp \

--output juliet-new.key.pgp

Or, add a User
ID whose creation time is set to June 28, 2022 at midnight
UTC:

sq key userid
add --userid Juliet --creation-time 20210628 \

juliet.key.pgp --output
juliet-new.key.pgp

sq key
userid strip 
First, generate a key:

sq key generate
--userid ’juliet [AT] example.org>’ \

--output juliet.key.pgp

Then, strip a
User ID:

sq key userid
strip --userid ’juliet [AT] example.org>’
\

--output juliet-new.key.pgp
juliet.key.pgp
