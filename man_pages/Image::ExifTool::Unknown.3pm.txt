       Image::ExifTool::Unknown - Unknown EXIF maker notes tags

SYNOPSIS
       This module is loaded automatically by Image::ExifTool when required.

DESCRIPTION
       Image::ExifTool has definitions for the maker notes from many
       manufacturers, however information can sometimes be extracted from
       unknown manufacturers if the maker notes are in standard IFD format.
       This module contains the definitions necessary for Image::ExifTool to
       read the maker notes from unknown manufacturers.
