NAME
       config.guess - guess the build system triplet

SYNOPSIS
       config.guess [OPTION]

DESCRIPTION
       The GNU build system distinguishes three types of machines, the `build'
       machine on which the compilers are run, the `host' machine on which the
       package  being  built  will run, and, exclusively when you build a com‐
       piler, assembler etc., the `target' machine, for which the compiler be‐
       ing built will produce code.

       This script will guess the type of the `build' machine.

       Output the configuration name of the system `config.guess' is run on.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              print this help, then exit

       -t, --time-stamp
              print date of last modification, then exit

       -v, --version
              print version number, then exit

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       config.guess  might  need  to  compile and run C code, hence it needs a
       compiler  for  the  `build'  machine:  use  the  environment   variable
       `CC_FOR_BUILD'  to  specify  the  compiler  for  the build machine.  If
       `CC_FOR_BUILD' is not specified, `CC' will be used.  Be sure to specify
       `CC_FOR_BUILD' if `CC' is a cross-compiler to the `host' machine.

         CC_FOR_BUILD    a native C compiler, defaults to `cc'
         CC              a native C compiler, CC_FOR_BUILD is preferred
