NAME

mtracebis - a
multicast trace client

SYNOPSIS

mtracebis [-h]
[-v]

mtracebis
 []

DESCRIPTION

mtracebis is a
program for initiating multicast traceroute, or
"mtrace", queries.

It can initiate
two types of mtrace queries: weak and group.

Weak tests
whether the interfaces towards the source are multicast
enabled and is initiated by supplying only the multicast
source address.

Group tests
whether there is multicast routing protocol state for
particular multicast group and is initiated by supplying
mutlicast source and group.

The first query
sent is a full query, capable of crossing the network all
the way to the source. If this fails, hop-by-hop queries are
initiated.

Hop-by-hop
queries start by requesting only a response from the nearest
router. Following that, next query is extended to the next
two routers, and so on... until a set of routers is tested
for connectivity.
