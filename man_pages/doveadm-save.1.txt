NAME

doveadm-save -
Save email to a userâ€™s mailbox

SYNOPSIS

doveadm
[-Dv] save [-S socket_path]
-u user [-m mailbox] [mail-file]

doveadm [-Dv] save [-S
socket_path] -A [-m mailbox]
[mail-file] 
doveadm [-Dv] [-f formatter]
save [-S socket_path] -F
file [-m mailbox] [mail-file]

DESCRIPTION

doveadm
save can be used to save messages. This can be useful
for scripts and for debugging. Sieve is not invoked for
saved messages, but quota is enforced.

OPTIONS

Global
doveadm(1) options:

-D

Enables verbosity and debug messages.

-o setting=value

Overrides the configuration
setting from /etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf and
from the userdb with the given value. In order to
override multiple settings, the -o option may be
specified multiple times.

-v

Enables verbosity, including progress counter.

Command
specific options:

-A

If the -A option is
present, the command will be performed for all users.
Using this option in combination with system users from
userdb { driver = passwd } is not recommended,
because it contains also users with a lower UID than the one
configured with the first_valid_uid setting.

When the SQL
userdb module is used make sure that the
iterate_query setting in
/etc/dovecot/dovecot-sql.conf.ext matches your
database layout. When using the LDAP userdb module, make
sure that the iterate_attrs and iterate_filter
settings in /etc/dovecot/dovecot-ldap.conf.ext match
your LDAP schema. Otherwise doveadm(1) will be unable
to iterate over all users.

-F file

Execute the command for
all the users in the file. This is similar to the
-A option, but instead of getting the list of users
from the userdb, they are read from the given file.
The file contains one username per line.

-S socket_path

The option's argument is either
an absolute path to a local UNIX domain socket, or a
hostname and port (hostname:port), in order to
connect a remote host via a TCP socket.

This allows an
administrator to execute doveadm(1) mail commands
through the given socket.

-u user/mask

Run the command only for
the given user. It's also possible to use '*'
and '?' wildcards (e.g. -u *@example.org). 
When neither the -A option, nor the
-F file option, nor the
-u user was specified, the command
will be executed with the environment of the currently
logged in user.

-m mailbox

Store mail to specified mailbox
instead of INBOX.

EXAMPLE

echo
"hello, world" | doveadm save -u
testuser@testdomain
