NAME

rmt &minus;
remote magtape protocol module

SYNOPSIS

/usr/sbin/rmt

DESCRIPTION

rmt is a
program used by the remote dump and restore programs in
manipulating a magnetic tape drive through an interprocess
communication connection. rmt is normally started up
with an rexec(3SOCKET) or rcmd(3SOCKET)
call.

The rmt
program accepts requests that are specific to the
manipulation of magnetic tapes, performs the commands, then
responds with a status indication. All responses are in
ASCII and in one of two forms. Successful commands
have responses of: 
Anumber\n

where number is an
ASCII representation of a decimal number.

Unsuccessful
commands are responded to with: 
Eerror-number\n
error-message\n

where
error-number is one of the possible error numbers
described in intro(3), and error-message is
the corresponding error string as printed from a call to
perror(3C).

The protocol
consists of the following commands:

S\n

Return the status of the open device, as obtained with a
MTIOCGET ioctl call. If the operation was successful,
an "ack" is sent with the size of the status
buffer, then the status buffer is sent (in binary).

Cdevice
\n

Close the currently open
device. 
The device specified is ignored.

Ioperation
\ncount\n

Perform a MTIOCOP
ioctl(2) command using the specified parameters. The
parameters are interpreted as the ASCII
representations of the decimal values to place in the
mt_op and mt_count fields of the structure
used in the ioctl call. When the operation is
successful the return value is the count
parameter.

Loffset
\nwhence\n

Perform an lseek(2)
operation using the specified parameters. The response value
is returned from the lseek call.

Odevice
\nmode\n

Open the specified
device using the indicated mode. device
is a full pathname, and mode is an ASCII
representation of a decimal number suitable for passing to
open(9E). If a device is already open, it is closed
before a new open is performed.

Rcount
\n

Read count bytes of data
from the open device. rmt performs the requested
read(9E) and responds with
Acount-read\n if the read was successful;
otherwise an error in standard format is returned. 
If the read was successful, the data read is sent.

Wcount
\n

Write data onto the open
device. rmt reads count bytes from the
connection, aborting if a premature EOF is
encountered. 
The response value is returned from the write(9E)
call.

Any other
command causes rmt to exit.
