NAME

sd_id128_randomize
- Generate 128-bit IDs

SYNOPSIS

#include

int
sd_id128_randomize(sd_id128_t *ret); 

DESCRIPTION

sd_id128_randomize()
generates a new randomized 128-bit ID and returns it in
ret. Every invocation returns a new randomly
generated ID. This uses the getrandom(2) kernel
random number generator.

Note that
sd_id128_randomize() always returns a UUID Variant 1
Version 4 compatible ID. It is hence guaranteed that this
function will never return the ID consisting of all zero or
all one bits (SD_ID128_NULL,
SD_ID128_ALLF).

For more
information about the "sd_id128_t" type, see
sd-id128(3).

systemd-id128(1)'s
new command may be used as a command line front-end
for sd_id128_randomize().

RETURN VALUE

The call
returns 0 on success (in which case ret is filled
in), or a negative errno-style error code.

NOTES

Functions
described here are available as a shared library, which can
be compiled against and linked to with the
libsystemd pkg-config(1) file.

The code
described here uses getenv(3), which is declared to
be not multi-thread-safe. This means that the code calling
the functions described here must not call setenv(3)
from a parallel thread. It is recommended to only do calls
to setenv() from an early phase of the program when
no other threads have been started.

HISTORY

sd_id128_randomize()
was added in version 187.
