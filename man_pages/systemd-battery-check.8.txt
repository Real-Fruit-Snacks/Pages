NAME
       systemd-battery-check.service, systemd-battery-check - Check battery
       level whether there's enough charge, and power off if not.

SYNOPSIS
       systemd-battery-check.service

       /lib/systemd/systemd-battery-check [OPTIONS...]

DESCRIPTION
       systemd-battery-check.service is used to check the battery level during
       the early boot stage to determine whether there's sufficient battery
       power to carry on with the booting process.

       systemd-battery-check returns success if the device is connected to an
       AC power source or if the battery charge is greater than 5%. It returns
       failure otherwise.

OPTIONS
       The following options are understood by systemd-battery-check:

       -h, --help
           Print a short help text and exit.

       --version
           Print a short version string and exit.

EXIT STATUS
       On success (running on AC power or battery capacity greater than 5%), 0
       is returned, a non-zero failure code otherwise.

KERNEL COMMAND LINE
       The following variables are understood:

       systemd.battery-check=BOOL
           Takes a boolean. If specified with false, systemd-battery-check
           command will return immediately with exit status 0 without checking
           battery capacity and AC power existence, and the service
           systemd-battery-check.service will succeed. This may be useful when
           the command wrongly detects and reports battery capacity percentage
           or AC power existence, or when you want to boot the system
           forcibly.
