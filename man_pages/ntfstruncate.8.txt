NAME

ntfstruncate -
truncate a file on an NTFS volume

SYNOPSIS

ntfstruncate
[options] device file [attr-type
[attr-name]] new-length

DESCRIPTION

ntfstruncate
truncates (or extends) a specified attribute belonging to a
file or directory, to a specified length.

OPTIONS

Below is a
summary of all the options that ntfstruncate accepts.
Nearly all options have two equivalent names. The short name
is preceded by - and the long name is preceded by
--. Any single letter options, that don&rsquo;t take
an argument, can be combined into a single command, e.g.
-fv is equivalent to -f -v. Long named options
can be abbreviated to any unique prefix of their name.

-f, --force

This will override some
sensible defaults, such as not using a mounted volume. Use
this option with caution.

-h, --help

Show a list of options with a
brief description of each one.

-l

Display licensing information.

-n,
--no-action

Simulate the truncation without
actually write to device.

-q, --quiet

Suppress some
debug/warning/error messages.

-v, --verbose

Display more
debug/warning/error messages.

-V, --version

Show the version number,
copyright and license of ntfstruncate.

attr-type

Define a particular attribute
type to be truncated (advanced use only). By default, the
unnamed $DATA attribute (the contents of a plain file) will
be truncated. The attribute has to be specified by a number
in decimal or hexadecimal :

attr-name

Define the name of the
particular attribute type to be truncated (advanced use
only).

new-length

Specify the target size of the
file. It will be rounded up to a multiple of the cluster
size. A suffix of K, M, G, T, P or E may be appended to mean
a multiplicative factor of a power of 1000. Similarly a
suffix of Ki, Mi, Gi, Ti, Pi or Ei may be appended to mean a
multiplicative factor of a power of 1024.

EXAMPLES

Resize to 100MB
the file database.db located in the Data directory which is
at the root of an NTFS file system.

ntfstruncate
/dev/sda1 Data/database.db 100M
