NAME
       Mouse::Exporter - make an import() and unimport() just like Mouse.pm

VERSION
       This document describes Mouse version v2.5.10

SYNOPSIS
           package MyApp::Mouse;

           use Mouse ();
           use Mouse::Exporter;

           Mouse::Exporter->setup_import_methods(
             as_is => [ 'has_rw', 'other_sugar', \&Some::Random::thing ],
             also  => 'Mouse',
           );

           sub has_rw {
               my $meta = caller->meta;
               my ( $name, %options ) = @_;
               $meta->add_attribute(
                 $name,
                 is => 'rw',
                 %options,
               );
           }

           # then later ...
           package MyApp::User;

           use MyApp::Mouse;

           has 'name';
           has_rw 'size';
           thing;

           no MyApp::Mouse;

DESCRIPTION
       This module encapsulates the exporting of sugar functions in a
       "Mouse.pm"-like manner. It does this by building custom "import",
       "unimport" methods for your module, based on a spec you provide.

       Note that "Mouse::Exporter" does not provide the "with_meta" option,
       but you can easily get the metaclass by "caller->meta" as "SYNOPSIS"
       shows.

METHODS
   "setup_import_methods( ARGS )"
   "build_import_methods( ARGS ) -> (\&import, \&unimport)"
