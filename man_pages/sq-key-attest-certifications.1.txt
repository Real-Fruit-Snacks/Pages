NAME

sq key
attest-certifications - Attest to third-party
certifications

SYNOPSIS

sq key
attest-certifications [OPTIONS] KEY

DESCRIPTION

Attest to
third-party certifications allowing for their
distribution.

To prevent
certificate flooding attacks, modern key servers prevent
uncontrolled distribution of third-party certifications on
certificates. To make the key holder the sovereign over the
information over what information is distributed with the
certificate, the key holder needs to explicitly attest to
third-party certifications.

After the
attestation has been created, the certificate has to be
distributed, e.g. by uploading it to a key server.
