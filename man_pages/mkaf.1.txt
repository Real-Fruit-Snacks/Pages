NAME

mkaf -
create a Performance Co-Pilot archive folio

SYNOPSIS

$PCP_BINADM_DIR/mkaf
[-?] [findopts] filename ...

DESCRIPTION

A collection of
one or more Performance Co-Pilot (see PCPIntro(1))
archives may be combined with mkaf to produce a PCP
archive folio and the associated archive folio control file.
Some PCP tools use mkaf to create archive folios,
e.g. the &rsquo;&rsquo;record&rsquo;&rsquo; facility in the
pmchart(1) and pmview(1) tools, to facilitate
playback with pmafm(1).

mkaf
processes each filename argument, and if this is a
component file from a PCP archive that archive is added to
the folio.

If
filename is a directory, then this is searched
recursively using find(1). Any filename
argument beginning with a &rsquo;&rsquo;-&rsquo;&rsquo; is
assumed to be a find(1) command line option
(findopts); the default is -follow if no
findopts are specified.

The first named
archive in the folio is assumed to be associated with the
default host for any tool that tries to replay multiple
archives from the folio.

The folio
control file is written to standard output, and has the
following format.

1.

The first line contains the word PCPFolio.

2.

The second line contains the tag Version:
followed by the format version number (currently 1).

3.

For subsequent lines, blank lines and lines beginning
with &rsquo;&rsquo;#&rsquo;&rsquo; are ignored.

4.

The line beginning with the tag Created:
documents where and when the folio was created.

5.

The line beginning with the tag Creator:
identifies the tool which created the folio (and is assumed
to know how to replay the archive folio). If present, the
second argument is the name of a configuration file that the
creator tool could use to replay the archive folio, e.g.
with the replay command for pmafm(1). In the
case of mkaf (unlike pmchart(1) or
pmview(1)) there is no knowledge of the contents of
the archives, so the &rsquo;&rsquo;creator&rsquo;&rsquo;
cannot replay the archive, however pmchart(1) is able
to replay any archive, and so this tool is identified as the
Creator: for archive folios created by
mkaf(1). 

6.

This is then followed by one or more lines beginning
with the tag Archive: followed by the hostname and
base name of the archive.

For example

$ mkaf mydir/gonzo 
might produce the following folio control file.

PCPFolio 
Version: 1 
# use pmafm(1) to process this PCP archive folio

PCP ENVIRONMENT

Environment
variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On
each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains
the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).
