       --verbose {on|off}
              enable/disable verbose mode that shows diagnostic messages about

              control the printing of run  time  information  to  assist  with
              troubleshooting, or further development of this tool; on gives a
              modest amount of information; s, m, l, or xl gives an increasing
              amount of information and off disables the printing of debug in‐
