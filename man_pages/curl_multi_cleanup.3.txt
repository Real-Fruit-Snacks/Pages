NAME

curl_multi_cleanup
- close down a multi session

SYNOPSIS

#include

CURLMcode
curl_multi_cleanup( CURLM *multi_handle );

DESCRIPTION

Cleans up and
removes a whole multi stack. It does not free or touch any
individual easy handles in any way - they still need to be
closed individually, using the usual
curl_easy_cleanup(3) way. The order of cleaning up
should be:

1 -
curl_multi_remove_handle(3) before any easy handles
are cleaned up

2 -
curl_easy_cleanup(3) can now be called independently
since the easy handle is no longer connected to the multi
handle

3 -
curl_multi_cleanup(3) should be called when all easy
handles are removed

Passing in a
NULL pointer in multi_handle will make this function
return CURLM_BAD_HANDLE immediately with no other
action.

RETURN VALUE

CURLMcode type,
general libcurl multi interface error code. On success,
CURLM_OK is returned.
