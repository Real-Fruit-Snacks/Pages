RLOGIN(1) BSD General Commands Manual RLOGIN(1)

NAME

rlogin &mdash; remote
login

SYNOPSIS

rlogin
[&minus;468DEd] [&minus;e char]
[&minus;i localname]
[&minus;l username] host

DESCRIPTION

The rlogin utility starts
a terminal session on a remote host host.

The
rlogin utility first attempts to use the Kerberos
authorization mechanism, described below. If the remote host
does not support Kerberos the standard Berkeley
rhosts authorization mechanism is used.

The following
options are available:

&minus;4

Use IPv4
addresses only.

&minus;6

Use IPv6
addresses only.

&minus;8

Allow an
eight-bit input data path at all times; otherwise parity
bits are stripped except when the remote side&rsquo;s stop
and start characters are other than ^S/^Q.

&minus;D

Set the
TCP_NODELAY socket option which can improve interactive
response at the expense of increased network load.

&minus;E

Stop any
character from being recognized as an escape character. When
used with the &minus;8 option, this provides a
completely transparent connection.

&minus;d

Turn on socket
debugging (see setsockopt(2)) on the TCP sockets used for
communication with the remote host.

&minus;e

Allow user
specification of the escape character, which is
&rsquo;&rsquo;~&rsquo;&rsquo; by default. This specification
may be as a literal character, or as an octal value in the
form \nnn.

&minus;i

Allow the
caller to specify a different local name to be used for
authentication. This option is restricted to processes with
uid 0.

&minus;l

Specify a
different username for the remote login. If this
option is not specified, your local username will be
used.

A line of the
form &rsquo;&rsquo;&lang;

escape char &rang; .&rsquo;&rsquo; disconnects from the
remote host. Similarly, the line &rsquo;&rsquo;&lang; 
escape char &rang; ^Z&rsquo;&rsquo; will suspend the
rlogin session, and &rsquo;&rsquo;&lang; 
escape char &rang; &lang; 
delayed-suspend char &rang; &rsquo;&rsquo; suspends the
send portion of the rlogin session, but allows output
from the remote system. By default, the tilde
(&rsquo;&rsquo;~&rsquo;&rsquo;) character is the escape
character, and normally control-Y
(&rsquo;&rsquo;^Y&rsquo;&rsquo;) is the delayed-suspend
character.

All echoing
takes place at the remote site, so that (except for delays)
the rlogin is transparent. Flow control via ^S/^Q and
flushing of input and output on interrupts are handled
properly.

KERBEROS
AUTHENTICATION

Each user may have a private
authorization list in the file .klogin in their home
directory. Each line in this file should contain a Kerberos
principal name of the form principal.instance@realm.
If the originating user is authenticated to one of the
principals named in .klogin, access is granted to the
account. The principal accountname.@localrealm is
granted access if there is no .klogin file. Otherwise
a login and password will be prompted for on the remote
machine as in login(1). To avoid certain security problems,
the .klogin file must be owned by the remote
user.

If Kerberos
authentication fails, a warning message is printed and the
standard Berkeley rlogin is used instead.

ENVIRONMENT

The following environment
variable is utilized by rlogin:

TERM

Determines the
user&rsquo;s terminal type.

HISTORY

The rlogin command
appeared in 4.2BSD.

IPv6 support was
added by WIDE/KAME project.

BUGS

The rlogin utility will
be replaced by telnet(1) in the near future.

More of the
environment should be propagated.
