DESCRIPTION

fpit is
an Xorg input driver for Fujitsu Stylistic Tablet PCs.

The fpit
driver functions as a pointer input device, and may be used
as the X server’s core pointer.

SUPPORTED HARDWARE

This driver
supports the touchscreen of the Stylistic LT and (with
special options) of the Stylistic 500, 1000 and 2300.

Under Linux the
Fujitsus serial port is not, by default, detected. Therefore
the following must be added to one of your start-up scripts.
(Either one of the X scripts, or to rc.local or similar).

setserial /dev/ttyS3 autoconfig 
setserial /dev/ttyS3 IRQ 15 baud_base 115200 port
0xfce8

This driver now
supports Stylistic 3400 (and possibly other passive-pen
systems) with a special "Passive" paramter.
Try this serial configuration for the 3400: 
setserial /dev/ttyS3 autoconfig 
setserial /dev/ttyS3 uart 16450 irq 5 port 0xfd68

CONFIGURATION DETAILS

Please refer to
xorg.conf(5x) for general configuration details and for
options that can be used with all input drivers. This
section only covers configuration details specific to this
driver.

The device
supports the following options:

Option
"MaximumXPosition" "number"

Sets the maximum X position,
use this to calibrate your touchscreen’s right hand
edge.

Option
"MinimumXPosition" "number"

Sets the minimum X position,
use this to calibrate your touchscreen’s left hand
edge.

Option
"MaximumYPosition" "number"

Option "MinimumYPosition"
"number"

Same as for X axis, but for Y
axis.

Option
"InvertX" 
Option "InvertY"

Invert the specified axis.

Option
"SwapXY"

Swap the X and Y axis.

Option
"Rotate" "CW"

Option
"Rotate" "CWW" Manipulate the
invert and swap options to match screen rotations.

Option
"DeviceName" "name"

Option
"DeviceName" "name" sets the name
of the X device.

Option
"AlwaysCore" "on"

enables the sharing of the core
pointer. When this feature is enabled, the device will take
control of the core pointer (and thus will emit core events)
and at the same time will be able, when asked so, to report
extended events. You can use the last available integer
feedback to control this feature. When the value of the
feedback is zero, the feature is disabled. The feature is
enabled for any other value.

Option
"DebugLevel" number

sets the level of debugging
info reported.

Option
"BaudRate" "38400",
"19200" or "9600"
(default)

changes the serial link
speed.

Option
"Passive"

decodes the passive pen.

Example, for
Stylistic LT setup is: 
Section "InputDevice" 
Identifier "mouse0" 
Driver "fpit" 
Option "Device"
"/dev/ttyS3" 
EndSection

And for other
Stylistic devices try: 
Section "InputDevice" 
Identifier "mouse0" 
Driver "fpit" 
Option "Device"
"/dev/ttyS3" 
Option "BaudRate" "19200"

Option "MaximumXPosition"
"6250" 
Option "MaximumYPosition"
"4950" 
Option "MinimumXPosition"
"130" 
Option "MinimumYPosition"
"0" 
Option "InvertY" 
EndSection

For Stylistic
3400: 
Section "InputDevice" 
Identifier "mouse0" 
Driver "fpit" 
Option "Device"
"/dev/ttyS3" 
Option "BaudRate" "9600"

Option "MaximumXPosition"
"4070" 
Option "MaximumYPosition"
"4020" 
Option "MinimumXPosition"
"0" 
Option "MinimumYPosition"
"0" 
Option "Passive" 
Option "SendCoreEvents"
