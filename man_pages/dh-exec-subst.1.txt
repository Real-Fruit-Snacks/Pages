NAME

dh-exec-subst -
Debhelper executable file substition scripts

SYNOPSIS

#!
/usr/bin/dh-exec 
src/libfoo-*.so.*
debian/foo-plugins/usr/lib/foo/${DEB_HOST_MULTIARCH}/

DESCRIPTION

Being a
sub-command of dh-exec(1), this program must not be
ran directly, but through dh-exec, which
automatically runs all available sub-commands if run bare;
or explicitly with dh-exec --with=subst.

It is a wrapper
around the various other substitution helpers, and will pipe
the input file through all the available substitution
helpers. It is up to these scripts to do the actual
work.

When a helper
fails to expand a variable within its input, it will leave
it as-is, so that later in the pipeline it can perhaps be
expanded by another program.

SCRIPTS

dh-exec-subst-env

Substitutes any of the
available, exported environment variables into its input. It
does not do any kind of filtering: whatever is available in
the environment, will be available for substitution, however
unsafe that may be.

${FOO}
and ${env:FOO} both will expand to the environment
variable FOO. Only the env form will error if
the variable is unset, in keeping with debhelper(7)
convention.

Introduced in
version 0.1, with the env: format added in
0.29.

dh-exec-subst-multiarch

Attempts to expand any of the
variables known to dpkg-architecture(1), mostly
useful for multi-arch support.

The command
will query dpkg-architecture(1) directly, and does
not rely on environment variables set (as the called program
will prefer already set environment variables anyway).

Introduced in
version 0.1.

ENVIRONMENT

DH_EXEC_SCRIPTDIR

Indicates which directory the
command-specific scripts should be sought for. If not
specified, scripts will be searched for in
/usr/share/dh-exec/.

FILES

higher-level program.

The sub-command
