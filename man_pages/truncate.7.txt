NAME

TRUNCATE
&minus; empty a table

SYNOPSIS

TRUNCATE [
TABLE ] name

DESCRIPTION

TRUNCATE
quickly removes all rows from a table. It has the same
effect as an unqualified DELETE but since it does not
actually scan the table it is faster. This is most useful on
large tables.

PARAMETERS

name

The name (optionally
schema-qualified) of the table to be truncated.

NOTES

TRUNCATE
cannot be used if there are foreign-key references to the
table from other tables. Checking validity in such cases
would require table scans, and the whole point is not to do
one.

TRUNCATE
will not run any user-defined ON DELETE triggers that might
exist for the table.

EXAMPLES

Truncate the
table bigtable:

TRUNCATE TABLE
bigtable;

COMPATIBILITY

There is no
TRUNCATE command in the SQL standard.
