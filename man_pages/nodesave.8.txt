NAME

nodesave -
Saves NET/ROM routing information

SYNOPSIS

nodesave [-p
path] [-v] [filename]

DESCRIPTION

Nodesave
saves the contents of the /proc filesystem entries for the
NET/ROM routing tables. The output of the program is in the
form of a Bourne shell script that calls nrparms(8) to
recreate the NET/ROM routing information. If no filename is
given on the command line, the program writes the script to
stdout.

Typically
nodesave would be used when taking a system off-air
so that the NET/ROM routing may be quickly restored when the
system is brought back on-line.

OPTIONS

-p path

Set the path to the nrparms
binary. This only affects the output of the program. Default
is /usr/sbin.

-v

Display the version.

FILES

/proc/net/nr_neigh

/proc/net/nr_nodes

netromd(8), nrparms(8).
