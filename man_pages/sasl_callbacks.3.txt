sasl_callbacks
- Cyrus SASL documentation

SYNOPSIS

#include

DESCRIPTION

sasl_callbacks
are used when the application needs some information from
the application. Common reasons are getting for getting
usernames and passwords. A client MUST specify what
callbacks they support in the
sasl_client_init(3)/sasl_server_init(3) or
sasl_client_new(3)/sasl_server_new(3) calls.
If an authentication mechanism needs a callback that the
application does not state it supports it cannot be
used.

If a callback
has an id parameter that should be checked to make sure you
are giving the appropriate value.

If an
application is using the client side of the library
functions to handle the callbacks are not necessary. Instead
the application may deal with callbacks via
SASL_INTERACT&rsquo;s. See
sasl_client_start(3)/sasl_client_step(3) for
more information.
