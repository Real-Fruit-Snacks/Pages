PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux

NAME
       ferror — test error indicator on a stream

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdio.h>

       int ferror(FILE *stream);

DESCRIPTION
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with  the
       ISO C  standard.  Any  conflict between the requirements described here

       defers to the ISO C standard.

       The  ferror()  function  shall  test the error indicator for the stream
       pointed to by stream.

       The ferror() function shall not change the setting of errno  if  stream
       is valid.

RETURN VALUE
       The  ferror()  function  shall return non-zero if and only if the error
       indicator is set for stream.
