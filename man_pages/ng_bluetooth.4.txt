ng_bluetooth &mdash;
placeholder for global Bluetooth variables

SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION

The ng_bluetooth module
is a placeholder for global Bluetooth variables. All
Bluetooth variables can be examined and changed via
sysctl(8).

Bluetooth
Variables 
Below is the description of default variables. Each
Bluetooth module might add its own variables to the
tree.

net.bluetooth.version

A read-only integer variable
that shows the current version of the Bluetooth stack.

net.bluetooth.hci.command_timeout

A read-write integer variable
that controls the Host Controller Interface (HCI) command
timeout (in seconds), i.e., how long the HCI layer will wait
for the Command_Complete or Command_Status event from a
Bluetooth device.

net.bluetooth.hci.connection_timeout

A read-write integer variable
that controls the HCI connection timeout, i.e. how long the
HCI layer will wait for the Connection_Complete event.
Normally this should not be required as Bluetooth devices
have connection timeout of their own and will send event
back. This timeout is required to ensure that no connection
will stall in case when the HCI transport layer is broken.
Be careful when changing this variable. Make sure you
understand what you are doing.

net.bluetooth.hci.max_neighbor_age

A read-write integer variable
that controls time-to-live (in seconds) for entries in the
HCI neighbor cache. Every time a Bluetooth device performs
an Inquiry operation, the results will be put in cache.
Later when a Bluetooth device establishes a baseband
connection, it will try to find the matching entry in the
cache and use it. This might speed up establishment of the
baseband connection.

net.bluetooth.l2cap.rtx_timeout

A read-write integer variable
that controls the Link Layer Control and Adaptation Protocol
(L2CAP) Retransmission Timeout (RTX) (in seconds). Every
time the L2CAP layer submits a control command, the RTX
timeout is set. The value of the RTX timeout should be
greater or equal to the value of the HCI connection timeout.
Be careful when changing this variable. Make sure you
understand what you are doing.

net.bluetooth.l2cap.ertx_timeout

A read-write integer variable
that controls the L2CAP Extended Retransmission Timeout
(ERTX) (in seconds). In some cases remote peer may respond
with PENDING status to the L2CAP control command. In this
case the L2CAP command timeout is reset to the ERTX timeout
value. The value of the ERTX timeout should be greater or
equal to the value of the RTX timeout. Be careful when
changing this variable. Make sure you understand what you
are doing.
