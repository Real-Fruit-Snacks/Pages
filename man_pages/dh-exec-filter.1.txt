NAME

dh-exec-filter
- Debhelper executable file filtering scripts

SYNOPSIS

#!
/usr/bin/dh-exec 
[hurd-i386 kfreebsd-any] debian/non-linux/some-file
/usr/lib/my-package 
 src/compiler1 /usr/bin

DESCRIPTION

Being a
sub-command of dh-exec(1), this program must not be
ran directly, but through dh-exec, which
automatically runs all available sub-commands if run bare;
or explicitly with dh-exec --with=subst.

It is a wrapper
around the various other filtering helpers, and will pipe
the input file through all the available filtering helpers.
It is up to these scripts to do the actual work.

SCRIPTS

dh-exec-filter-arch

Filters out
lines that are not for the current host architecture (the
architecture the package is being built for). A line can be
pre- or post-fixed with a bracketed list of architectures,
and it will be kept only if building for one of the
architectures.

The filter
supports negation and wildcards, with the same syntax as
dpkg-architecture(1).

Introduced in
version 0.13.

dh-exec-filter-build-profiles

Filters out lines that do not
match the build profiles in effect. One can use the same
syntax as in debian/control files. If any of the
profiles match, the line will be kept, otherwise it gets
filtered out.

If a profile is
specified, but DEB_BUILD_PROFILES is unset, an error
will be thrown.

Introduced in
version 0.13.

dh-exec-filter-comments

Removes commented and empty
lines.

Introduced in
version 0.13.

ENVIRONMENT

DH_EXEC_SCRIPTDIR

Indicates which directory the
command-specific scripts should be sought for. If not
specified, scripts will be searched for in
/usr/share/dh-exec/.

FILES

$DH_EXEC_SCRIPTDIR/dh-exec-filter-*

higher-level program.
