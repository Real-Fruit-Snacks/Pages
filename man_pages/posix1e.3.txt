NAME

posix1e &mdash;
introduction to the POSIX.1e security API

LIBRARY

SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION

The IEEE POSIX.1e specification
never left draft form, but the interfaces it describes are
now widely used despite inherent limitations. Currently,
only a few of the interfaces and features are implemented in
FreeBSD, although efforts are underway to complete the
integration at this time.

POSIX.1e
describes five security extensions to the base POSIX.1 API:
Access Control Lists (ACLs), Auditing, Capabilities,
Mandatory Access Control, and Information Flow Labels.
FreeBSD supports POSIX.1e ACL interfaces, as well as
POSIX.1e-like MAC interfaces. The TrustedBSD Project has
produced but not integrated an implementation of POSIX.1e
Capabilities.

POSIX.1e defines
both syntax and semantics for these features, but fairly
substantial changes are required to implement these features
in the operating system.

As shipped,
FreeBSD 4.0 provides API and VFS support for ACLs, but
not an implementation on any native file system.
FreeBSD 5.0 includes support for ACLs as part of UFS1
and UFS2, as well as necessary VFS support for additional
file systems to export ACLs as appropriate. Available API
calls relating to ACLs are described in detail in
acl(3).

As shipped,
FreeBSD 5.0 includes support for Mandatory Access
Control as well as POSIX.1e-like APIs for label management.
More information on API calls relating to MAC is available
in mac(3).

Additional
patches supporting POSIX.1e features are provided by the
TrustedBSD project:

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

FreeBSD&rsquo;s support for
POSIX.1e interfaces and features is still under development
at this time, and many of these features are considered new
or experimental.

ENVIRONMENT

POSIX.1e assigns security labels
to all objects, extending the security functionality
described in POSIX.1. These additional labels provide
fine-grained discretionary access control, fine-grained
capabilities, and labels necessary for mandatory access
control. POSIX.2c describes a set of userland utilities for
manipulating these labels.

Many of these
services are supported by extended attributes, documented in
extattr(2) and extattr(9). While these APIs are not
documented in POSIX.1e, they are similar in structure.

STANDARDS

POSIX.1e is described in IEEE
POSIX.1e draft 17. Discussion of the draft continues on the
cross-platform POSIX.1e implementation mailing list. To join
this list, see the FreeBSD POSIX.1e implementation page for
more information.

HISTORY

POSIX.1e support was introduced
in FreeBSD 4.0; most of the features are available as
of FreeBSD 5.0. Development continues.

BUGS

Many of these features are
considered new or experimental in FreeBSD 5.0 and
should be deployed with appropriate caution.
