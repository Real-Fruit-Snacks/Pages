LINPROCFS(5) BSD File Formats Manual LINPROCFS(5)

NAME

linprocfs &mdash; Linux
process file system

SYNOPSIS

linproc

/compat/linux/proc

linprocfs

rw 0 0

DESCRIPTION

The Linux process file system,
or linprocfs, emulates a subset of Linux&rsquo;
process file system and is required for the complete
operation of some Linux binaries.

The
linprocfs provides a two-level view of process space.
At the highest level, processes themselves are named,
according to their process ids in decimal, with no leading
zeros. There is also a special node called self which
always refers to the process making the lookup request.

Each node is a
directory containing several files:

exe

A reference to
the vnode from which the process text was read. This can be
used to gain access to the process&rsquo; symbol table, or
to start another copy of the process.

mem

The complete
virtual memory image of the process. Only those addresses
which exist in the process can be accessed. Reads and writes
to this file modify the process. Writes to the text segment
remain private to the process.

Each node is
owned by the process&rsquo;s user, and belongs to that
user&rsquo;s primary group, except for the mem node,
which belongs to the kmem group.

FILES 
/compat/linux/proc

The normal
mount point for the linprocfs.

/compat/linux/proc/cpuinfo

CPU vendor and
model information in human-readable form.

/compat/linux/proc/meminfo
