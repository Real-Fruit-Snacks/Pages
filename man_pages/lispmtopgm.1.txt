NAME
       lispmtopgm - convert a Lisp Machine bitmap file to PGM

SYNOPSIS
       lispmtopgm [lispmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       listpmfile  reads a Lisp Machine bitmap as input and produces a PGM im‐
       age as output.

       This is the file format written by the tv:write-bit-array-file function
       on TI Explorer and Symbolics lisp machines.

       Multi-plane  bitmaps  on  lisp  machines are color; but the Lispm image
       file format does not include a color map, so we  must  treat  it  as  a
       monochrome instead and produce PGM.  This is unfortunate.

OPTIONS
       There  are no command line options defined specifically for lispmtopgm,
       but it recognizes the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm
       (See
        Common Options ⟨index.html#commonoptions⟩ .)

SEE ALSO
       pgmtolispm(1), pgm(1)

LIMITATIONS
       The Lispm bitmap file format is a bit quirky;  Usually the image in the
       file has its width rounded up to the next higher multiple  of  32,  but
       not  always.   If the width is not a multiple of 32, we don't deal with
       it properly, but because of the Lispm microcode, such arrays are proba‐
       bly not image data anyway.

       Also,  the  Lispm code for saving bitmaps has a bug, in that if you are
       writing a bitmap which is not mod32 across, the file may  be  up  to  7
       bits  too  short!   They  round down instead of up, and we don't handle
       this bug gracefully.
