NAME
       Dpkg::Interface::Storable - common methods related to object
       serialization

DESCRIPTION
       Dpkg::Interface::Storable is only meant to be used as parent class for
       other classes. It provides common methods that are all implemented on
       top of two basic methods parse() and output().

BASE METHODS
       Those methods must be provided by the class that wish to inherit from
       Dpkg::Interface::Storable so that the methods provided can work.

       $obj->parse($fh[, $desc])
           This methods initialize the object with the data stored in the
           filehandle. $desc is optional and is a textual description of the
           filehandle used in error messages.

       $string = $obj->output([$fh])
           This method returns a string representation of the object in
           $string and it writes the same string to $fh (if it's defined).

PROVIDED METHODS
       $obj->load($filename, %opts)
           Initialize the object with the data stored in the file. The file
           can be compressed, it will be decompressed on the fly by using a
           Dpkg::Compression::FileHandle object. If $opts{compression} is
           false the decompression support will be disabled. If $filename is
           "-", then the standard input is read (no compression is allowed in
           that case).

       $obj->save($filename, %opts)
           Store the object in the file. If the filename ends with a known
           compression extension, it will be compressed on the fly by using a
           Dpkg::Compression::FileHandle object. If $opts{compression} is
           false the compression support will be disabled. If $filename is
           "-", then the standard output is used (data are written
           uncompressed in that case).

       "$obj"
           Return a string representation of the object.

CHANGES
   Version 1.01 (dpkg 1.19.0)
       New options: The $obj->load() and $obj->save() methods support a new
       compression option.

   Version 1.00 (dpkg 1.15.6)
       Mark the module as public.

1.22.0                            2023-09-06  Dpkg::Interface::Storable(3perl)
