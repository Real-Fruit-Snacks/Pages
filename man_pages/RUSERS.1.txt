RUSERS(1) BSD General Commands Manual RUSERS(1)

NAME

rusers &mdash; who is
logged in to machines on local network

SYNOPSIS

rusers [-al]
[host ...]

DESCRIPTION

The rusers command
produces output similar to who, but for the list of hosts or
all machines on the local network. For each host responding
to the rusers query, the hostname with the names of the
users currently logged on is printed on each line. The
rusers command will wait for one minute to catch late
responders.

The following
options are available:

-a

Print all
machines responding even if no one is currently logged
in.

-l

Print a long
format listing. This includes the user name, host name, tty
that the user is logged in to, the date and time the user
logged in, the amount of time since the user typed on the
keyboard, and the remote host they logged in from (if
applicable).

DIAGNOSTICS 
rusers: RPC: Program not registered

The rpc.rusersd(8) daemon has
not been started on the remote host.

rusers: RPC: Timed out

A communication error occurred.
Either the network is excessively congested, or the
rpc.rusersd(8) daemon has terminated on the remote host.

rusers: RPC: Port mapper failure
- RPC: Timed out

The remote host is not running
the portmapper (see portmap(8) ), and cannot accomodate any
RPC-based services. The host may be down.
