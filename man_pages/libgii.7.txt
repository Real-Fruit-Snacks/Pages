NAME

libgii
&minus; A flexible library for input handling

DESCRIPTION

LibGII is an
input library developed by the GGI Project. Its design
philosophy is similar to LibGGI, which deals with graphics
output. LibGII is based on the concept of input streams,
which virtualize access to the underlying input drivers.
Events from various input devices are abstracted into
easy-to-use structures. LibGII also allows the application
to join streams together, receiving input from an arbitrary
combination of devices.

LibGII is a
separate component from LibGGI, although LibGGI depends on
LibGII for input purposes. (LibGGI&rsquo;s input functions
are simply wrappers for LibGII functions.)

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

The following
outlines the environment variables, intended for the user,
which affect the behaviour of LibGII: 
GII_INPUT

The default input source(s)
and/or filter(s) to use when giiOpen() is called with a NULL
argument. The format is: input:inputargs. Multiple
inputs can be specified by this notation: (i1):(i2)
.... 
Note: This setting does not affect LibGGI visuals
automatically opening inputs. Use the GGI_INPUTx
variable instead.

GII_DEBUG

The debug level for LibGII:

&bull;

0 or unset : debug output is off; debugging is off

&bull;

255 : all debug output is on

You may also
bitwise &rsquo;or&rsquo; any of the following together:

&bull;

2 : debug core

&bull;

32 : misc debugging output

&bull;

64 : debug dynamic library handling

&bull;

128 : debug event handling

GII_DEBUGSYNC

Turn on synchronous debug
output, flushing the output buffers before returning from
DPRINT calls.

GII_CONFDIR

Override compiled-in path to
global config files (Win32 only, but not Cygwin).

Other
environment variables specific to filters and inputs are
documented in the corresponding manual page.
