gettaskid(void);

projid_t
getprojid(void);

DESCRIPTION

The
settaskid() function makes a request of the system to
assign a new task ID to the calling process, changing
the associated project ID to that specified. The
calling process must have superuser privileges to perform
this operation. The flags argument should be either
TASK_NORMAL for a regular task, or TASK_FINAL,
which disallows subsequent settaskid() calls by the
created task.

The
gettaskid() function returns the task ID of
the calling process.

The
getprojid() function returns the project ID of
the calling process.

RETURN VALUES

Upon successful
completion, these functions return the appropriate task or
project ID. Otherwise, &minus;1 is returned and
errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS

The
settaskid() function will fail if: 
EACCES

The invoking task was created
with the TASK_FINAL flag.

EPERM

The effective user of the calling process is not
superuser. 

EINVAL

The given project ID is
not within the valid project ID range.
