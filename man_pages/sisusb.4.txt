DESCRIPTION

sisusb
is an Xorg driver for SiS (Silicon Integrated Systems) video
chips that are connected via a Net2280-based USB dongle. The
driver is not accelerated, but provides support for
colordepths of 8, 16 and 24 bpp as well as Render and other
extensions.

SUPPORTED HARDWARE

The
sisusb driver supports USB video cards based on the
following chipsets:

SiS315E/PRO

The SiS315E/PRO
features two CRT controllers. However, in its USB version,
only the first output, referred to as "CRT1", is
being used.

CONFIGURATION DETAILS

Please refer to
xorg.conf(5) for general configuration details and to sis(4)
for more information. This manpage only covers a subset of
the supported options.

Detailed
information on all supported options can be obtained at
http://www.winischhofer.at/linuxsisusbvga.shtml

Please note
that this driver requires a Linux kernel driver as well
which is included in Linux 2.6.12 and later, as well as
available at the aforementioned website.

The following
driver Options are supported: 
Option "HWCursor"
"boolean"

Enable or disable the hardware
cursor. It is not recommended to disable the hardware cursor
as this will increase the amount of data transferred over
the USB. Default: HWCursor is on.

Option "SWCursor"
"boolean"

The opposite of HWCursor. This
enables or disables the software cursor. This sort of cursor
is slower because the pointer must be painted into the
graphics display. This increases the amount of data
transferred over the USB significantly. Default: SWCursor is
off.

Option "CRT1Gamma"
"boolean"

Enable or disable gamma
correction. Default: Gamma correction is on.

Option
"DisconnectTimeout"
"integer"

This option determines how the
driver will react to a disconnection of the USB device. If
the integer supplied is -1, the driver will abort the X
server immediately upon disconnection. If the value given is
0, the driver will probe for a re-connection every 2 seconds
and in case the device is detected, re-establish the
display. If the value is greater than 0, the driver will do
this re-probing within the given number of seconds and abort
the server if it does not detect the device within this
time-out. Default: 0 (probe forever for device
reconnection).

KNOWN BUGS

none.
