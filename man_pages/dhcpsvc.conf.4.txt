NAME

dhcpsvc.conf
&minus; file containing service configuration parameters for
the DHCP service

DESCRIPTION

The
dhcpsvc.conf file resides in directory
/etc/inet and contains parameters for specifying
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) service
configuration settings, including the type and location of
DHCP data store used.

The description
of the dhcpsvc.conf file in this man page is
informational only. The preferred method of setting or
modifying values within the dhcpsvc.conf file is by
using dhcpconfig(1M) or the dhcpmgr(1M)
utility. Do not edit the dhcpsvc.conf file.

The
dhcpsvc.conf file format is ASCII; comment
lines begin with the crosshatch (#) character.
Parameters consist of a keyword followed by an equals
(=) sign followed by the parameter value, of the
form:

Keyword=Value

The following
Keyword and Value parameters are supported:

BOOTP_COMPAT

String. automatic or
manual. Enables support of BOOTP clients.
Default is no BOOTP. Value selects BOOTP
address allocation method. automatic to support all
BOOTP clients, manual to support only registered
BOOTP clients. server mode only parameter.

CACHE_TIMEOUT

Integer. Number of seconds the
server will cache data from data store. Used to improve
performance. Default is 10 seconds. server mode only
parameter.

CONVER

Integer. Container version.
Used by DHCP administrative tools to identify which version
of the public module is being used to administer the data
store. CONVER should not be changed
manually.

DAEMON_ENABLED

TRUE/FALSE. If
TRUE, the DHCP daemon can be run. If FALSE,
DHCP daemon process will exit immediately if the daemon is
started. Default is TRUE. Generic parameter.

HOSTS_DOMAIN

String. Defines name service
domain that DHCP administration tools use when managing the
hosts table. Valid only when HOSTS_RESOURCE is set to
nisplus or dns.

HOSTS_RESOURCE

String. Defines what name
service resource should be used by the DHCP administration
tools when managing the hosts table. Current valid values
are files, nisplus, and dns.

ICMP_VERIFY

TRUE/FALSE.
Toggles ICMP echo verification of IP addresses.
Default is TRUE. server mode only
parameter.

INTERFACES

String. Comma-separated list of
interface names to listen to. Generic parameter.

LOGGING_FACILITY

Integer. Local facility number
(0-7 inclusive) to log DHCP events to.
Default is not to log transactions. Generic parameter.

OFFER_CACHE_TIMEOUT

Integer. Number of seconds
before OFFER cache timeouts occur. Default is
10 seconds. server mode only parameter.

PATH

Path to DHCP data tables within the data store specified
by the RESOURCE parameter. The value of the PATH
keyword is specific to the RESOURCE.

RELAY_DESTINATIONS

String. Comma-separated list of
host names and/or IP addresses of relay destinations.
relay mode only parameter.

RELAY_HOPS

Integer. Max number of
BOOTP relay hops before packet is dropped. Default is
4. Generic parameter.

RESCAN_INTERVAL

Integer. Number of minutes
between automatic dhcptab rescans. Default is not to
do rescans. server mode only parameter.

RESOURCE

Data store resource used. Use
this parameter to name the public module. See the
PATH keyword in dhcp_modules(5).

RESOURCE_CONFIG

String. This might be used for
a database account name or other authentication or
authorization parameters required by a particular data
store. dhcp_modules(5).

Providers can
use the RESOURCE_CONFIG known as configure by
specifying an optional service provider layer API
function:

int
configure(const char *configp);

If this
function is defined by the public module provider, it is
called during module load time by the private layer, with
the contents of the RESOURCE_CONFIG string acquired
by the administrative interface (in the case of the
dhcpmgr, through the use of a public module-specific
java bean extending the dhcpmgr to provide a
configuration dialog for this information.

RUN_MODE

server or relay.
Selects daemon run mode. Default is server.

SECONDARY_SERVER_TIMEOUT

Integer. The number of seconds
a secondary server will wait for a primary server to respond
before responding itself. Default is 20 seconds. This
is a server 
mode only parameter.

UPDATE_TIMEOUT

Integer. Number of minutes to
wait for a response from the DNS server before timing out.
If this parameter is present, the DHCP daemon will update
DNS on behalf of DHCP clients, and will wait the number of
seconds specified for a response before timing out. You can
use UPDATE_TIMEOUT without specifying a number to
enable DNS updates with the default timeout of 15 seconds.
If this parameter is not present, the DHCP daemon will not
update DNS for DHCP clients.

VERBOSE

TRUE/FALSE.
Toggles verbose mode, determining amount of status and error
messages reported by the daemon. Default is FALSE.
Set to TRUE only for debugging. Generic
parameter.
