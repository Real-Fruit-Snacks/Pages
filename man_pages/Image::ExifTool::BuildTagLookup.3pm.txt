NAME
       Image::ExifTool::BuildTagLookup - Build ExifTool tag lookup tables

DESCRIPTION
       This module is used to generate the tag lookup tables in
       Image::ExifTool::TagLookup.pm and tag name documentation in
       Image::ExifTool::TagNames.pod, as well as HTML tag name documentation.
       It is used before each new ExifTool release to update the lookup tables
       and documentation, but it is not used otherwise.  It also performs some
       validation and consistency checks on the tag tables.

SYNOPSIS
         use Image::ExifTool::BuildTagLookup;

         $builder = new Image::ExifTool::BuildTagLookup;

         # update Image::ExifTool::TagLookup
         $ok = $builder->WriteTagLookup('lib/Image/ExifTool/TagLookup.pm');

         # update the tag name documentation
         $ok = $builder->WriteTagNames('lib/Image/ExifTool/TagNames.pod','html');

         # print some statistics
         my $count = $$builder{COUNT};
         foreach (sort keys %$count) {
             printf "%5d %s\n", $$count{$_}, $_;
         }

MEMBER VARIABLES
       PRESERVE_DATE
           Flag to preserve "Last revised" date in HTML files.  Set before
           calling WriteTagNames().

       COUNT
           Reference to hash containing counting statistics.  Keys are the
           descriptions, and values are the numerical counts.  Valid after
           BuildTagLookup object is created, but additional statistics are
           added by WriteTagNames().

       WRITE_PSEUDO
           Returned list of writable pseudo tags.
