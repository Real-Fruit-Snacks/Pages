NAME
       sane-coolscan3 - SANE backend for Nikon Coolscan film scanners

DESCRIPTION
       The  sane-coolscan3 library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy)
       backend that provides access to Nikon  Coolscan  film  scanners.   Some
       functions  of  this backend should be considered beta-quality software.
       Most functions have been stable for a long time, but of course new  de‐
       velopment  can  not  and will not function properly from the very first
       day.

       At present, the following scanners are known to work with this backend:

              Model:                       Connection Type
              ---------------------------  -------------------
              LS-30 (Coolscan III)         SCSI
              LS-40 ED (Coolscan IV)       USB
              LS-50 ED (Coolscan V)        USB
              LS-2000                      SCSI
              LS-4000 ED                   IEEE 1394
              LS-8000 ED                   IEEE 1394

       Please send mail to sane-devel@alioth-lists.debian.net to  report  suc‐
       cesses or failures.

OPTIONS
       The options the backend supports can either be selected through command
       line options to programs like scanimage(1) or through GUI  elements  in
       xscanimage(1) or xsane(1).

       Valid command line options and their syntax can be listed by using:

              scanimage --help -d coolscan3:<interface>:<device>

       where  <interface>  and  <device> specify the device in question, as in
       the configuration file (see next section). The -d parameter and its ar‐
       gument  can be omitted to obtain information on the first scanner iden‐
       tified. Use the command:

              scanimage -L

       to list all devices recognized by your SANE installation.

       The options should be fully described by the  description  or  tooltips
       given  by frontend. Here is a description of some of the most important
       options, in the syntax with which they  must  be  supplied  to  scanim‐
       age(1):

       --frame <n>
              This  option specifies which frame to operate on, if a motorized
              film strip feeder or APS adapter are used. The frame number  <n>
              ranges from 1 to the number of frames available, which is sensed
              each time the backend is  initialized  (usually  each  time  you
              start the frontend).

       --subframe <x>
              This  option shifts the scan window by the specified amount (de‐
              fault unit is mm).

       --infrared=yes/no
              If set to "yes", the scanner will  read  the  infrared  channel,
              thus  allowing defect removal in software. The infrared image is
              read during a second scan, with no options altered. The  backend
              must  not be restarted between the scans.  If you use scanimage,
              perform a batch scan with --batch-count=2 to obtain the  IR  in‐
              formation.

       --depth <n>
              Here <n> can either be 8 or the maximum number of bits supported
              by the scanner (10, 12, or 14). It specifies whether or not  the
              scanner  reduces the scanned data to 8 bits before sending it to
              the backend. If 8 bits are used, some information and thus image
              quality  is  lost, but the amount of data is smaller compared to
              higher depths. Also, many imaging  programs  and  image  formats
              cannot handle depths greater than 8 bits.

       --autofocus
              Perform  autofocus  operation. Unless otherwise specified by the
              other options ( --focus-on-centre and friends), focusing is per‐
              formed on the centre of the selected scan area.

       --ae-wb

       --ae   Perform  a  pre-scan to calculate exposure values automatically.
              --ae-wb will maintain the white balance, while --ae will  adjust
              each channel separately.

       --exposure
              Multiply  all  exposure times with this value. This allows expo‐
              sure correction without modifying white balance.

       --load Load the next slide when using the  slide  loader  (SF-200  bulk
              loader only).

       --eject
              Eject  the  film  strip  or  mounted  slide when using the slide
              loader.

       --reset
              Reset scanner. The scanner will perform the same action as  when
              power  is  turned  on:  it  will  eject the film strip (with the
              SF-200 bulk loader) and calibrate itself. Use this whenever  the
              scanner  refuses  to  load a film strip properly, as a result of
              which --eject does not work.

CONFIGURATION FILE
       The configuration file  /etc/sane.d/coolscan3.conf  specifies  the  de‐
       vice(s) that the backend will use. Owing to the nature of the supported
       connection types SCSI, USB, and IEEE 1394,  the  default  configuration
       file  supplied  with  the  SANE  distribution should work without being
       edited.

       Each line in the configuration file is either of the  following,  where
       all entries are case-sensitive:

       blank or starting with a '#' character
              These  lines  are  ignored, thus '#' can be used to include com‐
              ments.

       containing only the word "auto"
              This instructs the backend to probe for a  scanner  by  scanning
              the  buses  for  devices with known identifiers. This is the de‐
              fault action when no configuration file is present.

       a line of the form <interface>:<device>
              Here <interface> can be one of "scsi" or "usb", and <device>  is
              the  device file of the scanner. Note that IEEE 1394 devices are
              handled by the SBP-2 module in the kernel and appear to SANE  as
              SCSI devices.

FILES
       /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-coolscan3.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-coolscan3.so
              The shared library implementing this backend (present on systems
              that support dynamic loading).

       /etc/sane.d/coolscan3.conf
              Configuration file for this backend, read each time the  backend
              is initialized.

ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_DEBUG_COOLSCAN3
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this en‐
              vironment variable controls the debug level  for  this  backend.
              E.g.,  a  value  of 128 requests all debug output to be printed.
              Smaller levels reduce verbosity.

BUGS
       Currently, the SANE protocol does not allow automatically updating  op‐
       tions whenever the hardware changes. Thus the number of choices for the
       --frame option will be fixed when the backend is  initialized  (usually
       when  the  user  runs the frontend). In particular, if there is no film
       strip in the automatic film strip feeder when the backend  is  initial‐
       ized,  the --frame option will not appear at all.  Also, restarting the
       frontend after swapping film adapters is strongly recommended.

       Linux kernels prior to 2.4.19 had a patch that truncated  INQUIRY  data
       from IEEE 1394 scanners to 36 bytes, discarding vital information about
       the scanner. The IEEE 1394 models therefore only work  with  2.4.19  or
       later.

       No real bugs currently known, please report any to the SANE developers'
       list.
