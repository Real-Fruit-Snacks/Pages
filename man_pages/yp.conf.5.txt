NAME

yp.conf - NIS
binding configuration file

DESCRIPTION

The file
/etc/yp.conf is read from ypbind(8) at startup or
when receiving signal SIGHUP. The entries are used for the
initial binding. Valid entries are

domain
nisdomain server hostname

Use server hostname for
the domain nisdomain. You could have more then one
entry of this type for a single domain.

domain
nisdomain broadcast

Use broadcast on the local net
for domain nisdomain.

ypserver
hostname

Use server hostname for
the local domain.

broadcast

If no other server is given or
all of them are not reachable, try a broadcast call for the
default domain to find a server.

hostname
can either be an IP address or the system's DNS name. If it
is the system's DNS name, this name needs to be resolveable
without the help of NIS, before NIS is used.

If for a
specific domain the broadcast option and fixed server are
given, ypbind-mt tries at first the given servers
before falling back to broadcasting for a running
server.
