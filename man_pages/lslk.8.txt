NAME

lslk &minus;
list local locks

SYNOPSIS

lslk [
&minus;abhnOvw ] [ &minus;i i ] [
&minus;k k ] [ &minus;p p ] [
&minus;S [t] ] [ paths ]

DESCRIPTION

Lslk
revision 1.29 lists information about locks held on files
with local inodes on systems running the following UNIX
dialects:

AIX 3.2.5, 4.1.4, 4.2[.1], and AIX 4.3[.[12]]

DEC OSF/1, Digital UNIX, and Tru64 UNIX [2345].[01] and
3.2 

Linux

SCO OpenDesktop or OpenServer 3.0 and 5.0.[0245]

Sequent PTX 2.1.9, 4.2.1, 4.3, and 4.4

Solaris 2.[345], 2.5.1, 2.6, 7, and 8 (excluding
Veritas 

VxFS local files)

SunOS 4.1.3

The lock may
belong to a process on the local system or to a process on
an NFS client system to which the local system is an NFS
server. Notes: Linux and PTX 2.1.9 lslk don&rsquo;t
report on locks held by NFS clients; Solaris lslk
won&rsquo;t report locks held on local Veritas VxFS
files.

OPTIONS

In the absence
of any options, lslk lists all locks associated with
the local files of the system.

When selection
options are specified, the listing of all locks is disabled,
and the selection options are ORed together. Only locks
meeting any selection criterion are listed.

When the
&minus;a option is specified, the listing of all
locks is disabled, and the selection options are ANDed
together. Only locks that meet all selection criteria are
listed.

&minus;a

This option causes list selection options to be ANDed,
as described above.

&minus;b

This option causes lslk to avoid kernel functions
that might block &minus; lstat(2),
readlink(2), and stat(2).

See the
BLOCKS AND TIMEOUTS and AVOIDING KERNEL BLOCKS
sections for information on using this option.

&minus;i i

This option selects the listing
of locks whose owning process is on the Internet host whose
name or network address is i.

Multiple
addresses may be declared with multiple &minus;i
i options.

&minus;k k

This option specifies k
as an alternate to the default kernel name list file path.
The default kernel name list file path is listed in the
&minus;h help output.

It may be
necessary to specify an alternate kernel name list path when
the file at the default path isn&rsquo;t the booted kernel
-- e.g., the default is /vmunix, but the booted
kernel file is /vmunix.new.

Unless
lslk accesses the correct kernel name list file, it
may derive incorrect addresses for symbols in kernel memory,
causing it to fail.

&minus;n

This option inhibits the
conversion of network host names to network addresses and
the conversion of network addresses to network host
names. 

This option may
be useful when the host name to address translation service
(e.g., the Domain Name Server) is slow or inoperative.

If you use this
option on hosts whose kernel lock table contains only host
names &minus; e.g., SCO or Solaris &minus; or you use this
option and also select the listing of locks by an Internet
network address with the &minus;i i option,
lslk will not be able to locate any locks with the
specified network address, nor will it be able to report
network addresses in its output. The &minus;n option
inhibits the necessary conversion of kernel lock table host
names to network addresses.

&minus;O

This option directs lslk
to bypass the strategy it uses to avoid being blocked by
some kernel operations &minus; i.e., doing them in forked
child processes. See the BLOCKS AND TIMEOUTS and
AVOIDING KERNEL BLOCKS sections for more information
on kernel operations that may block lslk.

&minus;p p

This option selects the listing of locks whose owning
process IDentification (PID) numbers are in the
comma&minus;separated list, p.

&minus;S [t]

This option specifies an optional time-out seconds value
for kernel functions &minus; lstat(2),
readlink(2), and stat(2) &minus; that might
otherwise deadlock. The minimum for t is two; the
default, fifteen; when no value is specified, the default is
used. 

See the
BLOCKS AND TIMEOUTS section for more information.

&minus;v

When this option is specified,
lslk lists version information &minus; i.e., where,
when and how it was constructed.

&minus;w

This option suppresses non&minus;fatal warning
messages. 

paths

This option specifies a list of file path names for
which lslk is to list lock information.

OUTPUT

Lslk
lists the information for each lock on a separate line in
the following columns. (The columns are dynamically
sized.)

SRC

indicates the source of the
process holding the lock.

If the source
is a local process, its command name is displayed, or
&rsquo;&rsquo;(unknown)&rsquo;&rsquo; if the command name
can&rsquo;t be determined.

If the source
is a remote process, the host name or network number where
the remote process executes is displayed.

PID

is the Process IDentification
number of the process holding the lock.

DEV

is the device (major and minor numbers) on which the
locked file resides.

INUM

is the inode number of the locked file.

SZ

is the size of the locked file.

TY

is the lock type:

r read;

rw

read and write;

w

write;

?

unknown.

M

is the mandatory state of the
lock: 0 if none; 1 if set. (See chmod(1)).

ST

is the relative byte offset of the lock.

WH

is the starting offset
(&rsquo;&rsquo;whence&rsquo;&rsquo;) of the lock.

END

is the ending offset of the lock.

LEN

is the length of the lock.

NAME

is the name of the locked file, if it was specified as a
path argument.

If there is no
path argument name, then the mount point and device
paths of the file system on which the locked file resides
are displayed.

BLOCKS AND TIMEOUTS

Lslk can
be blocked by some kernel functions that it uses &minus;
lstat(2), readlink(2), and stat(2).
These functions are stalled in the kernel, for example, when
the hosts where mounted NFS file systems reside become
inaccessible.

Lslk
attempts to break these blocks with timers and child
processes, but the techniques are not wholly reliable. When
lslk does manage to break a block, it will report the
break with an error message. The messages may be suppressed
with the &minus;w option.

The default
timeout value may be displayed with the &minus;h
option, and it may be changed with the &minus;S
[t] option. The minimum for t is two seconds,
but you should avoid small values, since slow system
responsiveness can cause short timeouts to expire
unexpectedly and perhaps stop lslk before it can
produce any output.

When
lslk has to break a block during its access of
mounted file system information, it normally continues,
although with less information available to display about
open files.

Lslk can
also be directed to avoid the protection of timers and child
processes when using the kernel functions that might block
by specifying the &minus;O option. While this will
allow lslk to start up with less overhead, it exposes
lslk completely to the kernel situations that might
block it. Use this option cautiously.

AVOIDING KERNEL BLOCKS

You can use the
&minus;b option to tell lslk to avoid using
kernel functions that would block. Some cautions apply.

First, using
this option usually requires that your system supply
alternate device numbers in place of the device numbers that
lslk would normally obtain with the lstat(2)
and stat(2) kernel functions. See the ALTERNATE
DEVICE NUMBERS section for more information on alternate
device numbers.

Second, you
can&rsquo;t specify the names of files you want
lslk to locate locks for unless they&rsquo;re file
system names. This is because lslk needs to know the
device and inode numbers of files listed with names
in the lslk options, and the &minus;b option
prevents lslk from obtaining them. Moreover, since
lslk only has device numbers for the file systems
that have alternates, its ability to locate locks on file
systems depends completely on the availability and accuracy
of the alternates. If no alternates are available, or if
they&rsquo;re incorrect, lslk won&rsquo;t be able to
locate locks on the named file systems.

Third, if the
names of your file system directories that lslk
obtains from your system&rsquo;s mount table are symbolic
links, lslk won&rsquo;t be able to resolve the links.
This is because the &minus;b option causes
lslk to avoid the kernel readlink(2) function
it uses to resolve symbolic links.

Finally, using
the &minus;b option causes lslk to issue
warning messages when it needs to use the kernel functions
that the &minus;b option directs it to avoid. You can
suppress these messages by specifying the &minus;w
option, but if you do, you won&rsquo;t see the alternate
device numbers reported in the warning messages.

ALTERNATE DEVICE NUMBERS

On some
dialects, when lslk has to break a block because it
can&rsquo;t get information about a mounted file system via
the lstat(2) and stat(2) kernel functions, or
because you specified the &minus;b option,
lslk can obtain some of the information it needs
&minus; the device number and possibly the file system type
&minus; from the system mount table. When that is possible,
lslk will report the device number it obtained. (You
can suppress the report by specifying the &minus;w
option.)

You can assist
this process if your mount table is supported with an
/etc/mtab or /etc/mnttab file that contains an
options field by adding a
&rsquo;&rsquo;dev=xxxx&rsquo;&rsquo; field for mount points
that do not have one in their options strings.

The
&rsquo;&rsquo;xxxx&rsquo;&rsquo; portion of the field is the
hexadecimal value of the file system&rsquo;s device number.
(Consult the st_dev field of the output of the
lstat(2) and stat(2) functions for the
appropriate values for your file systems.) Here&rsquo;s an
example from a Solaris 2.5 /etc/mnttab for a UFS file
system:

... ufs
suid,rw,dev=80001f ...

Some dialects
that do not use an ASCII /etc/mtab or
/etc/mnttab file for the mount table may still
provide an alternative device number in their internal mount
tables. This includes AIX, DEC OSF/1, Digital UNIX, and
Tru64 UNIX. Lslk knows how to obtain the alternative
device number for these dialects and uses it when its
attempt to lstat(2) or stat(2) the file system
is blocked.

If you&rsquo;re
not sure your dialect supplies alternate device numbers for
file systems from its mount table, use this lslk
incantation to see if it reports any alternate device
numbers:

lslk -b

Look for
standard error file warning messages that begin
&rsquo;&rsquo;assuming "dev=xxxx" from
...&rsquo;&rsquo;.

DIAGNOSTICS

Errors are
identified with messages on the standard error file.

Lslk
returns a one (1) if an error was detected or if it
couldn&rsquo;t list lock information for all the
names that were specified.

EXAMPLES

To list all
locks, use:

lslk

To list locks
from the host &rsquo;&rsquo;klaatu&rsquo;&rsquo; in the
local domain, use:

lslk -i
klaatu

To list locks
from the hosts helios.cc.purdue.edu and vic1.cc.purdue.edu,
use:

lslk -i
helios.cc.purdue.edu -i vic1.cc.purdue.edu

To list locks
held by processes 1234 and 56789, use:

lslk -p
1234,56789

To list all
locks held by process 1234 on host klaatu, use:

lslk -p 1234 -a
-i klaatu

PERMISSION

Lslk
must have permission to access the system memory files
&minus; e.g., /dev/kmem and /dev/mem.
Permission to do that is granted when the lslk
process is run from a root shell, or when its
&rsquo;&rsquo;setgid&rsquo;&rsquo; group matches the group
(e.g., &rsquo;&rsquo;sys&rsquo;&rsquo;) that can read the
system memory files.

BUGS

Perhaps it
should be possible to specify the host on which a search
target PID is located.

DEC OSF/1,
Digital UNIX, and Tru64 UNIX lslk won&rsquo;t find
locks applied with the flock(2) function. It will
find locks applied with the fcntl(2) and
lockf(3) functions.

Linux
lslk will not report locks held by NFS clients. It
may have difficulty reporting locks held on dynamic inodes
(e.g., for the Win-95 file system type, smbfs).

Solaris
lslk won&rsquo;t find locks held on local Veritas
VxFS files by local or remote processes.

FILES

/dev/kmem

kernel virtual memory device

/dev/mem

physical memory device
