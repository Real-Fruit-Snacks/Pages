NAME
       srftopam - convert a SRF image file to Netpbm images

SYNOPSIS
       srftopam [-verbose] [netpbmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       srftopam  reads  a  SRF  image file as input and produces a multi-image
       stream of PAM images as output.

       This program performs the inverse of the conversion that pamtosrf does.
       See  that program's manual for more information about SRF and the rela‐
       tionship between the SRF and Netpbm representation of the images.

       netpbmfile is the input stream, which defaults to Standard Input.  Out‐
       put is always on Standard Output.

OPTIONS
       In  addition  to  the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm
       (most notably -quiet, see
        Common Options ⟨index.html#commonoptions⟩ ), srftopam  recognizes  the
       following command line option:

       -verbose
              Issue  informational messages about the input and the conversion
              process.
