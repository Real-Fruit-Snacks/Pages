NAME

toolbox.conf -
Toolbox configuration file

DESCRIPTION

Persistently
overrides the default behaviour of toolbox(1). The
syntax is TOML and the names of the options match their
command line counterparts. Currently, the only supported
section is general.

OPTIONS

distro =
"DISTRO"

Create a
toolbox container for a different operating system DISTRO
than the host. Cannot be used with image.

image =
"NAME"

Change the NAME
of the image used to create the toolbox container. This is
useful for creating containers from custom-built images.
Cannot be used with distro and
release.

If NAME does
not contain a registry, the local image storage will be
consulted, and if itâ€™s not present there then it will
be pulled from a suitable remote registry.

release
= "RELEASE"

Create a
toolbox container for a different operating system RELEASE
than the host. Cannot be used with image.

FILES

The following
locations are looked up in increasing order of priority:

/etc/containers/toolbox.conf

This is meant
to be provided by the operating system distributor or the
system administrator, and affects all users on the host.

Fields
specified here can be overridden by any of the files
below.

$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/containers/toolbox.conf

This is meant
for user-specific changes. Fields specified here override
any of the files above.

EXAMPLES

default operating system distro:

[general] 
distro = "fedora" 
release = "36"

Override the
default image:

[general] 
image =
"registry.fedoraproject.org/fedora-toolbox:36"
