DESCRIPTION

After a call to
either pmdaDaemon(3) or pmdaDSO(3) to
initialize the pmdaInterface structure, if the caller
needs to relocate or move the structure for any reason then
pmdaInterfaceMoved needs to be called with the new
base address of the pmdaInterface routine as
specified by dispatch.

pmdaInterfaceMoved
will re-establish the internal integrity of the
pmdaInterface structure at the new location before
any other routine in libpcp_pmda called.

CAVEAT

The PMDA must
be using PMDA_INTERFACE_2 or later.
