NAME
       Font::TTF::Glyf - The Glyf data table

DESCRIPTION
       This is a stub table. The real data is held in the loca table. If you
       want to get a glyf look it up in the loca table as
       "$f-"{'loca'}{'glyphs'}[$num]>. It will not be here!

       The difference between reading this table as opposed to the loca table
       is that reading this table will cause updated glyphs to be written out
       rather than just copying the glyph information from the input file.
       This causes font writing to be slower. So read the glyf as opposed to
       the loca table if you want to change glyf data. Read the loca table
       only if you are just wanting to read the glyf information.

       This class is used when writing the glyphs though.

METHODS
   $t->read
       Reads the "loca" table instead!

   $t->out($fh)
       Writes out all the glyphs in the parent's location table, calculating a
       new output location for each one.

   $t->out_xml($context, $depth)
       Outputs all the glyphs in the glyph table just where they are supposed
       to be output!

   $t->XML_start($context, $tag, %attrs)
       Pass control to glyphs as they occur

   $t->XML_end($context, $tag, %attrs)
       Collect up glyphs and put them into the loca table
