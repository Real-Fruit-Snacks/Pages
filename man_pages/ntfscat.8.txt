NAME

ntfscat - print
NTFS files and streams on the standard output

SYNOPSIS

[options]
device [file]

DESCRIPTION

ntfscat
will read a file or stream from an NTFS volume and display
the contents on the standard output.

The case of the
filename passed to ntfscat is ignored.

OPTIONS

Below is a
summary of all the options that ntfscat accepts.
Nearly all options have two equivalent names. The short name
is preceded by - and the long name is preceded by
--. Any single letter options, that don&rsquo;t take
an argument, can be combined into a single command, e.g.
-fv is equivalent to -f -v. Long named options
can be abbreviated to any unique prefix of their name.

-a, --attribute TYPE

Display the contents of a
particular attribute type. By default, the unnamed $DATA
attribute will be shown. The attribute can be specified by a
number in decimal or hexadecimal, or by name.

Notes
The attribute names may be given without the leading $
symbol. 
If you use the $ symbol, you must quote the name to prevent
the shell interpreting the name.

-n,
--attribute-name NAME

Display this named attribute,
stream.

-i, --inode
NUM

Specify a file by its inode
number instead of its name.

-f, --force

This will override some
sensible defaults, such as not using a mounted volume. Use
this option with caution.

-h, --help

Show a list of options with a
brief description of each one.

-q, --quiet

Suppress some
debug/warning/error messages.

-V, --version

Show the version number,
copyright and license ntfscat.

-v, --verbose

Display more
debug/warning/error messages.

EXAMPLES

Display the
contents of a file in the root of an NTFS volume.

ntfscat
/dev/hda1 boot.ini

Display the
contents of a file in a subdirectory of an NTFS volume.

ntfscat
/dev/hda1 /winnt/system32/drivers/etc/hosts

Display the
contents of the $INDEX_ROOT attribute of the root directory
(inode 5).

ntfscat
/dev/hda1 -a INDEX_ROOT -i 5 | hexdump -C
