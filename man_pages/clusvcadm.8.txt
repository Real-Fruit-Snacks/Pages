DESCRIPTION

The
clusvcadm command allows an administrator to enable,
disable, relocate, and restart user services in a cluster.
In order to perform cluster service operations, the cluster
daemons must be running (and have quorum) on the member
system on which the command is invoked.

OPTIONS

&minus;d

Stops and disables the user
service named service

&minus;e 

Enables and starts the user
service named service

&minus;l

Lock services in preparation for cluster shutdown. This
should only be used if the administrator intends to perform
a global, cluster wide shutdown. This prevents services from
starting (but not stopping, like -Z does). Once the
cluster quorum is dissolved, this state is reset. If a new
instance of rgmanager boots while others are locked, the
behavior is undefined.

&minus;u

Unlock resource group managers. This allows services to
start again.

&minus;S

Display whether the resource group managers are locked
or not. This can be used to verify the correct operation of
the -l and -u options, but is only useful for
debugging. 

&minus;m 

When used in conjunction with
either the &minus;e or &minus;r options, this
specifies the preferred target member on which to
start the service.

&minus;r 

Relocates the user service
named service to another cluster member.

&minus;R 

Restarts the user service named
service on the cluster member on which it is
currently running.

&minus;M 

Use a special
"migration" operation to move the user service
named service to another cluster member. Currently,
this is only useful for virtual machines. Use of migration
usually requires special configuration of the local virtual
machine manager in order to work correctly.

&minus;Z 

Freezes the service named
service on the cluster member on which it is
currently running. This will prevent status checks of the
service as well as failover in the event the node fails or
rgmanager is stopped.

&minus;U 

Unfreezes the user service
named service on the cluster member on which it is
currently running. This will re-enable status checks.

&minus;s 

Stops the service named
service until a member transition or until it is
enabled again.

&minus;v

Display version information and exit.

NOTES

Executing
-U (unfreeze) on a service which was frozen in the
started state while the service owner is offline
results in an undefined (and possibly dangerous) condition.
Manually ensure all resources are clear before doing
this.
