NAME

sq autocrypt -
Communicate certificates using Autocrypt

SYNOPSIS

sq autocrypt
import [OPTIONS] FILE 
sq autocrypt decode [OPTIONS] FILE 
sq autocrypt encode-sender [OPTIONS]
FILE

DESCRIPTION

Communicate
certificates using Autocrypt.

Autocrypt is a
standard for mail user agents to provide convenient
end-to-end encryption of emails. This subcommand provides a
limited way to produce and consume headers that are used by
Autocrypt to communicate certificates between clients.

See
https://autocrypt.org/>.

SUBCOMMANDS

sq autocrypt
import 
Import Autocrypt-encoded certificates.

Given a mail
containing autocrypt headers (or an key-gossip headers),
this command extracts and imports the certificates encoded
within it.

sq autocrypt
decode 
Read Autocrypt-encoded certificates.

Given an
autocrypt header (or an key-gossip header), this command
extracts the certificate encoded within it.

The converse
operation is ’sq autocrypt encode-sender’.

sq autocrypt
encode-sender 
Encode a certificate into an Autocrypt header.

A certificate
can be encoded and included in a header of an email message.
This command encodes the certificate, adds the senders email
address (which must match the one used in the
’From’ header), and the senders
’prefer-encrypt’ state (see the Autocrypt spec
for more information).

The converse
operation is ’sq autocrypt decode’.

EXAMPLES

sq autocrypt
import 
Imports all certificates from a mail

sq autocrypt
import autocrypt.eml

sq autocrypt
decode 
Extract all certificates from a mail

sq autocrypt
decode autocrypt.eml

sq autocrypt
encode-sender 
Encodes a certificate

sq autocrypt
encode-sender juliet.pgp

Encodes a
certificate with an explicit sender address

sq autocrypt
encode-sender --email juliet [AT] example.org juliet.pgp

Encodes a
certificate while indicating the willingness to encrypt

sq autocrypt
encode-sender --prefer-encrypt mutual juliet.pgp
