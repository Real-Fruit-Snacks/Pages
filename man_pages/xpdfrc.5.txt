NAME

xpdfrc -
configuration file for xpdf (xpopple)

DESCRIPTION

The xpdf
program reads a single configuration file. If you have a
.xpdfrc file in your home directory, it will be read.
Otherwise, a system-wide configuration file will be read
from /etc/xpdf/xpdfrc, if it exists. (This is its
default location; depending on build options, it may be
placed elsewhere.)

The xpdfrc file
consists of a series of configuration options, one per line.
Blank lines and lines starting with a '#’ (comments)
are ignored.

Arguments may
be quoted, using "double-quote" characters, e.g.,
for file names that contain spaces.

The following
sections list all of the configuration options, sorted into
functional groups. There is an examples section at the
end.

Note that all
settings are case-sensitive; in particular, boolean options
are "yes" and "no" (rather than
"Yes" or "No").

INCLUDE FILES

include
config-file

Includes the specified config
file. The effect of this is equivalent to inserting the
contents of config-file directly into the parent
config file in place of the include command. Config
files can be nested arbitrarily deeply.

GENERAL FONT CONFIGURATION

fontFile
PDF-font-name font-file

Maps a PDF font,
PDF-font-name, to a font for display or PostScript
output. The font file, font-file, can be any type
allowed in a PDF file. This command can be used for 8-bit or
16-bit (CID) fonts.

POSTSCRIPT CONTROL

psPaperSize
width(pts) height(pts)

Sets the paper size for
PostScript output. The width and height
parameters give the paper size in PostScript points (1 point
= 1/72 inch).

psPaperSize letter |
legal | A4 | A3 | match

Sets the paper size for
PostScript output to a standard size. The default paper size
is set when xpdf and pdftops are built, typically to
"letter" or "A4". This can also be set
to "match", which will set the paper size to match
the size specified in the PDF file.

psImageableArea llx lly
urx ury

Sets the imageable area for
PostScript output. The four integers are the coordinates of
the lower-left and upper-right corners of the imageable
region, specified in points (with the origin being the
lower-left corner of the paper). This defaults to the full
paper size; the psPaperSize option will reset the imageable
area coordinates.

psCrop yes | no

If set to "yes",
PostScript output is cropped to the CropBox specified in the
PDF file; otherwise no cropping is done. This defaults to
"yes".

psExpandSmaller yes |
no

If set to "yes", PDF
pages smaller than the PostScript imageable area are
expanded to fill the imageable area. Otherwise, no scalling
is done on smaller pages. This defaults to
"no".

psShrinkLarger yes |
no

If set to yes, PDF pages larger
than the PostScript imageable area are shrunk to fit the
imageable area. Otherwise, no scaling is done on larger
pages. This defaults to "yes".

psDuplex yes | no

If set to "yes", the
generated PostScript will set the "Duplex"
pagedevice entry. This tells duplex-capable printers to
enable duplexing. This defaults to "no".

psLevel level1 |
level1sep | level2 | level2sep | level3 | level3Sep

Sets the PostScript level to
generate. This defaults to "level2".

psFile
file-or-command

Sets the default PostScript
file or print command for xpdf. Commands start with a
'|’ character; anything else is a file. If the file
name or command contains spaces it must be quoted. This
defaults to unset, which tells xpdf to generate a name of
the form .ps for a PDF file
.pdf.

TEXT CONTROL

textEncoding
encoding-name

Sets the encoding to use for
text output. (This can be overridden with the
"-enc" switch on the command line.) The
encoding-name must be defined with the unicodeMap
command (see above). This defaults to
"Latin1".

MISCELLANEOUS SETTINGS

initialZoom
percentage | page | width | height

Sets the initial zoom factor. A
number specifies a zoom percentage, where 100 means 72 dpi.
You may also specify 'page’, to fit the page to the
window size, 'width’, to fit the page width to the
window width, or 'height’, to fit the page height to
the window height.

continuousView yes |
no

If set to "yes", xpdf
will start in continuous view mode, i.e., with one vertical
screoll bar for the whole document. This defaults to
"no".

overprintPreview yes
| no

If set to "yes",
generate overprint preview output, honoring the OP/op/OPM
settings in the PDF file. Ignored for non-CMYK output. The
default value is "no".

launchCommand
command

Sets the command executed when
you click on a "launch"-type link. The intent is
for the command to be a program/script which determines the
file type and runs the appropriate viewer. The command line
will consist of the file to be launched, followed by any
parameters specified with the link. Do not use
"%s" in "command". By default, this is
unset, and Xpdf will simply try to execute the file (after
prompting the user).

urlCommand
command

Sets the command executed when
you click on a URL link. The string "%s" will be
replaced with the URL. (See the example below.) This has no
default value.

movieCommand
command

Sets the command executed when
you click on a movie annotation. The string "%s"
will be replaced with the movie file name. This has no
default value.

bind modifiers-key
context command ...

Add a key or mouse button
binding. Modifiers can be zero or more of:

shift- 
ctrl- 
alt-

Key can
be a regular ASCII character, or any one of:

space 
tab 
return 
enter 
backspace 
insert 
delete 
home 
end 
pgup 
pgdn 
left / right / up / down (arrow keys) 
f1 .. f35 (function keys) 
mousePress1 .. mousePress7 (mouse buttons) 
mouseRelease1 .. mouseRelease7 (mouse buttons)

Context
is either "any" or a comma-separated combination
of:

fullScreen /
window (full screen mode on/off) 
continuous / singlePage (continuous mode on/off) 
overLink / offLink (mouse over link or not) 
scrLockOn / scrLockOff (scroll lock on/off)

The context
string can include only one of each pair in the above
list.

Command
is an Xpdf command (see the COMMANDS section of the
xpdf(1) man page for details). Multiple commands are
separated by whitespace.

The bind
command replaces any existing binding, but only if it was
defined for the exact same modifiers, key, and context. All
tokens (modifiers, key, context, commands) are
case-sensitive.

Example key
bindings:

# bind ctrl-a
in any context to the nextPage 
# command 
bind ctrl-a any nextPage

# bind
uppercase B, when in continuous mode 
# with scroll lock on, to the reload command 
# followed by the prevPage command 
bind B continuous,scrLockOn reload prevPage

See the
xpdf(1) man page for more examples.

unbind modifiers-key
context

Removes a key binding
established with the bind command. This is most useful to
remove default key bindings before establishing new ones
(e.g., if the default key binding is given for
"any" context, and you want to create new key
bindings for multiple contexts).

printCommands yes |
no

If set to "yes",
drawing commands are printed as they’re executed
(useful for debugging). This defaults to "no".

errQuiet yes |
no

If set to "yes", this
suppresses all error and warning messages from all of the
Xpdf tools. This defaults to "no".

This is the default location
for the system-wide configuration file. Depending on build
options, it may be placed elsewhere.

$HOME/.xpdfrc

This is the user’s
