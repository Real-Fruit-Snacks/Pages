IWI(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual IWI(4)

NAME

iwi — Intel
PRO/Wireless 2200BG/2225BG/2915ABG IEEE 802.11 driver

SYNOPSIS

To compile this driver into the
kernel, include the following lines in your kernel
configuration file:

device iwi

device iwifw 
device pci 
device wlan 
device firmware

Alternatively,
to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following line in loader.conf(5):

if_iwi_load="YES"

In both cases,
place the following line in loader.conf(5) to acknowledge
the firmware license (see below):

legal.intel_iwi.license_ack=1

DESCRIPTION

The iwi driver provides
support for Intel PRO/Wireless 2200BG/2915ABG MiniPCI and
2225BG PCI network adapters. iwi supports
station, adhoc, and monitor mode
operation. Only one virtual interface may be configured at
any time. For more information on configuring this device,
see ifconfig(8).

This driver
requires the firmware built with the iwifw module to
work. For the loaded firmware to be enabled for use the
license at /usr/share/doc/legal/intel_iwi.LICENSE
must be agreed by adding the following line to
loader.conf(5):

legal.intel_iwi.license_ack=1

EXAMPLES

Join an existing BSS network
(i.e., connect to an access point):

ifconfig wlan
create wlandev iwi0 inet 192.168.0.20 \ 
netmask 0xffffff00

Join a specific
BSS network with network name
’’my_net’’:

ifconfig wlan
create wlandev iwi0 ssid my_net up

Join a specific
BSS network with 64-bit WEP encryption:

ifconfig wlan
create wlandev iwi0 ssid my_net \

wepmode on wepkey 0x1234567890 weptxkey 1 up

Join a specific
BSS network with 128-bit WEP encryption:

ifconfig wlan
create wlandev iwi0 wlanmode adhoc ssid my_net \ 
wepmode on wepkey 0x01020304050607080910111213 weptxkey
1

DIAGNOSTICS

iwi%d: device
timeout  The driver will reset the hardware. This
should not happen.

iwi%d:
firmware error  The onboard microcontroller crashed
for some reason. The driver will reset the hardware. This
should not happen.

iwi%d:
timeout waiting for firmware initialization to
complete  The onboard microcontroller failed to
initialize in time. This should not happen.

iwi%d: could
not load firmware image ’%s’  The
driver failed to load the firmware image using the
firmware(9) subsystem. Verify the iwifw(4) firmware module
is installed and the license agreement loader(8) tunable has
been set.

iwi%d: could
not load boot firmware  An attempt to upload the
boot firmware image to the onboard microcontroller failed.
This should not happen.

iwi%d: could
not load microcode  An attempt to upload the
microcode image to the onboard microcontroller failed. This
should not happen.

iwi%d: could
not load main firmware  An attempt to upload the
main firmware image to the onboard microcontroller failed.
This should not happen.
