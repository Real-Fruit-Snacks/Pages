NAME

display-trueemu
: Emulate truecolor modes

SYNOPSIS

display-trueemu
: [-parent=] [-dither=] 
[-model=] 

DESCRIPTION

Emulates
truecolor modes (GT_TRUECOLOR) on another target
which can only do palette modes or truecolor modes of
different sizes/depths. Uses dithering and special palettes
to get the highest possible quality.

OPTIONS

-parent=

Force the parent target to use
a specific mode, specified as a standard LibGGI mode
string (see libggi(7)).

-dither=

Specifies the amount of
dithering. Legal values are 0, 2 and 4, defaulting to 4.
When the target is running, Ctrl-Alt-d changes the
dithering level.

-model=

Color model to use (only when
the parent is palettized). Legal values are rgb, cube and
pastel. Default depends on the parent mode. When the target
is running, Ctrl-Alt-p changes the current color
model.

target-spec

Specifies the target which to
draw on (the parent target). This defaults to
automatic selection (just like using ggiOpen(NULL)
when GGI_DISPLAY is not set).
