PTHREAD_GETCPUCLOCKID(3POSIPOSIX Programmer's ManPTHREAD_GETCPUCLOCKID(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       pthread_getcpuclockid — access a thread CPU-time clock (ADVANCED  REAL‐
       TIME THREADS)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pthread.h>
       #include <time.h>

       int pthread_getcpuclockid(pthread_t thread_id, clockid_t *clock_id);

DESCRIPTION
       The pthread_getcpuclockid() function shall return in clock_id the clock
       ID of the CPU-time clock of the thread specified by thread_id,  if  the
       thread specified by thread_id exists.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon  successful completion, pthread_getcpuclockid() shall return zero;
       otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       No errors are defined.

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       The pthread_getcpuclockid() function is part  of  the  Thread  CPU-Time
       Clocks option and need not be provided on all implementations.

RATIONALE
       If  an  implementation  detects use of a thread ID after the end of its
       lifetime, it is recommended that the function should fail and report an
       [ESRCH] error.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
