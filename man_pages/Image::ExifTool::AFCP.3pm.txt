NAME
       Image::ExifTool::AFCP - Read/write AFCP trailer

SYNOPSIS
       This module is used by Image::ExifTool

DESCRIPTION
       This module contains definitions required by Image::ExifTool to extract
       information from the AFCP trailer.  Although the AFCP specification is
       compatible with various file formats, ExifTool currently only processes
       AFCP in JPEG images.

NOTES
       AFCP is a specification which allows meta information (including IPTC)
       to be appended to the end of a file.

       It is a poorly designed protocol because (like TIFF) it uses absolute
       offsets to specify data locations.  This is a huge blunder because it
       makes the AFCP information dependent on the file length, so it is
       easily invalidated by image editing software which doesn't recognize
       the AFCP trailer to fix up these offsets when the file length changes.
       ExifTool will attempt to fix these invalid offsets if possible.

       Scanning for AFCP information may be time consuming, especially when
       reading from a sequential device, since the information is at the end
       of the file.  In these instances, the ExifTool FastScan option may be
       used to disable scanning for AFCP information.
