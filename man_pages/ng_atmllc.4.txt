NG_ATMLLC(4)

NAME

ng_atmllc â€” ATM LLC
netgraph node type

SYNOPSIS

#include

DESCRIPTION

The atmllc node type
translates frames in to and out of ATM LLC encapsulation, as
specified by RFC 1483. In LLC encapsulation the protocol of
a given protocol data unit (PDU) is specified by an IEEE
802.2 LLC header, possibly followed by an IEEE 802.1a
SubNetwork Attachment Point (SNAP) header. This node
currently handles the Ethernet and FDDI protocols.

The node
transmits and receives ATM PDUs on the atm hook.
Received PDUs are decoded and forwarded to the ether
or fddi hooks as appropriate. Data received on the
ether or fddi hooks are assumed to be full
Ethernet or FDDI packets as appropriate and are encapsulated
into a PDU and transmitted via the atm hook.

HOOKS

This node type supports the
following hooks:

atm

ATM connection.
Typically, this hook would be connected to a ng_atm(4) node,
which handles transmission of ATM PDUs over an ATM
device.

ether

Ethernet
connection. This hook sends and receives Ethernet frames.
This would normally be connected to an ng_eiface(4) node if
in use.

fddi

FDDI
connection. This hook sends and receives FDDI frames.

CONTROL MESSAGES

This node type supports the
generic control messages.

SHUTDOWN

This node shuts down upon
receipt of a NGM_SHUTDOWN control message, or when all hooks
have been disconnected.
