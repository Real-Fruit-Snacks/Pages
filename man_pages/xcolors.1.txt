NAME

xcolors -
display all X11 color names and colors

SYNOPSIS

xcolors
[ -start color ] [ -near color ]
[ -distance howfar ]

DESCRIPTION

xcolors
reads the rgb.txt file that defines the color names
the X server knows and displays the colors found.

At the top of
the window is a sample region containing text. By clicking
on the color names, the color of the sample text can be
changed. Mouse button 1 changes the foreground; button 2
changes the background. The text can also be edited.

Typing
&rsquo;&rsquo;q&rsquo;&rsquo; exits the program.

OPTIONS

In addition the
the usual X Toolkit options, xcolors understands
these command line options: 
-start name

specify a color name to start
with; colors before this one in the rgb.txt file are
skipped. This option is useful if there are more colors than
will fit on your screen or in your colormap.

-rgbfile
filename

specify an alternate color
database file to read.

-near
nearcolor

only show colors near this one
in the RGB space. All colors within a sphere in the
RGB-space centered on nearcolor are displayed.

-distance
howfar

defines how close colors have
to be to nearcolor to be displayed. This option sets
the radius of the sphere used by the -near option.
The scale is such that the RGB cube is 256 units on a side.
The default is 64.

ACTIONS

set-foreground([color])

Set the foreground color of the
sample region. If no color is provided, the color is
taken from the border color of the widget where the action
occurred.

set-background([color])

Same as set-foreground()
but sets the background color.

quit()

Exit xcolors.

BUGS

Assumes that
all names for the same color are consecutive in the
rgb.txt file.

Because
xcolors cannot read the server&rsquo;s color name
database, the color names it uses may not match those in the
server. This is most likely to happen if xcolors is
run from a remote host.

The program
would be faster if it used gadgets instead of widgets for
the color spots.
