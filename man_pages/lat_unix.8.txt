NAME

lat_unix -
measure interprocess communication latency via UNIX
sockets

SYNOPSIS

lat_unix
[ -m  ] [ -P
 ] [ -W  ] [
-N  ]

DESCRIPTION

lat_unix
is a client/server program that measures interprocess
communication latencies. The benchmark passes a message back
and forth between the two processes (this sort of benchmark
is frequently referred to as a &rsquo;&rsquo;hot
potato&rsquo;&rsquo; benchmark). No other work is done in
the processes.

OUTPUT

The reported
time is in microseconds per round trip and includes the
total time, i.e., the context switching overhead is
includeded. Output format is like so

AF_UNIX sock
stream latency: 700 microseconds

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

Funding for the
development of this tool was provided by Sun Microsystems
Computer Corporation.
