SYNOPSIS

kcon

[&minus;m map] [&minus;o]
[&minus;p] [&minus;R]
[&minus;r rate] [&minus;s]
[&minus;t+/-] [&minus;x]

DESCRIPTION

The kcon utility is used
for controlling all aspects of keyboard configuration for
the &rsquo;pcvt&rsquo; video driver.

The available
options are:

&minus;d delay

Specifies the delay after which
the last key entered will be repeated by the Keyboard. Valid
values are 0..3 corresponding to delays of 250, 500, 750 and
1000 milliseconds.

&minus;l

Displays the
current keyboard map in use by the driver.

&minus;m map

Specifies the map entry to be
searched in the keyboard capabilities database
keycap. The database is searched for the entry and if
found, the mapping is loaded and is used in the driver from
then on.

&minus;o

Switches
display of control codes to octal in the listing of the
current map. To be used in conjunction with the
&minus;l option.

&minus;p

Uses
&rsquo;pure&rsquo; output when listing - the Escape
character is displayed in either octal or hexadecimal and
not as &rsquo;ESC&rsquo;. To be used in conjunction with the
&minus;l option.

&minus;r rate

Specifies the character
repetition rate. Valid argument values are 0...31
corresponding to rates of 30 characters/second ... 2
characters/second.

&minus;R

Reset the
Keyboard.

&minus;s

Displays the
current settings of the rate and delay values.

&minus;t +/-

Specify this option to enable
(+) or disable (-) the repetition of keys.

&minus;x

Switches
display of control codes to hexadecimal in the listing of
the current map. To be used in conjunction with the
&minus;l option. This is the default behaviour.

FILES 
/usr/share/misc/keycap.pcvt

Keyboard
capabilities data base file if nothing else was chosen
during installation.

/dev/console

Keyboard raw
device.

BUGS

The kcon utility detects
several inconsistencies in the keycap database. In case of
errors kcon exits with an error message. If this
happens, the keyboard may remain in an undefined state. To
recover from such situation, execute &rsquo;&rsquo;kcon -m
default&rsquo;&rsquo;.

EXAMPLES

The command &rsquo;&rsquo;kcon
-m gb&rsquo;&rsquo; loads the entry &rsquo;gb&rsquo; from
the keycap file into the keyboard to switch to a british
keyboard behaviour.

The command
&rsquo;&rsquo;kcon -r 0 -d 0&rsquo;&rsquo; switches the
keyboard to emit characters at a rate of 30 characters per
second after a key has been held down for 250
milliseconds.
