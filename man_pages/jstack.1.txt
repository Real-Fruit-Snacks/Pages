JSTACK(1)                        JDK Commands                        JSTACK(1)

NAME
       jstack  -  print Java stack traces of Java threads for a specified Java
       process

SYNOPSIS
       Note: This command is experimental and unsupported.

       jstack [options] pid

       options
              This represents the jstack command-line  options.   See  Options
              for the jstack Command.

       pid    The  process  ID  for  which  the  stack  trace is printed.  The
              process must be a Java process.  To get a list of Java processes
              running  on  a machine, use either the ps command or, if the JVM
              processes are not running in a separate docker instance, the jps
              command.

DESCRIPTION
       The jstack command prints Java stack traces of Java threads for a spec‐
       ified Java process.  For each Java frame, the full class  name,  method
       name,  byte  code  index  (BCI),  and  line number, when available, are
       printed.  C++ mangled names aren't demangled.  To demangle  C++  names,
       the output of this command can be piped to c++filt.  When the specified
       process is running on a 64-bit JVM,  you  might  need  to  specify  the
       -J-d64 option, for example: jstack -J-d64 pid.

       Note:

       This  command  is  unsupported and might not be available in future re‐
       leases of the JDK.  In Windows Systems where the dbgeng.dll file  isn't
       present,  the  Debugging  Tools  for  Windows must be installed so that
       these tools work.  The PATH environment variable needs to  contain  the
       location  of the jvm.dll that is used by the target process, or the lo‐
       cation from which the core dump file was produced.

OPTIONS FOR THE JSTACK COMMAND
       -l     The long listing  option  prints  additional  information  about
              locks.

       -h or -help
              Prints a help message.
