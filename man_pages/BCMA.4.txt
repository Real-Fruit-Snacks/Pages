BCMA(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual BCMA(4)

NAME

bcma &mdash; Broadcom
AMBA Backplane driver

SYNOPSIS

To compile this driver into the
kernel, add the following lines to the kernel configuration
file:

device bhnd

device bcma

To load the
driver as a module at boot, add this line to
loader.conf(5):

bcma_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION

The bcma driver provides
bhnd(4) support for devices using the ARM AMBA-based
backplane architecture found in later Broadcom Home
Networking Division&rsquo;s network chipsets and embedded
systems.

A common
interconnect connects all of the backplane&rsquo;s
functional blocks. These functional blocks, known as cores,
use the ARM AMBA AXI or APB interface to communicate with
devices attached to the interconnect.

The IP cores
used in siba(4) devices were adapted by Broadcom for
compatibility with the new interconnect.
