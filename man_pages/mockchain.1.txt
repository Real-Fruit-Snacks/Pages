NAME

mockchain -
chain package builder.

SYNOPSIS

mockchain
−r chroot_config [options] [package...]

DESCRIPTION

mockchain
builds a series of srpms in mock one at a time. After each
successful build of a package it adds the resulting packages
to a local repo which are available to the next package to
satisfy buildreqs.

USAGE NOTES

This does not
try to sort the packages by build order because that is too
much effort and not obviously doable with the buildreq
information we have.

The build
process when you use −l is idempotent so a package
which has already been successfully built will not be built
again.

If you want to
force the rebuild of a package which has been built
successfully simply remove the ’success’ file
from the directory for the package in the localrepo
path.

OPTIONS

−a
REPOS, −−addrepo=REPOS

add this repo baseurl to the
yumconfig for the chroot. This can be specified multiple
times. Lets you point to multiple paths beyond the default
to pull build deps from.

−c,
−−continue

if a package fails to build,
continue to the next one, default is to stop.

−l LOCALREPO,
−−localrepo=PATH

set the path to put the
results/repo in. This path needs to be somewhere accessible
to users other than you for reading as the mock process
doesn’t run as you. Will make a tempdir if not
set.

−−log=LOGFILE

log to the file named by this
option, defaults to not logging.

−m OPTION,
−−mock-option=OPTION

pass the OPTION to mock. Can be
used several times. For example:

−m
−−define="packager Monkey"

−r CONFIG,
−−root=CONFIG

chroot config name to use in
the mock build.

−−recurse

build all packages, record the
failures and try to rebuild them again and again until
everything gets built (or until the set of packages failing
to build are the same over) sets −−continue
