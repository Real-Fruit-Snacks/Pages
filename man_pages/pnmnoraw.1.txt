NAME
       pnmnoraw - replaced by pnmtoplainpnm and pnmtopnm

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       pnmnoraw  was  replaced in Netpbm 8.2 (March 2000) by pnmtoplainpnm(1),
       which was obsoleted by pnmtopnm in Netpbm 10.23 (July 2004).

       pnmtoplainpnm was actually the same program; it  was  just  renamed  to
       make it clear that is just a format converter.

       pnmtopnm  is more general, in that it can go both directions.  pnmtopnm
       -plain is the same as pnmnoraw.
