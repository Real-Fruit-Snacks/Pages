NAME
       samba-log-parser - Samba (winbind) trace parser.

       options:
         -h, --help     show this help message and exit
         --traceid ID   specify the traceid of the trace records
         --pid PID      specify the pid of winbind client
         --breakdown    breakdown the traces into per traceid files
         --merge-by-timestamp   merge logs by timestamp
         --flow         show the request/sub-request flow traces
         --flow-compact show the request/sub-request flow traces without
       dcerpc details

SYNOPSIS
       samba-log-parser {path} [--pid=PID] [--traceid=ID] [--breakdown]
        [--merge-by-timestamp] [--flow] [--flow-compact] [-h|--help]

DESCRIPTION
       This tool is part of the samba(7) suite.

       The samba-log-parser program parses samba winbind logs.

OPTIONS
       The following options are available to the samba-log-parser program.

       --pid=PID
           Display traces for winbind client with the matching PID.

       --traceid=ID
           Display traces with matching traceid debug header field.

       --breakdown
           Break down all traces to separate files in the current working
           directory. For each traceid, three files are created: traceid.full
           traceid.flow traceid.flowcompact

       --merge-by-timestamp
           Sort the trace lines according to the timestamp. Works with log
           files without traceid header field as well.

       --flow
           Display the request/sub-request flow.

       --flow-compact
           Display the request/sub-request flow without dcerpc call details.

EXAMPLES
       Show the flow traces for trace id 1234 from log file log.winbind:

                # samba-log-parser --traceid 1234 --flow /var/log/samba/log.winbind

       Show the full traces for winbind client with PID 999999 sorted using
       the timestamp for log files found in the samba log directory:

                # samba-log-parser --pid 999999 --merge-by-timestamp /var/log/samba

       Break down the traces into separate files according to traceid sorted
       using the timestamp for log files found in the samba log directory:

                # samba-log-parser --breakdown --merge-by-timestamp /var/log/samba

       Sort traces using the timestamp for log files found in the samba log
       directory. Traces do not need to contain the traceid header field.

                # samba-log-parser --merge-by-timestamp /var/log/samba
