DESCRIPTION

pr−edit
can be used to edit an existing PR by either
replacing or appending to particular fields within the
PR, or providing a new PR to replace the
existing one. pr−edit can also be used to
create new PRs from scratch, or delete existing
ones.

pr−edit
also provides miscellaneous services for locking and
unlocking PRs, locking or unlocking an entire
database, or verifying that proposed PR contents are
valid and correct.

OPTIONS

−−lockdb, −L

Locks the specified database.
No PRs may be edited, created or deleted while the database
is locked.

This option is
generally used when editing the index file.

−−unlockdb, −U

Unlocks the database. No check
is made that the invoking user actually had locked the
database in the first place; hence, it is possible for
anyone to steal a database lock.

−−check, −c

−−check−initial, −C

The −−check
options are used to verify that a proposed PR’s
field contents are valid. The PR is read in (either
from stdin or a file specified with
−−filename), and its fields are compared
against the rules specified by the database configuration of
the selected database. Warnings are given for enumerated
fields whose contents do not contain one of the required
values or fields that do not match required regexps.

−−check−initial
is used to verify initial PRs, rather than proposed
edits of existing PRs.

−−submit, −s

Used to submit a new PR
to the database. The PR is read in and verified for
content; if the PR is valid as an initial PR,
it is then added to the database.

A zero exit
code is returned if the submission was successful.
Otherwise, the reason(s) for the PR being rejected
are printed to stdout, and a non-zero exit code is
returned.

The following
options require a PR number to be given. 
−−delete−pr

Deletes the specified PR
from the database. The PR must be in a closed state,
and not locked.

Only the GNATS
user (by default gnats) is permitted to delete
PRs.

−−lock=username, −l username

Locks the PR.
username is associated with the lock, so the system
administrator can determine who actually placed the lock on
the PR. However, anyone is permitted to remove locks
on a PR.

If the optional
−−process−id option is also given,
that process−id is associated with the
lock.

−−unlock, −u

Unlocks the PR.

−−append=field, −a field

−−replace=field, −r field

−−append and
−−replace are used to append or replace
content of a specific field within a PR. The new
field content is read in from stdin (or from the file
specified with the −−filename option),
and either appended or replaced to the specified field. The
field contents are verified for correctness before the
PR is rewritten.

If the edit is
successful, a zero exit status is returned. If the edit
failed, a non-zero exit status is returned, and the reasons
for the failure are printed to stdout.

−−reason=reason, −R reason

Certain PR fields are
configured in the database configuration to require a short
text describing the reason for every change that is made to
them. If you edit a PR and change any such fields, you must
provide a short text, the reason for the change,
through this option. If the option is used and no
change-reason requiring field is actually changed, the
option has no effect.

[PR]

If only a PR number is specified with no other
options, a replacement PR is read in (either from
stdin or the file specified with
−−filename). If the PR contents
are valid and correct, the existing PR is replaced
with the new PR contents.

If the edit is
successful, a zero exit status is returned. If the edit
failed, a non-zero exit status is returned, and the reasons
for the failure are printed to stdout.

−−database=database, −d database

Specifies the database which is
to be manipulated. If no database is specified, the database
named default is assumed. This option overrides the
database specified in the GNATSDB environment
variable.

−−filename=filename, −f filename

For actions that require
reading in a PR or field content, this specifies the
name of a file to read. If −−filename is
not specified, the PR or field content is read in
from stdin.

−−version, −V

Displays the version number of
the program.

−−help, −h

Prints a brief usage
message.

−−host=host, −H host

Hostname of the GNATS
server.

−−port=port, −P port

The port that the GNATS server
runs on.

−−user=username, −v username

Username used when logging into
the GNATS server.

−−passwd=password, −w password

Password used when logging into
the GNATS server.

−−debug, −D

Used to debug network
connections.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

The
GNATSDB environment variable is used to determine
which database to use. For a local database, it contains the
name of the database to access.

For network
access via gnatsd, it contains a colon-separated list
of strings that describe the remote database, in the form

server:port:databasename:username:password

Any of the
fields may be omitted, but at least one colon must appear;
otherwise, the value is assumed to be the name of a local
database.

If
GNATSDB is not set and the --database option is not
supplied, it is assumed that the database is local and that
its name is default.
