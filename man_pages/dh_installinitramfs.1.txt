NAME

dh_installinitramfs
- install initramfs hooks and setup maintscripts

SYNOPSIS

dh_installinitramfs
[debhelper options] [-n]

DESCRIPTION

dh_installinitramfs
is a debhelper program that is responsible for installing
Debian package provided initramfs hooks.

If
dh_installinitramfs installs or detects one or more
initramfs hooks in the package, then it also automatically
generates the noawait trigger update-initframfs
command needed to interface with the Debian initramfs
system. This trigger is inserted into the packaging by
dh_installdeb(1).

FILES

debian/package.initramfs-hook

Assumed to be an initramfs hook
that will be installed into
usr/share/initramfs-tools/hooks/package in the
package build directory. See HOOK
SCRIPTS in initramfs-tools(8) for more
information about initramfs hooks.

OPTIONS

-n,
--no-scripts

Do not add the
update-initramfs trigger even if it seems like the
package might need it. The option is called
--no-scripts for historical reasons as
dh_installinitramfs would previously generate
maintainer scripts that called update-initramfs
-u.

Use this
option, if you need to interface with the
update-initramfs system that is not satisfied by the
noawait trigger (e.g. because you need the extra guarantees
and head-aches of a await trigger).

NOTES

Note that this
command is not idempotent. dh_prep(1) should be
called between invocations of this command. Otherwise, it
may cause multiple instances of the same text to be added to
triggers file.
