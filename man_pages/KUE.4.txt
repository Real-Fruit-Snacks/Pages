NAME

kue &mdash; Kawasaki LSI
KL5KUSB101B USB Ethernet driver

SYNOPSIS

To compile this driver into the
kernel, place the following lines in your kernel
configuration file:

device uhci

device ohci 
device usb 
device miibus 
device uether 
device kue

Alternatively,
to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following line in loader.conf(5):

if_kue_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION

The kue driver provides
support for USB Ethernet adapters based on the Kawasaki LSI
KL5KLUSB101B chipset.

The KL5KLUSB101B
supports a 128-entry multicast filter, single perfect filter
entry for the station address and promiscuous mode. Packets
are received and transmitted over separate USB bulk transfer
endpoints.

The Kawasaki
chipset supports only 10Mbps half-duplex mode, hence there
are no ifmedia(4) modes to select.

For more
information on configuring this device, see ifconfig(8).

BUGS

The kue driver does not
accumulate Ethernet collisions statistics because the
Kawasaki firmware does not appear to maintain any internal
statistics.
