sane-as6e(5)             SANE Scanner Access Now Easy             sane-as6e(5)

NAME
       sane-as6e  - SANE backend for using the Artec AS6E parallel port inter‐
       face scanner.

DESCRIPTION
       The sane-as6e library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) back‐
       end  that  provides  access to Artec AS6E flatbed scanner.  It requires
       the as6edriver program in order to operate. The as6edriver  program  is
       not   included   with   the   SANE   package.   It   can  be  found  at
       http://as6edriver.sourceforge.net.  See  the  as6edriver  documentation
       for technical information.

       The  as6edriver  program  must  be in the path for executables ($PATH).
       Especially if you run saned(8) (the SANE network scanning daemon), take
       care to setup the path for inetd(8) or xinetd(8) correctly or place the
       program in a directory that is in the path.

FILES
       as6edriver - driver program that controls the scanner.
