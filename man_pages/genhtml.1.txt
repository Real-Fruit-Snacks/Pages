DESCRIPTION

Create an HTML
view of coverage data found in tracefile. Note that
tracefile may also be a list of filenames.

HTML output
files are created in the current working directory unless
the --output-directory option is used. If tracefile
ends with ".gz", it is assumed to be
GZIP-compressed and the gunzip tool will be used to
decompress it transparently.

Note that all
source code files have to be present and readable at the
exact file system location they were compiled.

Use option
--css-file to modify layout and colors of the
generated HTML output. Files are marked in different colors
depending on the associated coverage rate. By default, the
coverage limits for low, medium and high coverage are set to
0-75%, 75-90% and 90-100% percent respectively. To change
these values, use configuration file options
genhtml_hi_limit and genhtml_med_limit.

Also note that
when displaying percentages, 0% and 100% are only printed
when the values are exactly 0% and 100% respectively. Other
values which would conventionally be rounded to 0% or 100%
are instead printed as nearest non-boundary value. This
behavior is in accordance with that of the gcov(1)
tool.

OPTIONS

-h 
--help

Print a short help text, then
exit.

-v 
--version

Print version number, then
exit.

-q 
--quiet

Do not print progress
messages.

Suppresses all
informational progress output. When this switch is enabled,
only error or warning messages are printed.

-f 
--frames

Use HTML frames for source code
view.

If enabled, a
frameset is created for each source code file, providing an
overview of the source code as a "clickable"
image. Note that this option will slow down output creation
noticeably because each source code character has to be
inspected once. Note also that the GD.pm Perl module has to
be installed for this option to work (it may be obtained
from http://www.cpan.org).

-s 
--show-details

Generate detailed directory
view.

When this
option is enabled, genhtml generates two versions of
each file view. One containing the standard information plus
a link to a "detailed" version. The latter
additionally contains information about which test case
covered how many lines of each source file.

-b
baseline-file 
--baseline-file baseline-file

Use data in
baseline-file as coverage baseline.

The tracefile
specified by baseline-file is read and all counts
found in the original tracefile are decremented by
the corresponding counts in baseline-file before
creating any output.

Note that when
a count for a particular line in baseline-file is
greater than the count in the tracefile, the result
is zero.

-o
output-directory 
--output-directory output-directory

Create files in
output-directory.

Use this option
to tell genhtml to write the resulting files to a
directory other than the current one. If
output-directory does not exist, it will be
created.

It is advisable
to use this option since depending on the project size, a
lot of files and subdirectories may be created.

-t
title 
--title title

Display title in header
of all pages.

title is
written to the header portion of each generated HTML page to
identify the context in which a particular output was
created. By default this is the name of the tracefile.

-d
description-file 
--description-file description-file

Read test case descriptions
from description-file.

All test case
descriptions found in description-file and referenced
in the input data file are read and written to an extra page
which is then incorporated into the HTML output.

The file format
of description-file is:

for each test
case:

TN: 
TD:

Valid test case
names can consist of letters, numbers and the underscore
character (&rsquo;_&rsquo;).

-k 
--keep-descriptions

Do not remove unused test
descriptions.

Keep
descriptions found in the description file even if the
coverage data indicates that the associated test case did
not cover any lines of code.

This option can
also be configured permanently using the configuration file
option genhtml_keep_descriptions.

-c
css-file 
--css-file css-file

Use external style sheet file
css-file.

Using this
option, an extra .css file may be specified which will
replace the default one. This may be helpful if the default
colors make your eyes want to jump out of their sockets
:)

This option can
also be configured permanently using the configuration file
option genhtml_css_file.

-p
prefix 
--prefix prefix

Remove prefix from all
directory names.

Because lists
containing long filenames are difficult to read, there is a
mechanism implemented that will automatically try to shorten
all directory names on the overview page beginning with a
common prefix. By default, this is done using an algorithm
that tries to find the prefix which, when applied, will
minimize the resulting sum of characters of all directory
names.

Use this option
to specify the prefix to be removed by yourself.

--no-prefix

Do not remove prefix from
directory names.

This switch
will completely disable the prefix mechanism described in
the previous section.

This option can
also be configured permanently using the configuration file
option genhtml_no_prefix.

--no-source

Do not create source code
view.

Use this switch
if you don&rsquo;t want to get a source code view for each
file.

This option can
also be configured permanently using the configuration file
option genhtml_no_source.

--num-spaces
spaces

Replace tabs in source view
with num spaces.

Default value
is 8.

This option can
also be configured permanently using the configuration file
option genhtml_num_spaces.

--highlight

Highlight lines with
converted-only coverage data.

Use this option
in conjunction with the --diff option of lcov to
highlight those lines which were only covered in data sets
which were converted from previous source code versions.

This option can
also be configured permanently using the configuration file
option genhtml_highlight.

--legend

Include color legend in HTML
output.

Use this option
to include a legend explaining the meaning of color coding
in the resulting HTML output.

This option can
also be configured permanently using the configuration file
option genhtml_legend.

--html-prolog
prolog-file

Read customized HTML prolog
from prolog-file.

Use this option
to replace the default HTML prolog (the initial part of the
HTML source code leading up to and including the
 tag) with the contents of prolog-file.
Within the prolog text, the following words will be replaced
when a page is generated:

@pagetitle@

The title of the page.

@basedir@

A relative path leading to the base directory (e.g. for
locating css-files).

This option can
also be configured permanently using the configuration file
option genhtml_html_prolog.

--html-epilog
epilog-file

Read customized HTML epilog
from epilog-file.

Use this option
to replace the default HTML epilog (the final part of the
HTML source including ) with the contents of
epilog-file.

Within the
epilog text, the following words will be replaced when a
page is generated:

@basedir@

A relative path leading to the base directory (e.g. for
locating css-files).

This option can
also be configured permanently using the configuration file
option genhtml_html_epilog.

--html-extension
extension

Use customized filename
extension for generated HTML pages.

This option is
useful in situations where different filename extensions are
required to render the resulting pages correctly (e.g. php).
Note that a &rsquo;.&rsquo; will be inserted between the
filename and the extension specified by this option.

This option can
also be configured permanently using the configuration file
option genhtml_html_extension.

--html-gzip

Compress all generated html
files with gzip and add a .htaccess file specifying
gzip-encoding in the root output directory.

Use this option
if you want to save space on your webserver. Requires a
webserver with .htaccess support and a browser with support
for gzip compressed html.

This option can
also be configured permanently using the configuration file
option genhtml_html_gzip.

--sort 
--no-sort

Specify whether to include
sorted views of file and directory overviews.

Use --sort to
include sorted views or --no-sort to not include them.
Sorted views are enabled by default.

When sorted
views are enabled, each overview page will contain links to
views of that page sorted by coverage rate.

This option can
also be configured permanently using the configuration file
option genhtml_sort.

--function-coverage

--no-function-coverage

Specify whether to display
function coverage summaries in HTML output.

Use
--function-coverage to enable function coverage summaries or
--no-function-coverage to disable it. Function coverage
summaries are enabled by default

When function
coverage summaries are enabled, each overview page will
contain the number of functions found and hit per file or
directory, together with the resulting coverage rate. In
addition, each source code view will contain a link to a
page which lists all functions found in that file plus the
respective call count for those functions.

This option can
also be configured permanently using the configuration file
option genhtml_function_coverage.

--branch-coverage

--no-branch-coverage

Specify whether to display
branch coverage data in HTML output.

Use
--branch-coverage to enable branch coverage display or
--no-branch-coverage to disable it. Branch coverage data
display is enabled by default

When branch
coverage display is enabled, each overview page will contain
the number of branches found and hit per file or directory,
together with the resulting coverage rate. In addition, each
source code view will contain an extra column which lists
all branches of a line with indications of whether the
branch was taken or not. Branches are shown in the following
format:

&rsquo; +
&rsquo;: Branch was taken at least once 
&rsquo; - &rsquo;: Branch was not taken 
&rsquo; # &rsquo;: The basic block containing the branch was
never executed

Note that it
might not always be possible to relate branches to the
corresponding source code statements: during compilation,
GCC might shuffle branches around or eliminate some of them
to generate better code.

This option can
also be configured permanently using the configuration file
option genhtml_branch_coverage.

--demangle-cpp

Specify whether to demangle C++
function names.

Use this option
if you want to convert C++ internal function names to human
readable format for display on the HTML function overview
page. This option requires that the c++filt tool is
installed (see c++filt(1)).

--ignore-errors
errors

Specify a list of errors after
which to continue processing.

Use this option
to specify a list of one or more classes of errors after
which geninfo should continue processing instead of
aborting.

errors
can be a comma-separated list of the following keywords:

source:
the source code file for a data set could not be found.

--config-file
config-file

Specify a configuration file to
use.

When this
option is specified, neither the system-wide configuration
file /etc/lcovrc, nor the per-user configuration file
~/.lcovrc is read.

This option may
be useful when there is a need to run several instances of
genhtml with different configuration file options in
parallel.

--rc
keyword=value

Override a configuration
directive.

Use this option
to specify a keyword=value statement which
overrides the corresponding configuration statement in the
lcovrc configuration file. You can specify this option more
than once to override multiple configuration statements. See
lcovrc(5) for a list of available keywords and their
meaning.

--precision
num

Show coverage rates with
num number of digits after the decimal-point.

Default value
is 1.

This option can
also be configured permanently using the configuration file
option genhtml_precision.

--missed

Show counts of missed lines,
functions, or branches

Use this option
to change overview pages to show the count of lines,
functions, or branches that were not hit. These counts are
represented by negative numbers.

When specified
together with --sort, file and directory views will be
sorted by missed counts.

This option can
also be configured permanently using the configuration file
option genhtml_missed.

FILES

/etc/lcovrc

The system-wide configuration
file.

~/.lcovrc

The per-user configuration
file.
