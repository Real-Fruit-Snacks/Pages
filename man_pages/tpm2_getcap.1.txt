NAME

tpm2_getcap(1)
- Display TPM capabilities in a human readable form.

SYNOPSIS

tpm2_getcap
[OPTIONS] [CAPABILITY]

DESCRIPTION

tpm2_getcap(1)
- Query the TPM for it&rsquo;s capabilities / properties and
print them to the console. It takes a string form of the
capability to query as an argument to the tool. Currently
supported capability groups are:

&bull;

algorithms: Display data about supported
algorithms. 

&bull;

commands: Display data about supported
commands. 

&bull;

pcrs: Display currently allocated PCRs.

&bull;

properties-fixed: Display fixed TPM
properties. 

&bull;

properties-variable: Display variable TPM
properties. 

&bull;

ecc-curves: Display data about elliptic
curves. 

&bull;

handles-transient: Display handles about
transient objects.

&bull;

handles-persistent: Display handles about
persistent objects.

&bull;

handles-permanent: Display handles about
permanent objects.

&bull;

handles-pcr: Display handles about PCRs.

&bull;

handles-nv-index: Display handles about NV
Indices. 

&bull;

handles-loaded-session: Display handles about
both loaded HMAC and policy sessions.

&bull;

handles-saved-session: Display handles about
saved sessions.

&bull;

vendor[:num]: Displays the vendor properties as a
hex buffer output. The string &ldquo;vendor&rdquo; can be
suffixed with a colon followed by a number as understood by
strtoul(3) with a 0 base. That value is used as the property
value within the

TPM2_GetCapability command, and
defaults to 1. An example to call it with a property value
of 2 is: tpm2_getcap vendor:2

NOTE: if vendor
requests hang, try the &ldquo;-i&rdquo; option to ignore the
moreData field and only read once.

OPTIONS

&bull;

-l, --list:

List known
supported capability names. These names can be supplied as
the argument to the -c option. Output is in a YAML
compliant list to stdout.

For
example:

  - algorithms
  - commands
  - properties-fixed
  ...

&bull;

--ignore-moredata

Ignores the
moreData field when dealing with buggy TPM responses.

COMMON OPTIONS

This collection
of options are common to many programs and provide
information that many users may expect.

&bull;

-h,
--help=[man|no-man]: Display the tools manpage. By
default, it attempts to invoke the manpager for the tool,
however, on failure will output a short tool summary. This
is the same behavior if the &ldquo;man&rdquo; option
argument is specified, however if explicit &ldquo;man&rdquo;
is requested, the tool will provide errors from man on
stderr. If the &ldquo;no-man&rdquo; option if specified, or
the manpager fails, the short options will be output to
stdout. 

To successfully
use the manpages feature requires the manpages to be
installed or on MANPATH, See man(1) for more
details.

&bull;

-v, --version:
Display version information for this tool, supported tctis
and exit.

&bull;

-V, --verbose: Increase the information
that the tool prints to the console during its execution.
When using this option the file and line number are
printed. 

&bull;

-Q, --quiet: Silence normal tool output to
stdout. 

&bull;

-Z, --enable-errata: Enable the
application of errata fixups. Useful if an errata fixup
needs to be applied to commands sent to the TPM. Defining
the environment TPM2TOOLS_ENABLE_ERRATA is equivalent.

&bull;

-R, --autoflush: Enable autoflush for
transient objects created by the command. If a parent object
is loaded from a context file also the transient parent
object will be flushed. Autoflush can also be activated if
the environment variable TPM2TOOLS_AUTOFLUSH is is set to
yes or true.

TCTI Configuration

The TCTI or
&ldquo;Transmission Interface&rdquo; is the communication
mechanism with the TPM. TCTIs can be changed for
communication with TPMs across different mediums.

To control the
TCTI, the tools respect:

1.

The command line option
-T or --tcti

2.

The environment variable: TPM2TOOLS_TCTI.

Note:
The command line option always overrides the environment
variable.

The current
known TCTIs are:

&bull;

tabrmd - The resource manager,
called tabrmd (https://github.com/tpm2-software/tpm2-abrmd).
Note that tabrmd and abrmd as a tcti name are
synonymous. 

&bull;

mssim - Typically used for communicating to the TPM
software simulator.

&bull;

device - Used when talking directly to a TPM device
file. 

&bull;

none - Do not initalize a connection with the TPM. Some
tools allow for off-tpm options and thus support not using a
TCTI. Tools that do not support it will error when attempted
to be used without a TCTI connection. Does not support
ANY options and MUST BE presented as the exact
text of &ldquo;none&rdquo;.

The arguments
to either the command line option or the environment
variable are in the form:

:

Specifying an
empty string for either the  or
 results in the default
being used for that portion respectively.

TCTI
Defaults 
When a TCTI is not specified, the default TCTI is searched
for using dlopen(3) semantics. The tools will search
for tabrmd, device and mssim TCTIs
IN THAT ORDER and USE THE FIRST ONE FOUND. You
can query what TCTI will be chosen as the default by using
the -v option to print the version information. The
&ldquo;default-tcti&rdquo; key-value pair will indicate
which of the aforementioned TCTIs is the default.

Custom
TCTIs 
Any TCTI that implements the dynamic TCTI interface can be
loaded. The tools internally use dlopen(3), and the
raw tcti-name value is used for the lookup. Thus,
this could be a path to the shared library, or a library
name as understood by dlopen(3) semantics.

TCTI OPTIONS

This collection
of options are used to configure the various known TCTI
modules available:

&bull;

device: For the device
TCTI, the TPM character device file for use by the device
TCTI can be specified. The default is /dev/tpm0.

Example: -T
device:/dev/tpm0 or export
TPM2TOOLS_TCTI=&ldquo;device:/dev/tpm0&rdquo;

&bull;

mssim: For the mssim
TCTI, the domain name or IP address and port number used by
the simulator can be specified. The default are 127.0.0.1
and 2321.

Example: -T
mssim:host=localhost,port=2321 or export
TPM2TOOLS_TCTI=&ldquo;mssim:host=localhost,port=2321&rdquo;

&bull;

abrmd: For the abrmd
TCTI, the configuration string format is a series of simple
key value pairs separated by a &rsquo;,&rsquo; character.
Each key and value string are separated by a &rsquo;=&rsquo;
character. 

&bull;

TCTI abrmd supports two
keys: 

1.

&rsquo;bus_name&rsquo; : The
name of the tabrmd service on the bus (a string).

2.

&rsquo;bus_type&rsquo; : The type of the dbus instance
(a string) limited to &rsquo;session&rsquo; and
&rsquo;system&rsquo;. 

Specify the
tabrmd tcti name and a config string of
bus_name=com.example.FooBar:

\--tcti=tabrmd:bus_name=com.example.FooBar

Specify the
default (abrmd) tcti and a config string of
bus_type=session:

\--tcti:bus_type=session

NOTE:
abrmd and tabrmd are synonymous.

EXAMPLES

To list the
fixed properties of the TPM

To list the
supported capability groups
tpm2_getcap -l
