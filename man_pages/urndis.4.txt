DESCRIPTION

The urndis driver
provides Ethernet access over Remote NDIS (RNDIS), allowing
mobile devices such as phones and tablets to provide network
access. It is often referred to as USB tethering, and in
most cases must be explicitly enabled on the device.

urndis
should work with any USB RNDIS devices, such as those
commonly found on Android devices. It does not support
different media types or options. For more information on
configuring this device, see ifconfig(8).

HARDWARE

The urndis driver
supports the "tethering" functionality of many
Android devices.
