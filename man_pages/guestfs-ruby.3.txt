guestfs-ruby -
How to use libguestfs from Ruby

SYNOPSIS

require
'guestfs' 
g = Guestfs::Guestfs.new() 
g.add_drive_opts("disk.img", 
:readonly => true, :format => "raw") 
g.launch()

DESCRIPTION

This manual
page documents how to call libguestfs from the Ruby
programming language. This page just documents the
differences from the C API and gives some examples. If you
are not familiar with using libguestfs, you also need to
read guestfs(3).

EXCEPTIONS

Errors from libguestfs functions are mapped into the
"Error" exception. This has a single parameter
which is the error message (a string).

EXAMPLE 1: CREATE A DISK IMAGE

# Example
showing how to create a disk image. 
require 'guestfs' 
output = "disk.img" 
g = Guestfs::Guestfs.new() 
# Create a raw-format sparse disk image, 512 MB in size.

g.disk_create (output, "raw", 512 * 1024 * 1024)

# Set the trace flag so that we can see each libguestfs
call. 
g.set_trace(1) 
# Attach the disk image to libguestfs. 
g.add_drive_opts(output, :format => "raw") 
# Run the libguestfs back-end. 
g.launch(); 
# Get the list of devices. Because we only added one drive

# above, we expect that this list should contain a single

# element. 
devices = g.list_devices() 
if devices.length != 1 then 
raise "error: expected a single device from
list-devices" 
end 
# Partition the disk as one single MBR partition. 
g.part_disk(devices[0], "mbr") 
# Get the list of partitions. We expect a single element,
which 
# is the partition we have just created. 
partitions = g.list_partitions() 
if partitions.length != 1 then 
raise "error: expected a single partition from
list-partitions" 
end 
# Create a filesystem on the partition. 
g.mkfs("ext4", partitions[0]) 
# Now mount the filesystem so that we can add files. 
g.mount(partitions[0], "/") 
# Create some files and directories. 
g.touch("/empty") 
message = "Hello, world\n" 
g.write("/hello", message) 
g.mkdir("/foo") 
# This one uploads the local file /etc/resolv.conf into 
# the disk image. 
g.upload("/etc/resolv.conf",
"/foo/resolv.conf") 
# Because we wrote to the disk and we want to detect write

# errors, call g.shutdown. You don't need to do this: 
# g.close will do it implicitly. 
g.shutdown() 
# Note also that handles are automatically closed if they
are 
# reaped by the garbage collector. You only need to call
close 
# if you want to close the handle right away. 
g.close()

EXAMPLE 2: INSPECT A VIRTUAL MACHINE DISK IMAGE

# Example
showing how to inspect a virtual machine disk. 
require 'guestfs' 
if ARGV.length == 0 
puts "usage: inspect_vm disk.img" 
exit 1 
end 
disk = ARGV[0] 
g = Guestfs::Guestfs.new() 
# Attach the disk image read-only to libguestfs. 
g.add_drive_opts(disk, :readonly => true) 
# Run the libguestfs back-end. 
g.launch() 
# Ask libguestfs to inspect for operating systems. 
roots = g.inspect_os() 
if roots.length == 0 
puts "inspect_vm: no operating systems found" 
exit 1 
end 
for root in roots do 
printf("Root device: %s\n", root) 
# Print basic information about the operating system. 
printf(" Product name: %s\n",
g.inspect_get_product_name(root)) 
printf(" Version: %d.%d\n", 
g.inspect_get_major_version(root), 
g.inspect_get_minor_version(root)) 
printf(" Type: %s\n", g.inspect_get_type(root))

printf(" Distro: %s\n",
g.inspect_get_distro(root)) 
# Mount up the disks, like guestfish -i. 
# 
# Sort keys by length, shortest first, so that we end up

# mounting the filesystems in the correct order. 
mps = g.inspect_get_mountpoints(root) 
mps = mps.sort {|a,b| a[0].length  b[0].length}

for mp in mps do 
begin 
g.mount_ro(mp[1], mp[0]) 
rescue Guestfs::Error => msg 
printf("%s (ignored)\n", msg) 
end 
end 
# If /etc/issue.net file exists, print up to 3 lines. 
filename = "/etc/issue.net" 
if g.is_file filename then 
printf("--- %s ---\n", filename) 
lines = g.head_n(3, filename) 
for line in lines do 
puts line 
end 
end 
# Unmount everything. 
g.umount_all() 
end
