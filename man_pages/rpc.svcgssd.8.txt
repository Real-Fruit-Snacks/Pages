NAME

rpc.svcgssd -
server-side rpcsec_gss daemon

SYNOPSIS

rpc.svcgssd
[-n] [-v] [-r] [-i] [-f] [-p principal]

DESCRIPTION

The rpcsec_gss
protocol gives a means of using the gss-api generic security
api to provide security for protocols using rpc (in
particular, nfs). Before exchanging any rpc requests using
rpcsec_gss, the rpc client must first establish a security
context with the rpc server. The linux kernel&rsquo;s
implementation of rpcsec_gss depends on the userspace daemon
rpc.svcgssd to handle context establishment on the
rpc server. The daemon uses files in the proc filesystem to
communicate with the kernel.

OPTIONS

-f

Runs rpc.svcgssd in the
foreground and sends output to stderr (as opposed to
syslogd) 

-v

Increases the verbosity of the output (can be specified
multiple times).

-r

If the rpcsec_gss library supports setting debug level,
increases the verbosity of the output (can be specified
multiple times).

-i

If the nfsidmap library supports setting debug level,
increases the verbosity of the output (can be specified
multiple times).

-p

Use principal instead of the default
nfs/FQDN@REALM. 

-n

Use the system default credentials
(host/FQDN@REALM) rather than the default
nfs/FQDN@REALM. 

CONFIGURATION FILE

Some of the
options that can be set on the command line can also be
controlled through values set in the [svcgssd]
section of the /etc/nfs.conf configuration file.
Values recognized include: 
principal

If set to system this is
equivalent to the -n option. If set to any other
value, that is used like the -p option.

verbosity

Value which is equivalent to
the number of -v.

rpc-verbosity

Value which is equivalent to
the number of -r.

idmap-verbosity

Value which is equivalent to
the number of -i.
