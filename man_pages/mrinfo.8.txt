NAME

mrinfo &mdash; display
configuration info from a multicast router

SYNOPSIS

mrinfo
[&minus;d debug_level]
[&minus;r retry_count]
[&minus;t timeout_count]
multicast_router

DESCRIPTION

The mrinfo utility
attempts to display the configuration information from the
multicast router multicast_router.

The
mrinfo utility uses the ASK_NEIGHBORS IGMP message to
the specified multicast router. If this multicast router
responds, the version number and a list of their neighboring
multicast router addresses is part of that response. If the
responding router has a recent multicast version number,
then mrinfo requests additional information such as
metrics, thresholds, and flags from the multicast router.
Once the specified multicast router responds, the
configuration is displayed to the standard output.

The following
options are available:

&minus;d
debug_level

Set the debug level. When the
debug level is greater than the default value of 0, addition
debugging messages are printed. Regardless of the debug
level, an error condition, will always write an error
message and will cause mrinfo to terminate. Non-zero
debug levels have the following effects:

level 1

packet warnings are printed to
stderr.

level 2

all level 1 messages plus
notifications down networks are printed to stderr.

level 3

all level 2 messages plus
notifications of all packet timeouts are printed to
stderr.

&minus;r
retry_count

Set the neighbor query retry
limit. Default is 3 retries.

&minus;t
timeout_count

Set the number of seconds to
wait for a neighbor query reply. Default timeout is 4
seconds.

SAMPLE OUTPUT

mrinfo
mbone.phony.dom.net 
127.148.176.10 (mbone.phony.dom.net) [version 3.3]: 
127.148.176.10 -> 0.0.0.0 (?) [1/1/querier] 
127.148.176.10 -> 127.0.8.4 (mbone2.phony.dom.net)
[1/45/tunnel] 
127.148.176.10 -> 105.1.41.9 (momoney.com)
[1/32/tunnel/down] 
127.148.176.10 -> 143.192.152.119 (mbone.dipu.edu)
[1/32/tunnel]

For each
neighbor of the queried multicast router, the IP of the
queried router is displayed, followed by the IP and name of
the neighbor. In square brackets the metric (cost of
connection), the threshold (multicast ttl) is displayed. If
the queried multicast router has a newer version number, the
type (tunnel, srcrt) and status (disabled, down) of the
connection is displayed.

IMPORTANT NOTE

The mrinfo utility must
be run as root.
