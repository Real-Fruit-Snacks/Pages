NAME
       Font::TTF::Fpgm - Font program in a TrueType font. Called when a font
       is loaded

DESCRIPTION
       This is a minimal class adding nothing beyond a table, but is a
       repository for fpgm type information for those processes brave enough
       to address hinting.

   $t->read
       Reading this table is simply a process of reading all the data into the
       RAM copy. Nothing more is done with it.

   $t->out_xml($context, $depth)
       Outputs Fpgm program as XML

   $t->XML_end($context, $tag, %attrs)
       Parse all that hinting code

BUGS
       None known
