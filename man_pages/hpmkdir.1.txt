NAME

hpmkdir â€”
create a directory on an HFS+ volume

SYNOPSIS

hpmkdir
hfs-path

Description

hpmkdir
creates a new directory under the current working directory
on the previously mounted HFS+ volume. Since write access to
HFS+ volumes is still experimental, the program prints a
warning message and prompts the user before writing anything
to the file system.
