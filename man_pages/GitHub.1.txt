NAME

elvi &minus;
surfraw(1) search tools

SYNOPSIS

surfraw
elviname [options] search words ... 
sr elviname [options] search words ... 
sr elviname &minus;help 
sr &minus;elvi

DESCRIPTION

This is the man
page for the elvi, a set of search tools that form part of
surfraw(1).

Surfraw
provides a fast unix command line interface to a variety of
popular WWW search engines and other artifacts of power. It
reclaims google, altavista, dejanews, freshmeat, research
index, slashdot and many others from the false-prophet,
pox-infested heathen lands of html-forms, placing these
wonders where they belong, deep in unix heartland, as god
loving extensions to the shell.

To search using
this elvis, do:

sr elvisname
[options] search terms.

For example, to
search google for information on Debian ports, using the
"I&rsquo;m feeling lucky" option:

sr google
&minus;l debian ports

To find out
about options specific to this elvis, do:

sr elvisname
&minus;local&minus;help

To find out
about surfraw, see the man page for surfraw(1). To see the
full list of elvi, do:

sr
&minus;elvi

Adding the
elvi to your path 
If you are a regular user of surfraw, you will probably get
sick of typing sr or surfraw each time. You can regain the
old behaviour of running the elvi directly by adding the
elvi directory (- /usr/lib/surfraw) to your path, either
manually or using
surfraw&minus;update&minus;path(1).

OPTIONS

Use

sr elviname &minus;local-help for elvi-specific
options. 

The following
options work with all elvi.

&minus;help

Show summary of options (including elvi-specific
options). 

&minus;local-help

Show elvi-specific options.

&minus;version

Show version of program.

&minus;browser=EXECUTABLE

Set browser (default:
sensible&minus;browser).

&minus;elvi

Display a list of other Surfraw mechanisms for
conquering evil.

&minus;escape&minus;url&minus;args=yes|no

Apply url escaping to arguments
(default: yes)

&minus;q|&minus;quote

Bracket arguments with "
characters (default: no) Note that putting quotes round
arguments works now, so you can do, for example:

sr google foo
"bar baz" bam

and the quoting
is passed on to the search engine

EXAMPLES

$ sr ask why is
jeeves gay? 
$ surfraw google &minus;results=100 RMS, GNU, which is
sinner, which is sin? 
$ sr austlii &minus;method=phrase dog like 
$ /usr/lib/surfraw/rhyme &minus;method=perfect Julian
