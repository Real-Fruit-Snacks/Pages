USBD(8) BSD System Manager&rsquo;s Manual USBD(8)

NAME

usbd &mdash; supervise
USB attach/detach

SYNOPSIS

usbd
[&minus;c configfile] [&minus;d]
[&minus;e] [&minus;f device]
[&minus;n] [&minus;t timeout]
[&minus;v]

DESCRIPTION

The usbd utility handles
USB device attachment and detachment. It does two things.
Through opening the /dev/usb0, /dev/usb1, etc.
devices, it enables the kernel to handle change requests
from attached hubs. This functionality will be removed when
the kernel has kernel threads. The (multiple)
&minus;f device command line options specify
which controllers it should handle. Normally this option is
not needed.

If the
&rsquo;&rsquo;usb&rsquo;&rsquo;,
&rsquo;&rsquo;ohci&rsquo;&rsquo; and
&rsquo;&rsquo;uhci&rsquo;&rsquo; modules are not loaded,
usbd will load them automatically.

The second part
is the handling of the attachment and detachment of USB
devices. The device /dev/usb is opened and events are
read from it. Whenever a device is attached or detached the
list of actions read from /etc/usbd.conf is searched
for a matching entry. If found, the corresponding action is
executed.

The command line
options are as follows:

&minus;c
filename

Name of configuration file. The
default is /etc/usbd.conf.

&minus;d

Enable
debugging to the standard output, and do not disassociate
from the controlling terminal.

&minus;e

Do one device
tree exploration, no event queue handling and then exit.

&minus;f
device

Specify the pathname of a USB
controller device file. The flag may be repeated to watch
more than one USB controller. The default is
/dev/usb0 through /dev/usb3. Do not specify
the device /dev/usb here. It is used for events
only.

&minus;n

Do not handle
the event queue on /dev/usb.

&minus;t
timeout

Set the timeout interval (in
seconds) before an exploration happens without being
triggered by a connect or disconnect. A timeout of 0 means
that there is no timeout. The default is 30.

&minus;v

Be verbose.
Repeating the flag makes usbd more verbose.
