WCSNCMP(3POSIX)            POSIX Programmer's Manual           WCSNCMP(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       wcsncmp — compare part of two wide-character strings

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       int wcsncmp(const wchar_t *ws1, const wchar_t *ws2, size_t n);

DESCRIPTION
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with  the
       ISO C  standard.  Any  conflict between the requirements described here
       and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017
       defers to the ISO C standard.

       The  wcsncmp()  function  shall  compare not more than n wide-character
       codes (wide-character codes that follow a null wide-character code  are
       not  compared) from the array pointed to by ws1 to the array pointed to
       by ws2.

       The sign of a non-zero return value shall be determined by the sign  of
       the  difference  between the values of the first pair of wide-character
       codes that differ in the objects being compared.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, wcsncmp() shall return an  integer  greater
       than,  equal  to, or less than 0, if the possibly null-terminated array
       pointed to by ws1 is greater than, equal to, or less than the  possibly
       null-terminated array pointed to by ws2, respectively.

ERRORS
       No errors are defined.
