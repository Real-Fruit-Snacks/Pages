INET_ADDR(3POSIX)          POSIX Programmer's Manual         INET_ADDR(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       inet_addr, inet_ntoa — IPv4 address manipulation

SYNOPSIS
       #include <arpa/inet.h>

       in_addr_t inet_addr(const char *cp);
       char *inet_ntoa(struct in_addr in);

DESCRIPTION
       The inet_addr() function shall convert the string pointed to by cp,  in
       the standard IPv4 dotted decimal notation, to an integer value suitable
       for use as an Internet address.

       The inet_ntoa() function shall convert the Internet host address speci‐
       fied by in to a string in the Internet standard dot notation.

       The inet_ntoa() function need not be thread-safe.

       All  Internet  addresses  shall be returned in network order (bytes or‐
       dered from left to right).

       Values specified using IPv4 dotted decimal notation  take  one  of  the
       following forms:

       a.b.c.d   When four parts are specified, each shall be interpreted as a
                 byte of data and assigned, from left to right,  to  the  four
                 bytes of an Internet address.

       a.b.c     When  a  three-part address is specified, the last part shall
                 be interpreted as a 16-bit quantity and placed in the  right‐
                 most  two bytes of the network address. This makes the three-
                 part address format convenient for specifying Class B network
                 addresses as "128.net.host".

       a.b       When  a  two-part address is supplied, the last part shall be
                 interpreted as a 24-bit quantity and placed in the  rightmost
                 three  bytes  of the network address. This makes the two-part
                 address format convenient for specifying Class A network  ad‐
                 dresses as "net.host".

       a         When  only  one  part is given, the value shall be stored di‐
                 rectly in the network address without any byte rearrangement.

       All numbers supplied as parts in IPv4 dotted decimal  notation  may  be
       decimal,  octal,  or  hexadecimal,  as  specified in the ISO C standard
       (that is, a leading 0x or 0X implies hexadecimal; otherwise, a  leading
       '0' implies octal; otherwise, the number is interpreted as decimal).

RETURN VALUE
       Upon  successful  completion, inet_addr() shall return the Internet ad‐
       dress. Otherwise, it shall return (in_addr_t)(-1).

       The inet_ntoa() function shall return a pointer to the network  address
       in Internet standard dot notation.

ERRORS
       No errors are defined.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       The  return  value  of inet_ntoa() may point to static data that may be
       overwritten by subsequent calls to inet_ntoa().

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
