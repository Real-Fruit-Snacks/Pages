NAME

hardened-ld
&minus; linker wrapper to enforce hardening toolchain
improvements

SYNOPSIS

export
DEB_BUILD_HARDENING=1

ld
...

DESCRIPTION

The
hardened-ld wrapper is normally used by calling
ld as usual with DEB_BUILD_HARDENING set to 1.
It will configure the necessary toolchain hardening
features. By default, all features are enabled. If a given
feature does not work correctly and needs to be disabled,
the corresponding environment variables mentioned below can
be set to 0.

ENVIRONMENT

DEB_BUILD_HARDENING=1

Enable hardening features.

DEB_BUILD_HARDENING_DEBUG=1

Print the full resulting gcc
command line to STDERR before calling gcc.

DEB_BUILD_HARDENING_RELRO=0

Don&rsquo;t mark ELF sections
read-only after start. See README.Debian for details.

DEB_BUILD_HARDENING_BINDNOW=0

Don&rsquo;t mark ELF loader for
start-up dynamic resolution. See README.Debian for
details.

NOTES

System-wide
settings can be added to /etc/hardening-wrapper.conf,
one per line.

The real
ld is renamed ld.real, and a diversion is
registered with dpkg-divert(1). Thus
hardened-ld&rsquo;s idea of the default ld is
dictated by whatever package installed
/usr/bin/ld.
