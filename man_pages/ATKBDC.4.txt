ATKBDC(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual ATKBDC(4)

NAME

atkbdc â€” the AT
keyboard controller interface

SYNOPSIS

options KBD_RESETDELAY=N

options KBD_MAXWAIT=N 
options KBDIO_DEBUG=N 
device atkbdc

In
/boot/device.hints:

hint.atkbdc.0.at="isa"

hint.atkbdc.0.port="0x060"

DESCRIPTION

The keyboard controller
atkbdc provides I/O services for the AT keyboard and
PS/2 mouse style pointing devices. This controller is
required for the keyboard driver atkbd and the PS/2
pointing device driver psm.

There can be
only one atkbdc device configured in the system.

DRIVER CONFIGURATION

Kernel Configuration
Options 
The following kernel configuration options can be used to
control the atkbdc driver. They may be set in the
kernel configuration file (see config(8)).

KBD_RESETDELAY=X,
KBD_MAXWAIT=Y

The keyboard driver
atkbd and the pointing device driver psm may
ask the atkbdc driver to reset these devices during
the boot process. It sometimes takes a long time before
these devices respond to the reset command. These options
control how long the atkbdc driver should wait before
eventually giving up -- the driver will wait X *
Y msecs at most. If the drivers seem unable to detect
devices, you may want to increase these values. The default
values are 200 msec for X and 5 for Y.

KBDIO_DEBUG=N

Sets the debug level to
N. The default value is zero, which suppresses all
debugging output.
