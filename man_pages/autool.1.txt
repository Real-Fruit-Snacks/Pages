DESCRIPTION

The
autool program is a replacement for the Sun
audiotool program used to send audio files to Network
Audio System servers. It can be used either by making a
symbolic link name audiotool that points to
autool and is before the OpenWindows version or by
changing the OpenWindows deskset bindings database with the
binder(1) command.

OPTIONS

The following
options may be used with the autool program: 
-audio servername

This option specifies the
Network Audio System server on which the files should be
played.

-volume 0-100

This option specifies the
volume at which the data should be played as a percentage of
the maximum possible volume. The default is 10 percent.

-display
displayname

This option specifies the X
Window System on which the control panel should be
displayed.

-geom
geometry

This option specifies the
position and size of the control panel.

CONFIGURING OPENWINDOWS TO USE AUTOOL

OpenWindows
users can configure deskset applications to use
autool to play audio files through following
steps:

1.

Run the deskset configuration program binder.

2.

Locate the entry in the scrolling list named
audio-file click on it once with the left mouse
button. 

3.

From the Props menu, select the Icon...
entry with the right mouse button.

4.

Click on the button marked (+) in the lower right
corner with the left mouse button. This will expand the
window, adding another panel to the right.

5.

On the line marked Application in the panel on
the right, change ’’audiotool’’ to
’’autool’’ (you will need to specify
a full path name if you have not installed autool in
a directory in your path). The initial volume (which is a
percentage relative to the recorded level; the default is
10) can be increased by inserting the ’’-v
percent’’ option between
’’autool’’ and
’’$FILE’’. 

6.

Press the Apply button in the left panel.

7.

Back in the main binder window, press the
Save button in the upper left corner.

8.

Restart any deskset applications such as filemgr
to have the updated values take effect.

Double clicking
in filemgr on file names that end in .snd will
now cause autool to invoked.

ENVIRONMENT

The following
environment variables are used by autool: 
AUDIOSERVER

This variable specifies the
default audio server to contact if -audio is not
specified on the command line.

DISPLAY

If AUDIOSERVER is not set, this variable is
examined to find the name of the corresponding X Window
System display.
