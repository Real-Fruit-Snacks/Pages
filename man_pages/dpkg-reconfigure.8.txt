NAME

dpkg-reconfigure
- reconfigure an already installed package

SYNOPSIS

dpkg-reconfigure
[options] packages

DESCRIPTION

dpkg-reconfigure
reconfigures packages after they have already been
installed. Pass it the names of a package or packages to
reconfigure.

This has the
same effect as re-installing the package, basically. I hope
one day this will be called by dpkg --reconfigure

OPTIONS

-ftype,
--frontend=type

Select the frontend to use. The
default frontend can be permanently changed by:

dpkg-reconfigure
cdebconf

Note that if
you normally have cdebconf set to use the noninteractive
frontend, dpkg-reconfigure will use the dialog frontend
instead, so you actually get to reconfigure the package.

-pvalue,
--priority=value

Specify the minimum priority of
question that will be displayed. dpkg-reconfigure normally
shows low priority questions no matter what your default
priority is.

--all

Reconfigure all installed
packages that use cdebconf. Warning: this may take a long
time.

-u,
--unseen-only

By default, all questions are
shown, even if they have already been answered. If this
parameter is set though, only questions that have not yet
been seen will be asked.

--force

Force dpkg-reconfigure to
reconfigure a package even if the package is in an
inconsistent or broken state. Use with caution.

-h, --help

Display usage help.
