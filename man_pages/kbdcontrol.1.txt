KBDCONTROL(1) BSD General Commands Manual
KBDCONTROL(1)

NAME

kbdcontrol &mdash;
keyboard control and configuration utility

SYNOPSIS

kbdcontrol
[&minus;dFKix] [

&minus;b duration.pitch |
belltype ] [ 
&minus;r delay.repeat | speed ]
[&minus;l keymap_file]
[&minus;f # string]
[&minus;k keyboard_device]
[&minus;L keymap_file]

DESCRIPTION

The kbdcontrol command is
used to set various keyboard related options for the
syscons(4) console driver and the keyboard drivers, such as
key map, keyboard repeat and delay rates, bell
characteristics etc.

Keyboard options
may be automatically configured at system boot time by
setting variables in /etc/rc.conf. See Boot Time
Configuration below.

The following
command line options are supported:

&minus;b 
duration.pitch | belltype

Set the bell duration in
milliseconds and pitch in hertz. If a belltype
argument is specified, it may be one of normal which
sets sound parameters back to normal values, off
which disables the bell entirely, or visual which
sets the bell to visual mode, i.e., flashes the screen
instead. If belltype is preceded by the word
quiet., the bell will not be rung when the ringing
process is in the background vty.

&minus;r 
delay.repeat | speed

Set keyboard delay (250,
500, 750, 1000) and repeat (34, 38, 42, 46, 50, 55,
59, 63, 68, 76, 84, 92, 100, 110, 118, 126, 136, 152, 168,
184, 200, 220, 236, 252, 272, 304, 336, 368, 400, 440, 472,
504) rates, or if a speed argument is specified, it
may be one of slow (1000.504), fast (250.34)
or normal (500.126).

&minus;l
keymap_file

Install keyboard map file from
keymap_file. You may load the keyboard map file from
a menu-driven command, kbdmap(1).

&minus;d

Dump the
current keyboard map onto stdout. The output may be
redirected to a file and can be loaded back to the kernel
later by the &minus;l option above.

&minus;f #
string

Set function key number
# to send string. Refer to the man page for
the keyboard driver (e.g. atkbd(4)) for available function
keys and their numbers.

&minus;F

Set function
keys back to the standard definitions.

&minus;x

Use hexadecimal
numbers in keyboard map dump.

&minus;i

Print brief
information about the keyboard.

&minus;K

Disconnect the
keyboard from the console. You need to use the
&minus;k option below to associate a keyboard with
the console again.

&minus;k
keyboard_device

Use the specified device as the
console keyboard. When using this option, the standard input
of the kbdcontrol process should be redirected from
/dev/console if you are not working on the system
console (see the EXAMPLES section).

&minus;L
keymap_file

Load keyboard map file from
keymap_file and write the struct keymap
compiled from it to stdout. This option is primarily
intended for programmers and is probably of little use under
normal circumstances.

ENVIRONMENT

The environment variable
KEYMAP_PATH can hold an alternative path to the keyboard map
files.

KEYBOARD
CONFIGURATION

Boot Time Configuration

You may set variables in /etc/rc.conf or
/etc/rc.conf.local in order to configure the keyboard
at boot time. The following is the list of relevant
variables.

keymap

Specifies a
keyboard map file for the &minus;l option.

keyrate

Sets the
keyboard repeat rate for the &minus;r option.

keychange

Lists function
key strings for the &minus;f option.

See rc.conf(5)
for details.

Driver
Configuration 
The keyboard device driver may let you change default
configuration options, such as the default keyboard map, so
that you do not need to set up the options at boot time. See
keyboard driver manuals (e.g. atkbd(4), ukbd(4)) for
details.

FILES 
/usr/share/syscons/keymaps/*

keyboard map
files

EXAMPLES

The following command will load
the keyboard map file
/usr/share/syscons/keymaps/ru.koi8-r.kbd.

kbdcontrol -l
/usr/share/syscons/keymaps/ru.koi8-r.kbd

So long as the
keyboard map file resides in
/usr/share/syscons/keymaps, you may abbreviate the
file name as ru.koi8-r.

kbdcontrol -l
ru.koi8-r

The following
command will make the function key 10 emit "telnet
myhost".

kbdcontrol -f
10 "telnet myhost"

In order to get
the visual effect for bell, but prevent the screen from
flushing if the bell is to ring in the background screen,
run the following command.

kbdcontrol -b
quiet.visual

To change the
default console keyboard to the another keyboard, for
example the first USB keyboard (see ukbd(4)), use the
following commands.

kbdcontrol -k
/dev/kbd1 

To switch back
to the default keyboard, use this command.

kbdcontrol -k
/dev/kbd0

Report when found.
