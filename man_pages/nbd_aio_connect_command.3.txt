NAME

nbd_aio_connect_command
- connect to the NBD server

SYNOPSIS

#include

int nbd_aio_connect_command ( 
struct nbd_handle *h, char **argv 
);

DESCRIPTION

Run the command
as a subprocess and begin connecting to it over
stdin/stdout. Parameters behave as documented in
nbd_connect_command(3).

You can check
if the connection attempt is still underway by calling
nbd_aio_is_connecting(3). If
nbd_set_opt_mode(3) is enabled, the connection is
ready for manual option negotiation once
nbd_aio_is_negotiating(3) returns true; otherwise,
the connection attempt will include the NBD handshake, and
is ready for use once nbd_aio_is_ready(3) returns
true.

RETURN VALUE

If the call is
successful the function returns 0.

ERRORS

On error -1 is
returned.

Refer to
"ERROR HANDLING" in libnbd(3) for how to
get further details of the error.

The following
parameters must not be NULL: "h",
"argv". For more information see "Non-NULL
parameters" in libnbd(3).
