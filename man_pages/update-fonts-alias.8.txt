NAME

update&minus;fonts&minus;alias
&minus; compile fonts.alias files

SYNOPSIS

update&minus;fonts&minus;alias
[OPTION] directory ...

DESCRIPTION

update&minus;fonts&minus;alias
assembles a fonts.alias file in an X font directory
using one or more alias files found in a subdirectory of
/etc/X11/fonts/. It is typically invoked only from
the post&minus;installation and post&minus;removal scripts
of a package containing X Window System fonts that
provide aliases for their XLFD names, but may be invoked at
any time to reconstruct fonts.alias files. For each
directory, which is simply the last component of its
path (such as &rsquo;75dpi&rsquo; or &rsquo;misc&rsquo;),
update&minus;fonts&minus;alias will assemble either
/usr/lib/X11/fonts/directory/fonts.alias or
/usr/share/fonts/X11/directory/fonts.alias
from the files found in
/etc/X11/fonts/directory/package.alias.

This enables
multiple packages to provide aliases for fonts in the same
directory. No font package actually provides the
fonts.alias file in the X font directory itself, so
there is no danger of overwriting one package&rsquo;s
aliases with those of another.

For instance,
the two packages &rsquo;xfonts&minus;base&rsquo; and
&rsquo;xfonts&minus;base&minus;transcoded&rsquo; may both
install fonts into the directory
/usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc. They each place their
fonts.alias files in
/etc/X11/fonts/misc/xfonts&minus;base.alias and
/etc/X11/fonts/misc/xfonts&minus;base&minus;transcoded.alias
(respectively). update&minus;fonts&minus;alias
concatenates these two files (as well as any others that
match /etc/X11/fonts/misc/*.alias) into
/usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc/fonts.alias.

The format of
fonts.alias files is described in the
mkfontdir(1x) manual page.

An example of
how to use update&minus;fonts&minus;alias in package
maintainer scripts is provided in the Debian Policy
Manual.

OPTIONS

&minus;h,
&minus;&minus;help displays a brief usage message and
exits.

OPERANDS

update&minus;fonts&minus;alias
takes one or more X font directory names to operate on as
operands. Only the final path component of the directory
name should be specified; e.g.,

update&minus;fonts&minus;alias
75dpi

is correct, while
&rsquo;update&minus;fonts&minus;alias
/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi&rsquo; and
&rsquo;update&minus;fonts&minus;alias
/usr/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi&rsquo; are not.

ENVIRONMENT

COLUMNS

indicates the width of the
terminal device in character cells. This value is used for
formatting diagnostic messages. If not set, the terminal is
queried using stty(1) to determine its width. If that
fails, a value of &rsquo;80&rsquo; is assumed.

DIAGNOSTICS

Errors 
usage error: one or more font directories must be
provided

update&minus;fonts&minus;alias
was invoked without operands. Supply one or more X font
directory names to operate on.

usage error: unrecognized
option

update&minus;fonts&minus;alias
was invoked with an unrecognized option argument. Use only
the options documented in &ldquo;OPTIONS&rdquo;, above.

fatal error: path to X font
directory must be used

A directory name was supplied
that was not an X font directory name. Supply X font
directory names only.

Warnings

warning: absolute path directory was
provided

Usage of absolute paths is
deprecated. Use only the final component of the X font
directory name for directory.

warning:
directory does not exist or is not a
directory

The supplied directory
was invalid. update&minus;fonts&minus;alias skipped
it.

0

update&minus;fonts&minus;alias
ran successfully.

1

fatal error; see the section on diagnostic messages
above.
