NAME

scanlogs -
Summarize and rotate INN log files

SYNOPSIS

scanlogs
[norotate]

DESCRIPTION

scanlogs
summarizes the information recorded in the INN log files
which reside in the pathlog directory set in
inn.conf (see newslog(5) for further details about
these log files). It is normally invoked by the
news.daily(8) script which performs daily server maintenance
tasks.

It invokes
"ctlinnd flushlogs" to close the news and error
log files, rename them to add ".old" to the file
names and open fresh news and error logs; the active
file is also flushed to disk, along with the history
database.

By default,
scanlogs rotates and cleans out the logs. It keeps up
to logcycles old compressed log files in
pathlog/OLD (the logcycles parameter can be
set in inn.conf). scanlogs also keeps archives
of the active file in this directory.

It invokes
tally.control if newgroup.log or
rmgroup.log exists in pathlog (see the
control.log entry of newslog(5) for more information
about that).

scanlogs
displays the first 50 lines of errlog,
news.err and news.crit, if non-empty, and runs
innreport to summarize the contents of news,
news.notice and perl-nocem.log, and to update
the unwanted.log file amongst other things (see more
information about that in innreport(8)).

OPTIONS

Only one option
is currently accepted: 
norotate

Using this option disables the
rotating and cleaning aspect of the log processing: the logs
files are only scanned for information and no contents are
altered. If scanlogs is invoked more than once a day,
the norotate option should be used to prevent
premature log cleaning.

FILES

See newslog(5)
for the list of log files processed by scanlogs.
