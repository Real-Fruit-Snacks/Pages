NAME

sane-gphoto2 -
SANE backend for gphoto2 supported cameras

DESCRIPTION

The
sane-gphoto2 library implements a SANE (Scanner
Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to the digital
cameras supported by gphoto2. This backend has only been
tested with a handful of cameras so far. Patches to support
other models are welcome.

Because of the
limited testing of this backend, it is commented out in
/etc/sane.d/dll.conf by default. Either the comment
character must be removed or the backend must be called
explicitly. E.g. &rsquo;scanimage -d gphoto2&rsquo; or
&rsquo;xscanimage gphoto2&rsquo;.

DEVICE NAMES

The current
version of the backend only allows one camera to be
connected. The device name is always "0".

CONFIGURATION

The contents of
the gphoto2.conf specify the characteristics of the
camera to be used. Resolutions (high resolution, low
resolution, and thumbnail size) are required since they are
needed by the sane frontends, but can&rsquo;t be obtained
through the gphoto2 interface. Valid ports and cameras can
be obtained by "gphoto2 --list-cameras" and
"gphoto2 --list-ports".

The dumpinquiry
line causes some information about the camera to be
printed.

Empty lines and
lines starting with a hash mark (#) are ignored. A sample
configuration file is shown below:

The
"topfolder" line specifies the "fixed"
part of the file path. For example, on the Kodak DC-240,
files are stored in the directory /DCIM/100DC240. The /DCIM
portion is constant, but 100DC240 will change and must be
read from the camera. In this case, the line would read
"topfolder=/DCIM"

Some cameras
don&rsquo;t implement a file structure and store all
pictures in the "/" directory. This is indicated
by setting "subdirs=0" with
"topfolder=/"

FILES

/etc/sane.d/gphoto2.conf

The backend configuration file
(see also description of SANE_CONFIG_DIR below).

/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-gphoto2.a

The static library implementing
this backend.

/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-gphoto2.so

The shared library implementing
this backend (present on systems that support dynamic
loading).

ENVIRONMENT

SANE_CONFIG_DIR

This environment variable
specifies the list of directories that may contain the
configuration file. Under UNIX, the directories are
separated by a colon (&rsquo;:&rsquo;), under OS/2, they are
separated by a semi-colon (&rsquo;;&rsquo;). If this
variable is not set, the configuration file is searched in
two default directories: first, the current working
directory (".") and then in /etc/sane.d. If the
value of the environment variable ends with the directory
separator character, then the default directories are
searched after the explicitly specified directories. For
example, setting SANE_CONFIG_DIR to
"/tmp/config:" would result in directories
"tmp/config", ".", and
"/etc/sane.d" being searched (in this order).

SANE_DEBUG_GPHOTO2

If the library was compiled
with debugging support enabled, this environment variable
controls the debug level for this backend. A value of 128
requests maximally copious debug output; smaller levels
reduce verbosity.

GP_DEBUG

Set to 1, 2, or 3, to enable
various levels of debugging within the gphoto2
libraries.
