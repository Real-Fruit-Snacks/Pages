OPTIONS

CONFIGFILE
is the configuration file to use when starting the daemon.
The default configuration file is
/etc/sqlrelay/sqlrelay.conf.

ID is
just an identifier. Starting multiple connections with the
same ID make them available as a pool of connections.
The more connections you start, the more queries can be
executed in parallel. In addition, the ID argument
specifies which config file entry to use.

CONNECTIONID
is another identifier. When using replicated or clustered
databases, within a pool of connections, some connections
will connected to 1 machine and some will connect to
another. This argument tells the connection daemon which
machine to connect to. When not using clustered or
replicated databases, this id will be the same for every
connection in the pool.
