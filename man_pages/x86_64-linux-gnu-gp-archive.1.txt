NAME
       gp-archive - archive gprofng experiment data

SYNOPSIS
       gprofng archive [OPTION(S)] EXPERIMENT

DESCRIPTION
       Archive  the  associated  application  binaries  and  source files in a
       gprofng experiment to make it self contained and portable.

OPTIONS
       --version
              print the version number and exit.

       --help print usage information and exit.

       --verbose {on|off}
              enable (on) or disable (off) verbose mode; the default is "off".

       -a {off|on|ldobjects|src|usedldobjects|usedsrc}
              specify archiving of binaries and other files;  in  addition  to
              disable  this feature (off), or enable archiving off all loadob‐
              jects and sources (on), the other options support a more refined
              selection.  All  of these options enable archiving, but the key‐
              word controls what exactly is selected: all load objects  (ldob‐
              jects),  all source files (src), the loadobjects asscoiated with
              a program counter (usedldobjects), or the source  files  associ‐
              ated  with a program counter (usedsrc); the default is "-a ldob‐
              jects".

       -n     archive the named experiment only, not any of its descendants.

       -q     do not write any warnings to stderr; messages are  archived  and
              can be retrieved later.

       -F     force  writing  or rewriting of the archive; ignored with the -n
              or -m options, or if this is a subexperiment.

       -d <path>
              specifies the location of a common archive; this is a  directory
              that contains archived files.

       -m <regex>
              archive  only  those  source, object, and debug info files whose
              full path name matches the given POSIX compliant regular expres‐
              sion.

LIMITATIONS
       Default  archiving does not occur in case the application profiled ter‐
       minates prematurely, or if archiving is disabled  when  collecting  the
       performance  data.  In  such cases, this tool can be used to afterwards
       archive the information, but it has to run on the same system where the
       profiling data was recorded.

DOCUMENTATION
       A  getting started guide for gprofng is maintained as a Texinfo manual.
       If the info and gprofng programs are properly installed at  your  site,
       the command "info gprofng" should give you access to this document.
