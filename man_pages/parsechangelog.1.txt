    &minus;&minus;version, &minus;V               print version information
    &minus;&minus;file, &minus;l            changelog file to parse, defaults
                                to 'debian/changelog'
    &minus;F         ignored if changelogformat = 'debian'
                                for compatibility with dpkg&minus;dev
    &minus;L                  ignored for compatibility with dpkg&minus;dev
    &minus;&minus;format      see man page for list of available
                                output formats, defaults to 'dpkg'
                                for compatibility with dpkg&minus;dev
    &minus;&minus;since, &minus;s, &minus;v    include all changes later than version
    &minus;&minus;until, &minus;u        include all changes earlier than version
    &minus;&minus;from, &minus;f         include all changes equal or later
                                than version
    &minus;&minus;to, &minus;t           include all changes up to or equal
                                than version
    &minus;&minus;count, &minus;c, &minus;n     include  entries from the top
                                (or the tail if  is lower than 0)
    &minus;&minus;offset, &minus;o        change the starting point for &minus;&minus;count,
                                counted from the top (or the tail if
                                 is lower than 0)
    &minus;&minus;all                       include all changes

If neither
"changelogfile" nor "&minus;l
" are specified,
debian/changelog will be used. If two different files
are specified the program will abort.

If the filename
is "&minus;" the program reads the
changelog from standard input.

"&minus;&minus;all"
overrides all other range selecting options.
"&minus;&minus;count" overrides all other
range selection options except for
"&minus;&minus;all". The range selecting
options can be mixed together, but only one of
"&minus;&minus;since" and
"&minus;&minus;from" and one of
"&minus;&minus;until" and
"&minus;&minus;to" can be specified at
the same time.

The dpkg and
rfc822 formats default to showing only the first entry when
no other options are given with while the
HTML and XML formats default
to showing all entries.

For a more
extensive documentation of the range selecting options and
some (hopefully enlightening) examples see "
COMMON OUTPUT OPTIONS" in
Parse::DebianChangelog.

DESCRIPTION

parsechangelog
parses Debian changelogs as described in the Debian policy
(version 3.9.8 at the time of this writing) and converts
them to other output formats. See section " SEE
ALSO" for locations where to find the full
format definition.

The output
formats supported are currently: 
dpkg

Format as known from
dpkg&minus;parsechangelog(1). All requested entries
(see " SYNOPSIS" on how to select
specific entries) are returned in the usual Debian control
format, merged in one stanza, ready to be used in a
.changes file.

rfc822

Similar to the
"dpkg" format, but the requested entries
are returned as one stanza each, i.e. they are not merged.
This is probably the format to use if you want a
machine-usable representation of the changelog.

xml

Just a simple XML dump of the changelog
data. Without any schema or DTD currently,
just some made up XML. The actual format
might still change. Comments and Improvements welcome.

html

The changelog is converted to a
somewhat nice looking HTML file with some
nice features as a quick-link bar with direct links to every
entry. NOTE: This is not configurable yet and
was specifically designed to be used on
http://packages.debian.org/&gt;. This is planned to be
changed until version 1.0. The used Parse::DebianChangelog
module already supports configuration, however, this
isn&rsquo;t exposed by this program yet.

BUGS

Any version
given with "&minus;&minus;since",
"&minus;&minus;until",
"&minus;&minus;from", or
"&minus;&minus;to" must exist in the
changelogfile, else parsechangelog will a wrong result or
even abort with an error message. See
https://bugs.debian.org/576606&gt;
