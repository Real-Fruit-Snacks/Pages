NAME
       sane-mustek_usb - SANE backend for Mustek USB flatbed scanners

DESCRIPTION
       The sane-mustek_usb library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy)
       backend that provides access to Mustek USB flatbed scanners  (including
       a  clone  from Trust).  At present, the following scanners are known to
       work more or less with this backend:

              Mustek 600 CU
              Mustek 1200 UB
              Mustek 1200 CU
              Mustek 1200 CU Plus
              Trust Compact Scan USB 19200

       More  details  can  be  found  on  the  Mustek  USB  backend   homepage
       http://www.meier-geinitz.de/sane/mustek_usb-backend/.

       The  Mustek BearPaw 1200 and 2400 scanners are supported by the plustek
       backend. See sane-plustek(5) for details. The Mustek BearPaw  1200F  is
       supported by the MA-1509 backend. See sane-ma1509(5) for details. Other
       Mustek  USB  scanners  are  supported  by  the  gt68xx   backend,   see
       sane-gt68xx(5).

       This  backend  can only work with scanners that are already detected by
       the operating system. See sane-usb(5) for details.

       If you own a Mustek (or Trust) scanner other than the ones listed above
       that  works  with  this backend, please let me know this by sending the
       scanner's exact model name and the USB vendor and device ids (e.g. from
       /proc/bus/usb/devices or syslog) to me.

DEVICE NAMES
       This backend expects device names of the form:

              special

       Where special is a path-name for the special device that corresponds to
       a USB scanner.  With Linux, such a device name could be  /dev/usb/scan‐
       ner0 or /dev/usbscanner1, for example.

       For FreeBSD use /dev/uscanner0.

CONFIGURATION
       The  contents  of the mustek_usb.conf file is a list of options and de‐
       vice names that correspond to Mustek USB  scanners.   Empty  lines  and
       lines  starting  with  a hash mark (#) are ignored. If a device name is
       placed in mustek_usb.conf, it must be followed by a line containing the
       keyword option and an option specifying the scanner type. The following
       options can be used: 600cu, 1200cu, 1200cu_plus, 1200ub.  For the Trust
       Compact Scan USB 19200 use `option 1200ub'.

       Instead  of  using  the device name, the scanner can be autodetected by
       usb vendor_id product_id statements which  are  already  included  into
       mustek_usb.conf.   This  is  only supported with Linux 2.4.8 and higher
       and all systems that support libsub. "vendor_id" and  "product_id"  are
       hexadecimal  numbers that identify the scanner. If this doesn't work, a
       device name and the option specifying the scanner type must  be  placed
       in mustek_usb.conf as described above.

       The  global  option  max_block_size  can be used to limit the amount of
       data acquired in one turn from the USB system. It may be worth  trying,
       if USB errors occur.

       A sample configuration file is shown below:

              # Comment
              option max_block_size 1024
              usb 0x055f 0x0001
              /dev/usb/scanner0
              option 600cu

       The  first  line  is ignored. The second line sets the buffer size to a
       maximum of 1024 bytes.  The third line tries to  autodetect  a  scanner
       with  vendor  id  0x055f  and  product  id 0x0001 (Mustek 1200 CU). The
       fourth line tells the backend to attach to  /dev/usb/scanner0  and  the
       fifth line specifies that /dev/usb/scanner0 is a Mustek 600 CU.

FILES
       /etc/sane.d/mustek_usb.conf
              The   backend   configuration  file  (see  also  description  of
              SANE_CONFIG_DIR below).

       /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-mustek_usb.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-mustek_usb.so
              The shared library implementing this backend (present on systems
              that support dynamic loading).

ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_CONFIG_DIR
              This environment variable specifies the list of directories that
              may contain the configuration file.  On *NIX systems, the direc‐
              tories are separated by a colon (`:'), under OS/2, they are sep‐
              arated by a semi-colon (`;').  If this variable is not set,  the
              configuration  file  is  searched  in  two  default directories:
              first,  the  current  working  directory  (".")  and   then   in
              /etc/sane.d.  If the value of the environment variable ends with
              the directory separator character, then the default  directories
              are  searched  after  the explicitly specified directories.  For
              example, setting SANE_CONFIG_DIR to "/tmp/config:" would  result
              in directories tmp/config, ., and /etc/sane.d being searched (in
              this order).

       SANE_DEBUG_MUSTEK_USB
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this en‐
              vironment  variable  controls  the debug level for this backend.
              Higher debug levels increase the verbosity of the output.

              Value  Description
              0      no output
              1      print fatal errors
              2      print important messages
              3      print non-fatal errors and less important messages
              4      print all but debugging messages
              5      print high level debugging messages
              6      print medium level debugging messages
              7      print low level debugging messages

              Example: export SANE_DEBUG_MUSTEK_USB=4

AUTHOR
       Henning Meier-Geinitz <henning@meier-geinitz.de>
       This  backend  is based on the Mustek 1200ub backend from Mustek, main‐
       tained by Tom Wang.

BUGS
       These devices have a hardware bug: Once data is written to  them,  they
       can't  be  reset (toggle = DATA0). That means, any operation that tries
       to reset the device will result in running into timeouts.

       In earlier versions this backend failed when it was loaded  the  second
       time  in some configurations. The only choice was to replug the scanner
       in this case. The backend uses a workaround for that bug now  but  it's
       only  tested on Linux. Reports for other operating systems are appreci‐
       ated.

       More detailed bug information is available at the Mustek backend  home‐
       page http://www.meier-geinitz.de/sane/mustek_usb-backend/.
