NAME

passwd.nntp -
passwords for connecting to remote NNTP servers

DESCRIPTION

The file
/etc/news/passwd.nntp contains host-name-password
triplets for use when authenticating client programs to NNTP
servers. This file is normally interpreted by the
NNTPsendpassword routine in libinn(3). Blank
lines and lines beginning with a number sign
(’’#’’) are ignored. All other lines
should consist of three or four fields separated by
colons:

host:name:password 
host:name:password:style

The first field
is the name of a host, and is matched in a case-insensitive
manner. The second field is a user name, and the third is a
password. The optional fourth field specifies the type of
authentication to use. The default is
’’authinfo’’ which means that NNTP
’’authinfo’’ commands are used to
authenticate to the remote host. If either the username or
password are empty, then the related command will not be
sent. (The ’’authinfo’’ command is a
common extension to RFC 977.)

For
example:

## UUNET needs a password, MIT
doesn’t. 
mit.edu:bbn::authinfo 
uunet.uu.net:bbn:yoyoma:authinfo

This file
should not be world-readable.
