DESCRIPTION

void is
an dummy/null Xorg input driver. It doesn&rsquo;t connect to
any physical device, and it never delivers any events. It
functions as both a pointer and keyboard device, and may be
used as X server&rsquo;s core pointer and/or core keyboard.
It&rsquo;s purpose is to allow X servers pre version 1.4 to
operate without a core pointer and/or core keyboard.

CONFIGURATION DETAILS

Please refer to
xorg.conf(5) for general configuration details and for
options that can be used with all input drivers. This driver
doesn&rsquo;t have any configuration options in addition to
those.
