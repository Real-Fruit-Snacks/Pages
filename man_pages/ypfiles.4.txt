NAME

ypfiles &minus;
Network Information Service Version 2, formerly knows as
YP

DESCRIPTION

The NIS network
information service uses a distributed, replicated database
of dbm files (in ASCII form) contained in the
/var/yp directory hierarchy on each NIS server. NIS
has been replaced by NIS+, the new version of the Network
Information Service. See nis+(1). This release only
supports the client functionality of NIS, (see
ypclnt(3NSL)). The client functions are either
supported by the ypserv process running on a machine
with an earlier version of SunOS or by the NIS+ server in
"YP-compatibility" mode, (see
rpc.nisd(1M)).

A dbm
database served by the NIS server is called an NIS
map. An NIS domain is a subdirectory of
/var/yp containing a set of NIS maps on each NIS
server.

Standard
nicknames are defined in the file /var/yp/nicknames.
These names can be used in place of the full map name in the
ypmatch and ypcat commands. The command
ypcat -x can be used to display the current
set of nicknames. The command ypwhich -m can
be used to display all the available maps. Each line of the
nickname file contains two fields separated by white space.
The first field is the nickname and the second field is the
name of the map that it expands to. The nickname cannot
contain a ".".

NOTES

The NIS+
server, rpc.nisd, when run in "YP-compatibility
mode", can support NIS clients only for the standard
NIS maps listed below, provided that it has been set up to
serve the corresponding NIS+ tables using
nissetup(1M) and nisaddent(1M). The NIS+
server should serve the directory with the same name (case
sensitive) as the domainname of the NIS client. NIS+ servers
use secure RPC to verify client credentials but the NIS
clients do not authenticate their requests using secure RPC.
Therefore, NIS clients can look up the information stored by
the NIS+ server only if the information has "read"
access for an unauthenticated client (i.e. one with
"nobody" NIS+ credentials).
