MDCONFIG(8)

NAME

mdconfig &mdash;
configure and enable memory disks

SYNOPSIS

mdconfig &minus;a
&minus;t type [&minus;n] [

&minus;o [ 
no]option ] ...
[&minus;f file]
[&minus;s size]
[&minus;S sectorsize]
[&minus;u unit]
[&minus;x sectors/track]
[&minus;y heads/cyl]

mdconfig &minus;d
&minus;u unit 
mdconfig &minus;l [&minus;n]
[&minus;u unit]

DESCRIPTION

The mdconfig utility
configures and enables md(4) devices.

Options indicate
an action to be performed:

&minus;a

Attach a memory
disk. This will configure and attach a memory disk with the
parameters specified and attach it to the system.

&minus;d

Detach a memory
disk from the system and release all resources.

&minus;t type

Select the type of the memory
disk.

malloc

Storage for
this type of memory disk is allocated with malloc(9). This
limits the size to the malloc bucket limit in the kernel. If
the &minus;o reserve option is not set, creating and
filling a large malloc-backed memory disk is a very easy way
to panic a system.

vnode

A file
specified with &minus;f file becomes the
backingstore for this memory disk.

swap

swapspace is
used to back this memory disk.

&minus;f file

Filename to use for the vnode
type memory disk.

&minus;l

List
information about configured md(4) devices. If the
&minus;u option is used in conjuction with this, the
output is limited to information on the specified
device.

&minus;n

When printing
md device names, print only the unit number without the md
prefix.

&minus;s size

Size of the memory disk.
Size is the number of 512 byte sectors unless
suffixed with a k, m, or g which
denotes kilobyte, megabyte and gigabyte respectively.

&minus;S
sectorsize

Sectorsize to use for malloc
backed device.

&minus;x
sectors/track

See the description of the
&minus;y option below.

&minus;y
heads/cylinder

For malloc or
vnode backed devices, the &minus;x and
&minus;y options can be used to specify a synthetic
geometry. This is useful for constructing bootable images
for later download to other devices.

&minus;o [ 
no]option

Set or reset options.

[ 
no]async

For vnode backed
devices: avoid IO_SYNC for increased performance but at the
risk of deadlocking the entire kernel.

[ 
no]reserve

Allocate and reserve all needed
storage from the start, rather than as needed.

[ 
no]cluster

Enable clustering on this
disk.

[ 
no]compress

Enable/Disable compression
features to reduce memory usage.

[ 
no]force

Disable/Enable extra sanity
checks to prevent the user from doing something that might
adversely affect the system.

[ 
no]readonly

Enable/Disable readonly
mode.

&minus;u unit

Request a specific unit number
for the md(4) device instead of automatic allocation.

EXAMPLES

To create a 4 megabyte malloc(9)
backed memory disk. The name of the allocated unit will be
output on stdout like &rsquo;&rsquo;md3&rsquo;&rsquo;:

mdconfig -a -t
malloc -s 4m

To create a disk
named /dev/md4 with /tmp/boot.flp as
backing:

mdconfig -a -t
vnode -f /tmp/boot.flp -u 4

To detach and
free all resources used by /dev/md4:

mdconfig -d -u
4

To create and
mount a 128MByte swap backed file system on /tmp:

mdconfig -a -t
swap -s 128M -u 10 
newfs -U /dev/md10 
mount /dev/md10 /tmp 
chmod 1777 /tmp

To create a 5MB
file-backed disk:

dd if=/dev/zero
of=somebackingfile bs=1k count=5k 
mdconfig -a -t vnode -f somebackingfile -u 0 
bsdlabel -w md0 auto 
newfs md0c 
mount /dev/md0c /mnt

HISTORY

The mdconfig utility
first appeared in FreeBSD 5.0 as a cleaner replacement
for the vn(4) and vnconfig(8) combo.
