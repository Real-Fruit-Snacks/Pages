NAME

sane-epjitsu -
SANE backend for Epson-based Fujitsu USB scanners.

DESCRIPTION

The
sane-epjitsu library implements a SANE (Scanner
Access Now Easy) backend which provides basic access the
Fujitsu fi-60F/fi-65F and ScanSnap S300/S1300(i)/S1100(i)
scanners.

HARDWARE SUPPORT

These scanners
are fairly limited, only supporting a couple of modes and
resolutions, and always scanning full width. The backend
supports missing modes (binary, grayscale) and intermediate
resolutions in software, but provides only minimal scan area
controls. See KNOWN ISSUES.

This backend
may support other scanners. If physical inspection reveals
an Epson chipset, please contact the author for instructions
on collecting a USB trace under Windows to verify.

OPTIONS

A limited
effort has been made to expose the standard options to the
API. This allows a frontend to set resolution, color mode,
and choose the ADF setting. The epjitsu backend supports the
following basic options for most scanners:

source s

Selects the source for the
scan. Options may include "Flatbed", "ADF
Front", "ADF Back", "ADF
Duplex".

mode m

Selects the mode for the scan.
Options may include "Lineart", "Gray",
"Color".

resolution,
y-resolution

Controls scan resolution.
Setting --resolution also sets --y-resolution, though this
behavior is overridden by some frontends.

Other options
will be available based on the capabilities of the scanner.
Use ’scanimage --help’ to get a list. Be aware
that some options may appear only when another option has
been set, and that advanced options may be hidden by the
frontend.

CONFIGURATION FILE

The
configuration file "/etc/sane.d/epjitsu.conf" is
used to tell the backend how to look for scanners, and
provide options controlling the operation of the backend.
This file is read each time the frontend asks the backend
for a list of scanners, generally only when the frontend
starts. If the configuration file is missing, the backend
will not work.

Scanners can be
specified in the configuration file in two ways:

"usb
0x04c5 0x10c7" (or other vendor/product ids)

Requests backend to search all
usb buses in the system for a device which uses that vendor
and product id. The device will then be queried to determine
if it is a supported scanner.

"usb
/dev/usb/scanner0" (or other device file)

Some systems use a kernel
driver to access usb scanners. This method is untested.

The only
configuration option supported is "firmware
/PATH/TO/FILE", allowing you to set the location of the
firmware file you have extracted from the Windows
driver.

Note:
This firmware is a copyrighted work of Fujitsu, so cannot be
provided by the backend or the author. Please do not
ask.

Note:
These scanners REQUIRE a firmware file to function. See the
supplied configuration file for more detail.

Note:
This option may appear multiple times in the configuration
file. It only applies to scanners discovered by
’usb’ lines that follow this option.

ENVIRONMENT

The backend
uses a single environment variable, SANE_DEBUG_EPJITSU,
which enables debugging output to stderr. Valid values
are:

5 Errors 
10 Function trace 
15 Function detail 
20 Option commands 
25 USB trace 
30 USB detail 
35 Useless noise

KNOWN ISSUES

Only limited
scan area options are exposed. 
fi-60F and fi-65F hardware grayscale mode is not used,
because the calibration code is not finished.
