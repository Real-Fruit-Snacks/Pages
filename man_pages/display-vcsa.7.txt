NAME

display-vcsa
: Display using Linux virtual console text device

SYNOPSIS

display-vcsa :
[ [-noinput] | [ [-nokbd] [-nomouse] ] ] [-shade] 
[-ascii] [-physz=,[dpi]] []

DESCRIPTION

Uses the Linux
/dev/vcsa* devices to render text modes onto the
console.

OPTIONS

-nokbd

Do not open any libraries for
keyboard input.

-nomouse

Do not open any libraries for
mouse input.

-noinput

Same as both -nokbd and
-nomouse.

-shade

The -shade option turns on shading mode,
which changes the color mapping so that it chooses
characters which emulate a shading effect. This makes a big
improvement if using (some might say abusing :) the vcsa
target for graphical purposes.

-ascii

The -ascii option limits the color mapping to
only using ASCII characters. The default mode uses IBM
special characters (the solid block mainly, and others when
using -shade).

-physz=,[dpi]

This option will provide a
physical screen size for applications which wish to remain
resolution independent. sizex, sizey are the
x,y size of the screen in millimeters, unless the optional
dpi string is affixed, in which case, they represent
resolution in dots-per-inch.

vcsa device

The filename of the device
file, defaulting to /dev/vcsa which draws on the
current virtual console.
