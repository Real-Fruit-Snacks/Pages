NAME
       mate-doc-common - include the standard user documentation build files

SYNOPSIS
       mate-doc-common

DESCRIPTION
       This  script is used by mate-autogen to include the standard user docu-
       mentation build files in a MATE package.

       To automatically include the standard user  documentation  build  files
       (omf.make    and   xmldocs.make)   in   you   package,   set   USE_COM-
       MON_DOC_BUILD=yes in autogen.sh before  calling  the  macros/autogen.sh
       script.

       When  porting  applications across to use this feature, ensure that all
       of the references to xmldocs.make are to $(top_srcdir)/xmldocs.make  in
       the  appropriate  Makefile.am  files.  Some  modules  assume  that xml-
       docs.make is in another directory (like docs/ or something).

OPTIONS
       --help Display the help of the script.

       --version
              Show the script version.

       --copy Copy files instead of make symlinks.
