NAME

ax25d - General
purpose AX.25, NET/ROM and Rose daemon

SYNOPSIS

ax25d [-v]
[-c altconffile] [-l]

DESCRIPTION

Ax25d is
a general purpose server daemon that listens on a number of
AX.25, NET/ROM and Rose ports and offers different services
depending upon port, callsign and other parameters.
Ax25d is driven by a complex configuration file, a
full description of which may be found in another manual
page.

AX25d
has the facility to log information about incoming
connections to the system log file. By default no logging is
done. When ax25d is running, and a change in the
configuration file is made, ax25d can be forced to
re-read its configuration file by sending it a SIGHUP.

OPTIONS

-c altconffile

-l

log file. By default no messages are logged.
