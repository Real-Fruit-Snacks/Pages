NAME
       sane-teco1 - SANE backend for TECO / RELISYS scanners

DESCRIPTION
       The  sane-teco1  library  implements  a  SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy)
       backend that provides access to some TECO SCSI flatbed  scanners.  This
       backend  should  be considered beta-quality software! TECO scanners are
       sold under various brands like RELISYS, PIOTECH,  TRUST.  This  backend
       may or may not support yours.

       The scanners that should work with this backend are:

       Note  that  the  untested  scanner  will not be directly supported. You
       should contact the author for that.

       The TECO VM number can usually be found at the back of the scanner.  It
       is  also  part  of the FCC ID.  sane-find-scanner -v will also show the
       SCSI inquiry, and if it is a TECO scanner, the name will be there too.

       The options the backend supports can either be selected through command
       line  options  to programs like scanimage(1) or through GUI elements in
       xscanimage(1) or xsane(1).

       If you have any success with a scanner not listed here, or if  you  no‐
       tice  any  strange behavior, please report to the backend maintainer or
       to the SANE mailing list.

       Valid command line options and their syntax can be listed by using:

              scanimage --help -d teco1

       Scan Mode

       --mode Black & White|Grayscale|Color
              Selects the basic  mode  of  operation  of  the  scanner.  Valid
              choices are Black & White, Grayscale and Color.

              The  Black  &  White  mode  is for black and white only (1 bit).
              Grayscale will produce 256 levels of gray (8 bits).  Color  will
              produce a 24 bit color image.

       --resolution 1..600
              Selects  the resolution for a scan. The scanner can do all reso‐
              lutions between 1 and 600, in increments of 1.

       Geometry options

       -l -t -x -y
              Controls the scan area: -l sets the top left  x  coordinate,  -t
              the  top  left  y  coordinate,  -x  selects the width and -y the
              height of the scan area. All parameters are  specified  in  mil‐
              limeters by default.

       Enhancement options

       --custom-gamma
              (color  mode only) allows the user to specify a gamma table (see
              the next 3 parameters).

       --red-gamma-table
              Can be used to download a user defined gamma table for  the  red
              channel.  The table must be 256 bytes long. Color mode only.

       --green-gamma-table
              Can be used to download a user defined gamma table for the green
              channel.  The table must be 256 bytes long. Color mode only.

       --blue-gamma-table
              Can be used to download a user defined gamma table for the  blue
              channel.  The table must be 256 bytes long. Color mode only.

       --dither Line art|2x2|3x3|4x4 bayer|4x4 smooth|8x8 bayer|8x8 smooth|8x8
       horizontal|8x8 vertical
              Select the dither mask to use. Black & White only.

       --preview
              Requests a preview scan. The resolution used is 22 dpi  and  the
              scan  area  is  the  maximum  allowed. The scan mode is user se‐
              lected. The default is "no".

CONFIGURATION FILE
       The configuration file /etc/sane.d/teco1.conf supports only  one  item:
       the device name to use (eg /dev/scanner).

FILES
       /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-teco1.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-teco1.so
              The shared library implementing this backend (present on systems
              that support dynamic loading).

ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_DEBUG_TECO1
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this en‐
              vironment  variable  controls  the debug level for this backend.
              E.g., a value of 128 requests all debug output  to  be  printed.
              Smaller levels reduce verbosity.

LIMITATIONS
       The  windows TWAIN driver has many more options than this SANE backend.
       However they are only software adjustments. This  backend  only  imple‐
       ments what the scanner can support.

BUGS
       None known.
