DESCRIPTION

Queries the
GNATS database according to options and returns
either selected Problem Reports (PRs) or other
requested information. query-pr can query PRs
located in either a local database or via gnatsd.

PRs may
be selected via the use of the −−expr
option, directly by number, or by the use of the (now
deprecated) field-specific query operators.

By default,
query options are connected with a logical AND. For
example,

query−pr
−−category=foo
−−responsible=bar

only prints PRs which have a
Category field of foo and a Responsible
field of bar.

The
−−or option may be used to connect query
options with a logical OR. For example,

query−pr
−−category=baz −−or
−−responsible=blee

prints PRs which have either a
Category field of baz or a Responsible
field of blee.

The use of
these options is strongly discouraged, as they will be
deleted in the next release. The expressions specified by
the −−expr option are much more
flexible.

OPTIONS

−−help, −h

Prints a (rather longish) help
message.

−−version, −V

Displays the program version to
stdout.

−−output file, −o file

The results of the query will
be placed in this file.

−−database database, −d database

Specifies the database to be
used for the query. If no database is specified, the
database named default is assumed. (This option
overrides the database specified in the GNATSDB
environment variable; see the ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
section for more information.)

−−list−categories, −j

Lists the available PR
categories for the selected database.

−−list−classes, −J

Lists the available PR
classes for the selected database.

−−list−responsible, −k

Lists the users that appear in
the database’s responsible list.

−−list−submitters, −l

Lists the valid submitters for
this database.

−−list−states, −T

Lists the valid PR
states for PRs in this database.

The previous
−−list-* options are deprecated and will
be removed in the next release; their functionality can be
replaced with

query-pr
−−valid-values field

where
field is one of Category, Class,
Responsible, Submitter-Id, or State.

−−list−databases

Lists the known databases.

−−list−fields

Lists the entire set of field
names for PRs in the selected database.

−−list−input−fields

Lists the fields that should be
provided when creating a new PR for the
currently-specified database. The fields are listed in an
order that would make sense when used in a template or
form.

−−field−type field

Returns the data type contained
in PR field field. The current set of data
types includes text, multitext, enum,
multienum, integer, date, and
text-with-regex-qualifier.

−−field−description field

Returns a human-readable
description of the intended purpose of field.

−−valid−values field

For fields of type enum,
a list of valid values (one per line) is returned.
Otherwise, a regular expression is returned that describes
the legal values in field.

−−responsible−address name

The mail address of name
is returned; name is assumed to be a name either
appearing in the database’s responsible list,
or is otherwise a user on the system.

−−print−sh−vars

A set of /bin/sh
variables is returned that describe the selected database.
They include: 
GNATSDB

The name of the
currently-selected database.

GNATSDB_VALID

Set to 1 if the selected
database is valid.

GNATSDBDIR

The directory where the
database contents are stored.

DEBUG_MODE

Set to 1 if debug mode has been
enabled for the database.

DEFAULTCATEGORY

The default category for
PRs in the database.

DEFAULTSTATE

The default state for
PRs in the database.

−−print−directory−for−database

Returns the directory where the
selected database is located.

−−format format, −f format

Used to specify the format of
the output PRs, See FORMATS below for a complete
description.

−−full, −F

When printing PRs, the
entre PR is displayed. This is exactly equivalent to

query-pr
−−format full

−−summary, −q

When printing PRs, a
summary format is used. This is exactly equivalent to

query-pr
−−format summary

−−debug, −D

Enables debugging output for
network queries.

−−host host, −H host

Specifies the hostname of the
gnatsd server to communicate with. This overrides the
value in the GNATSDB environment variable.

−−port port

Specifies the port number of
the gnatsd server to communicate with. This overrides
the value in the GNATSDB environment variable.

−−user user, −v user

Specifies the username to login
with when connecting to the gnatsd server. This
overrides the value in the GNATSDB environment
variable.

−−passwd passwd, −w passwd

Specifies the password to login
with when connecting to the gnatsd server. This
overrides the value in the GNATSDB environment
variable.

−−and, −&,
−−or, −|,

These options are used when
connecting multiple query operators together. They specify
whether the previous and subsequent options are to be
logically ANDed or logically ORed.

−−expr expr

Specifies a query expression to
use when searching for PRs. See the QUERY EXPRESSIONS
section.

The remaining
deprecated options are not described here, since their use
is fairly obvious and their functionality is completely
replaced by the use of the −−expr option.
(Some sort of shorthand option for querying fields may
appear in the next release.)

FORMATS

Printing
formats for PRs are in one of three forms: 
formatname

This is a named format
which is described by the database (specifically, these
formats are described in the dbconfig file associated
with the database). The default configuration contains five
such formats: standard, full, summary,
sql, and sql2.

The first three
are the ones most commonly used when performing queries.
standard is the format used by default if no other
format is specified.

Use of the
latter two are discouraged; they are merely kept for
historical purposes.

Other named
formats may have been added by the database
administrator.

fieldname

A single field name may appear
here. Only the contents of this field will be displayed.

´"printf
string" fieldname fieldname . . .´

This provides a
rather flexible mechanism for formatting PR output.
(The formatting is identical to that provided by the named
formats described by the database configuration.) The printf
string can contain the following % sequences:

%[positionalspecifiers]s:
Prints the field as a string. The positional specifiers are
similar to those of printf, as +, - and digit qualifiers can
be used to force a particular alignment of the field
contents.

%[positionalspecifiers]S:
Similar to %s, except that the field contents are terminated
at the first space character.

%[positionalspecifiers]d:
Similar to %s, except that the field contents are written as
a numeric value. For integer fields, the value is written as
a number. For enumerated fields, the field is converted into
a numeric equivalent (i.e. if the field can have two
possible values, the result will be either 1 or 2). For date
fields, the value is written as seconds since Jan 1,
1970.

%F: The
field is written as it would appear within a PR,
complete with field header.

%D: For
date fields, the date is written in a standard GNATS
format.

%Q: For
date fields, the date is written in an arbitrary
"SQL" format.

An example
printf formatted query (note the quoting of the whole format
specification):

query-pr
--format ’"%s, %s" Synopsis State’

QUERY EXPRESSIONS

Query
expressions are used to select specific PRs based on
their field contents. The general form is

fieldname|"value"
operator fieldname|"value"
[booleanop ...]

value is
a literal string or regular expression; it must be
surrounded by double quotes, otherwise it is interpreted as
a fieldname.

fieldname
is the name of a field in the PR.

operator
is one of:

=

The value of the left-hand side of the expression must
exactly match the regular expression on the right-hand side
of the expression.

~

Some portion of the left-hand side of the expression
must match the regular expression on the right-hand
side. 

==

The value of the left-hand side must be equal to the
value on the right-hand side of the expression.

The equality of
two values depends on what type of data is stored in the
field(s) being queried. For example, when querying a field
containing integer values, literal strings are interpreted
as integers. The query expression

Number ==
"0123"

is identical
to

Number ==
"123"

as the leading
zero is ignored. If the values were treated as strings
instead of integers, then the two comparisons would return
different results.

!=

The not-equal operator. Produces
the opposite result of the == operator.

,>

The left-hand side must have a value less than or
greater than the right-hand side. Comparisons are done
depending on the type of data being queried; in particular,
integer fields and dates use a numeric comparison, and
enumerated fields are ordered depending on the numeric
equivalent of their enumerated values.

booleanop
is either | [or], or & [and]. The query expression

Category="baz" |
Responsible="blee"

is identical to the second
query example with −−or given earlier; it
selects all PRs with a Category field of baz
or a Responsible field of blee.

The not
operator ! may be used to negate a test:

! Category="foo"

searches for PRs where
the category is not equal to the regular expression
foo.

Parenthesis may
be used to force a particular interpretation of the
expression:

!(Category="foo"
& Submitter-Id="blaz")

skips PRs where the
Category field is equal to foo and the
Submitter-Id field is equal to blaz.
Parenthesis may be nested to any arbitrary depth.

Fieldnames can
be specified in several ways. The simplest and most obvious
is just a name:

Category="foo"

checks the value of the
category field for the value "foo".

A fieldname
qualifier may be prepended to the name of the field; a colon
is used to separate the qualifier from the name. To refer
directly to a builtin field name:

builtin:Number="123"

In this case,
Number is interpreted as the builtin name of the
field to check. (This is useful if the fields have been
renamed. For more discussion of builtin field names, see
dbconfig(5).)

To scan all
fields of a particular type, the fieldtype qualifier
may be used:

fieldtype:Text="bar"

searches all
text fields for the regular expression bar.

Note that it is
not necessary that the right-hand side of the expression be
a literal string. To query all PRs where the
PR has been modified since it was closed, the
expression

Last-Modified
!= Closed-Date

will work; for
each PR, it compares the value of its Last-Modified
field against its Closed-Date field, and returns those
PRs where the values differ. However, this query will
also return all PRs with empty Last-Modified or
Closed-Date fields. To further narrow the search:

Last-Modified
!= Closed-Date & Last-Modified != "" &
Closed-Date != ""

In general,
comparing fields of two different types (an integer field
against a date field, for example) will probably not do what
you want.

Also, a field
specifier may be followed by the name of a subfield in
braces:

State[type] !=
"closed"

or even

builtin:State[type]
!= "closed"

Subfields are
further discussed in dbconfig(5).

QUERY BY MAIL

query-pr
can also be accessed by electronic mail, if your version of
GNATS is configured for this. To use this feature, simply
send mail to the address query-pr@your-site
with command line arguments or options in the
Subject: line of the mail header. GNATS replies to
your mail with the results of your query. The default
settings for the query-pr mail server are shown
below; to override the −−state parameter,
specify −−state=state in the
Subject: line of the mail header. You can not query
on confidential Problem Reports by mail. 
−−restricted
−−state="open|analyzed|feedback|suspended"

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

The
GNATSDB environment variable is used to determine
which database to use. For a local database, it contains the
name of the database to access.

For network
access via gnatsd, it contains a colon-separated list
of strings that describe the remote database in the form

server:port:databasename:username:password

Any of the
fields may be omitted except for server, but at least
one colon must appear; otherwise, the value is assumed to be
the name of a local database.

If
GNATSDB is not set, it is assumed that the database
is local and that its name is default.
