SIGINTERRUPT(3POSIX)       POSIX Programmer's Manual      SIGINTERRUPT(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       siginterrupt — allow signals to interrupt functions

SYNOPSIS
       #include <signal.h>

       int siginterrupt(int sig, int flag);

DESCRIPTION
       The siginterrupt() function shall change the restart  behavior  when  a
       function is interrupted by the specified signal. The function siginter‐
       rupt(sig, flag) has an effect as if implemented as:

           int siginterrupt(int sig, int flag) {
               int ret;
               struct sigaction act;

               (void) sigaction(sig, NULL, &act);
               if (flag)
                   act.sa_flags &= ~SA_RESTART;
               else
                   act.sa_flags |= SA_RESTART;
               ret = sigaction(sig, &act, NULL);
               return ret;
           }

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, siginterrupt() shall return  0;  otherwise,
       -1 shall be returned and errno set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The siginterrupt() function shall fail if:

       EINVAL The sig argument is not a valid signal number.

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       The  siginterrupt()  function  supports  programs written to historical
       system interfaces.  Applications should use the  sigaction()  with  the
       SA_RESTART flag instead of the obsolescent siginterrupt() function.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
