Performance Co-Pilot JSON dumping utility

SYNOPSIS

pmjson
[-mpqyV?] [-i infile] [-o

DESCRIPTION

pmjson
is used to manipulate JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
formatted text used in the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP
toolkit). It can produce minimal and human readable output
formats when it is supplied with valid JSON input.

OPTIONS

The available
command line options are: 
-i infile, --in=infile

JSON formatted input
infile - path to a file from which input should be
read. If this option is omitted, then pmjson will
read from the standard input stream.

-m, --minimal

Produce JSON output with all
superflous whitespace removed from the resulting JSON
string.

-o outfile,
--out=outfile

Formatted output is written to
the named outfile. If this option is omitted, then
pmjson will write to the standard output stream.

-p, --pretty

Produce JSON output in a
human-readable format.

-q, --quiet

Verify the input as valid JSON
only, no output is produced.

-V, --version

Display version number and
exit.

-y, --yaml

Produce YAML-like output, a
human-readable format with less syntactic sugar than
JSON.

-?, --help

PCP ENVIRONMENT

Environment
variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On
each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains
the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).
