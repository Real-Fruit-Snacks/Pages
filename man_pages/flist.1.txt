is equivalent to flist

DESCRIPTION

flist is
used to search a list of folders and display the number of
messages in these folders that are in a given sequence or
set of sequences (for example the
“unseen” sequence). This is especially
useful if you use some mechanism such as slocal or
procmail (typically in conjunction with
rcvstore) to pre-sort your mail into different
folders before you view it.

By default, the
command flist will search the current folder for the
given sequence or sequences (usually
“unseen”). If (possibly multiple) folders
are specified on the command line with +folder, then
all these folders are searched for the given sequence(s).
flist will display for each folder searched, the
number of messages in each of the specified sequences, and
the total number of messages.

The
-sequence switch specifies the sequence to which
messages should belong. This switch may be given multiple
times to specify multiple sequences. If it is not given,
then the default is to search for all the sequences
specified by the “Unseen-Sequence”
profile component. For more details about sequences, read
mh-sequence(5).

Typically,
flist will produce a line for each sequence, for
every folder that is searched, even those which do not
contain any messages in the given sequence. Specifying
-noshowzero will cause flist to print only
those folder/sequence combinations where the folder has a
non-zero number of messages in the given sequence.

If
-recurse is given, then for each folder that is
searched, flist will also recursively descend into
those folders to search subfolders for the given
sequence.

If -fast
is given, only the names of the folders searched will be
displayed, and flist will suppress all other output.
If this option is used in conjunction with
-noshowzero, then flist will only print the
names of those folders searched that contain messages in in
at least one of the specified sequences.

Multiple
Folders 
If the -all switch is given (and no folders are
specified with +folder), then flist will
search all the folders in the top level of the users nmh
directory. These folders are all preceded by the read-only
folders, which occur as “atr-cur-”
entries in the user’s nmh context.

An example of
the output of flist -all is:

/work/Mail has
5 in sequence unseen (private); out of 46 
inbox+ has 10 in sequence unseen ; out of 153 
junklist has 0 in sequence unseen ; out of 63 
postmaster has 1 in sequence unseen ; out of 3

The
“+” after inbox indicates that it is the
current folder.

The
“private” flag indicates that the given sequence
for that folder is private. See mh-sequence(5) for
details about private sequences.

If the option
-all and +folder are both specified, then
flist will search this folder, and all its first
level subfolders for the given sequence. You may specify
multiple folders in this way.

If flist
is invoked by a name ending with “s” (e.g.
flists), then the switch -all is assumed by
default.

The sorting
order for the listing is alphabetical (with -alpha),
or in a priority order defined by the
“Flist-Order” profile entry (with
-noalpha). Each item in the
“Flist-Order” is a folder name or a
folder name pattern that uses * to match zero or more
characters. Longer matching patterns have precedence over
shorter matching patterns. For example:

Flist-Order:
personal petproject mh* * admin *junk

This order puts
a few interesting folders first, such as those with mail
addressed to you personally, those about a pet project, and
those about mh-related things. It places uninteresting
folders at the end, and it puts everything else in the
middle in alphabetical order.

FILES

$HOME/.mh_profile

The user’s profile.

PROFILE COMPONENTS

Path:

To determine the user’s
nmh directory.

mh-sequences:

File that contains public sequences.

Unseen-Sequence:

The name of the unseen message sequence.

The Unseen-Sequence profile
entry.

CONTEXT

If +folder is given, it
will become the current folder. If multiple folders are
given, the last one specified will become the current
folder.
