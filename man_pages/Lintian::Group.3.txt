Lintian::Group(3)           Debian Package Checker           Lintian::Group(3)

NAME
       Lintian::Group -- A group of objects that Lintian can process

SYNOPSIS
        use Lintian::Group;

        my $group = Lintian::Group->new('lintian_2.5.0_i386.changes');

DESCRIPTION
       Instances of this perl class are sets of processables.  It allows at
       most one source and one changes or buildinfo package per set, but
       multiple binary packages (provided that the binary is not already in
       the set).

METHODS
       $group->pooldir
           Returns or sets the pool directory used by this group.

       $group->source_name
       $group->source_version
       $group->binary
           Returns a hash reference to the binary processables in this group.

       $group->buildinfo
           Returns the buildinfo processable in this group.

       $group->changes
           Returns the changes processable in this group.

       $group->source
           Returns the source processable in this group.

       $group->udeb
           Returns a hash reference to the udeb processables in this group.

       jobs
           Returns or sets the max number of jobs to be processed in parallel.

           If the limit is 0, then there is no limit for the number of
           parallel jobs.

       processing_start
       processing_end
       cache
           Cache for some items.

       profile
           Hash with active jobs.

       "saved_direct_dependencies"
       "saved_direct_reliants"
       $group->name
           Returns a unique identifier for the group based on source and
           version.

       process
           Process group.

       $group->add_processable($proc)
           Adds $proc to $group.  At most one source and one changes $proc can
           be in a $group.  There can be multiple binary $proc's, as long as
           they are all unique.  Successive buildinfo $proc's are silently
           ignored.

           This will error out if an additional source or changes $proc is
           added to the group. Otherwise it will return a truth value if $proc
           was added.

       get_processables
           Returns an array of all processables in $group.

       get_installables
           Returns all binary (and udeb) processables in $group.

           If $group does not have any binary processables then an empty list
           is returned.

       direct_dependencies (PROC)
           If PROC is a part of the underlying processable group, this method
           returns a listref containing all the direct dependencies of PROC.
           If PROC is not a part of the group, this returns undef.

           Note: Only strong dependencies (Pre-Depends and Depends) are
           considered.

           Note: Self-dependencies (if any) are not included in the result.

       direct_reliants (PROC)
           If PROC is a part of the underlying processable group, this method
           returns a listref containing all the packages in the group that
           rely on PROC.  If PROC is not a part of the group, this returns
           undef.

           Note: Only strong dependencies (Pre-Depends and Depends) are
           considered.

           Note: Self-dependencies (if any) are not included in the result.

       spelling_exceptions
           Returns a hashref of words, which the spell checker should ignore.
           These words are generally based on the package names in the group
           to avoid false-positive "spelling error" when packages have "fun"
           names.

           Example: Package alot-doc (#687464)
