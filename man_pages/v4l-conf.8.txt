NAME

v4l-conf -
configure a video4linux driver

SYNOPSIS

v4l-conf [
options ]

DESCRIPTION

v4l-conf
is a small helper tool. It figures out the video mode and
framebuffer base address of the graphics board and
configures a video4linux driver like bttv. This is needed
for drivers which can DMA the video over PCI directly into
the video memory.

Usually it is
not required to use v4l-conf manually, xawtv(1) and fbtv(1)
run it automatically at startup. It might be useful for
trouble-shooting. v4l-conf must be installed
suid-root.

v4l-conf
knows three ways to get the information:

*

Query the X-Server using the XF86 DGA extension. This is
the default if the DISPLAY environment variable is set.

*

Query the framebuffer driver. This is the default if
DISPLAY is not set.

*

Query the console driver. This is used on mklinux
only. 

OPTIONS

-h

Print a short description of all
command line options.

-q

Be quiet.

-d dpy

Use the X11 display dpy
to get the parameters.

-f

Use the framebuffer driver to get the parameters.

-c device

Set the video4linux device.

-b n

enforce n bpp color
depth. Works for switching between 15/16 and 24/32 bpp.

-s n

Shift the video display by
n bytes.

-a adr

Set framebuffer address to
adr. The value should be specified in hex. This
option is allowed for root only. You can&rsquo;t overwrite
the autodetected value, this switch is only useful if
autodetect doesn&rsquo;t work because the X-Server lacks DGA
support. You can put this into /etc/conf.modules, as
"post-install bttv ..." for example.

-p pitch

Set framebuffer pitch to
pitch bytes. The value should be specified in
decimal. Allowed for root only.

BUGS

Hope I
haven&rsquo;t any security flaws in there. If you find one,
drop me a note. Mails with patches are preferred :-)
