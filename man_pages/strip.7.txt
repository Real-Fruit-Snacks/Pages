NAME

strip &minus;
Strip query answers for other clients

DESCRIPTION

One problem
with ctrlproxy&rsquo;s multi&minus;client support is the
fact that when one client does a query (such as a WHOIS),
all other clients get the answer. This module fixes that
problem.

The following
queries are intercepted by this module:

&bull;

WHOIS

&bull;

WHO

&bull;

NAMES

&bull;

LIST

&bull;

TOPIC

&bull;

WHOWAS

&bull;

STATS

&bull;

VERSION

&bull;

LINKS

&bull;

TIME

&bull;

SUMMON

&bull;

USERS

&bull;

USERHOST

&bull;

ISON

VERSION

This man page
is valid for version 0.1 of the plugin.
