I4BING(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual I4BING(4)

NAME

i4bing &mdash; isdn4bsd
NetGraph ISDN B-channel interface driver

SYNOPSIS

device
"i4bing" [count]

DESCRIPTION

The i4bing driver
interfaces the FreeBSD NetGraph subsystem with the isdn4bsd
package.

The driver just
packs packets received from the NetGraph subsystem without
anything appended or prepended into raw HDLC packets on the
B channel and transfers them to a remote site. Packets
received from the remote site are queued into the NetGraph
subsystem.

In the case
where a packet for a remote site arrives in the driver and
no connection has been established yet, the driver
communicates with the isdnd(8) daemon to establish a
connection.
