GH-EXTENSION-SEARCH(1)         GitHub CLI manual        GH-EXTENSION-SEARCH(1)

NAME
       gh-extension-search - Search extensions to the GitHub CLI

SYNOPSIS
       gh extension search [<query>] [flags]

DESCRIPTION
       Search for gh extensions.

       With  no  arguments,  this  command  prints out the first 30 extensions
       available to install sorted by number of stars. More extensions can  be
       fetched by specifying a higher limit with the --limit flag.

       When  connected  to  a terminal, this command prints out three columns.
       The first has a ✓ if the extension is already  installed  locally.  The
       second  is the full name of the extension repository in NAME/OWNER for‐
       mat. The third is the extension's description.

       When not connected to a terminal, the ✓ character is  rendered  as  the
       word  "installed" but otherwise the order and content of the columns is
       the same.

       This command behaves similarly to 'gh search repos' but does  not  sup‐
       port  as  many  search qualifiers. For a finer grained search of exten‐
       sions, try using:

              gh search repos --topic "gh-extension"

       and adding qualifiers as needed. See 'gh help search  repos'  to  learn
       more about repository search.

       For  listing  just  the  extensions that are already installed locally,
       see:

              gh ext list
