NAME
       sane-snapscan - SANE backend for AGFA SnapScan flatbed scanners

DESCRIPTION
       The  sane-snapscan  library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy)
       backend that provides access to  AGFA  SnapScan  flatbed  scanners.  At
       present,  the  following scanners are supported from this backend: AGFA
       SnapScan 300, 310, 600, and 1236s, 1236u, 1212u, e20,  e25,  e40,  e50,
       e60,  Vuego  310s,  Acer  300f,  310s, 610s, 610plus, Prisa 620s, Prisa
       620u, Prisa 620ut, Prisa 640u, Prisa 640bu,  Prisa  1240,  Prisa  3300,
       Prisa  4300,  Prisa 5300 and Guillemot Maxi Scan A4 Deluxe (SCSI) (with
       varying success).

DEVICE NAMES
       This backend expects device names of the form:

              special

       Where special is the path-name for the special device that  corresponds
       to a SCSI scanner. For SCSI scanners, the special device name must be a
       generic SCSI device or a symlink to such a device.  Under Linux, such a
       device   name   could  be  /dev/sga  or  /dev/sge,  for  example.   See
       sane-scsi(5) for details.

       For USB scanners the devicename must contain the keyword "usb",  as  in
       /dev/usbscanner   or  /dev/usb/scanner0.   For  scanners  that  need  a
       firmware upload before scanning add a  line  starting  with  "firmware"
       followed by the fully qualified path to your firmware file, e.g.

              firmware /usr/share/sane/snapscan/firmware.bin

       For further details read http://snapscan.sourceforge.net.

CONFIGURATION
       The  contents  of the snapscan.conf file is a list of device names that
       correspond to SnapScan scanners.  Empty lines and lines starting with a
       hash mark (#) are ignored.  See sane-scsi(5) on details of what consti‐
       tutes a valid device name.

FILES
       /etc/sane.d/snapscan.conf
              The  backend  configuration  file  (see  also   description   of
              SANE_CONFIG_DIR below).

       /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-snapscan.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-snapscan.so
              The shared library implementing this backend (present on systems
              that support dynamic loading).

ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_CONFIG_DIR
              This environment variable specifies the list of directories that
              may contain the configuration file.  On *NIX systems, the direc‐
              tories are separated by a colon (`:'), under OS/2, they are sep‐
              arated  by a semi-colon (`;').  If this variable is not set, the
              configuration file  is  searched  in  two  default  directories:
              first,   the   current  working  directory  (".")  and  then  in
              /etc/sane.d.  If the value of the environment variable ends with
              the  directory separator character, then the default directories
              are searched after the explicitly  specified  directories.   For
              example,  setting SANE_CONFIG_DIR to "/tmp/config:" would result
              in directories tmp/config, ., and /etc/sane.d being searched (in
              this order).

       SANE_DEBUG_SNAPSCAN
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this en‐
              vironment variable controls the debug level  for  this  backend.
              E.g.,  a  value  of 255 requests all debug output to be printed.
              Smaller levels reduce verbosity.

BUGS
