DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of the samba(7) suite.

samba is the
server daemon that provides Active Directory, filesharing
and printing services to clients. The server provides
filespace and directory services to clients using the SMB
(or CIFS) protocol and other related protocols such as
DCE/RPC, LDAP and Kerberos.

Clients
supported include MSCLIENT 3.0 for DOS, Windows for
Workgroups, Windows 95/98/ME, Windows NT, Windows
2000/XP/2003, OS/2, DAVE for Macintosh, and cifsfs for
Linux.

An extensive
description of the services that the server can provide is
given in the man page for the configuration file controlling
the attributes of those services (see smb.conf(5).
This man page will not describe the services, but will
concentrate on the administrative aspects of running the
server.

Please note
that there are significant security implications to running
this server, and the smb.conf(5) manual page should
be regarded as mandatory reading before proceeding with
installation.

OPTIONS

-D|--daemon

If specified, this parameter
causes the server to operate as a daemon. That is, it
detaches itself and runs in the background, fielding
requests on the appropriate ports. Operating the server as a
daemon is the recommended way of running samba for servers
that provide more than casual use file and print services.
This switch is assumed if samba is executed on the command
line of a shell.

-F|--foreground

If specified, this parameter
causes the samba process to not daemonize, i.e. double-fork
and disassociate with the terminal.

-i|--interactive

If this parameter is specified
it causes the server to run "interactively", not
as a daemon, even if the server is executed on the command
line of a shell. Setting this parameter negates the implicit
daemon mode when run from the command line. samba also logs
to standard output, as if the -S parameter had been
given.

-M|--model

This parameter can be used to
specify the "process model" samba should use. This
determines how concurrent clients are handled. Available
process models include:

•
single

All Samba
services run in a single process. This is not recommended
for production configurations.

•
standard

A process is
created for each Samba service, and for those services that
support it (currently only LDAP and NETLOGON) a new
processes is started for each new client connection.

Historically,
this was the 'standard' way Samba behaved up until v4.10.
Note that this model can be resource intensive if you have a
large number of client connections.

•
prefork

The default. A
process is started for each Samba service, and a fixed
number of worker processes are started for those services
that support it (currently LDAP, NETLOGON, and KDC). The
client connections are then shared amongst the worker
processes. Requests for services not supporting prefork are
handled by a single process for that service.

The number of
prefork worker processes started is controlled by the
smb.conf(5) parameter
prefork
children, which defaults to
4.

--maximum-runtime=seconds

Set
maximum runtime of the server process till autotermination
in seconds.

-b|--show-build

Print
information about how Samba was built.

-d|--debuglevel=DEBUGLEVEL,
--debug-stdout

level
is an integer from 0 to 10. The default value if this
parameter is not specified is 0.

The
higher this value, the more detail will be logged to the log
files about the activities of the server. At level 0, only
critical errors and serious warnings will be logged. Level 1
is a reasonable level for day-to-day running - it generates
a small amount of information about operations carried
out.

Levels
above 1 will generate considerable amounts of log data, and
should only be used when investigating a problem. Levels
above 3 are designed for use only by developers and generate
HUGE amounts of log data, most of which is extremely
cryptic.

Note
that specifying this parameter here will override the
log level
parameter in the /etc/samba/smb.conf
file. This will redirect debug output to STDOUT. By default
server daemons are logging to a log file.

--configfile=CONFIGFILE

The file
specified contains the configuration details required by the
server. The information in this file includes
server-specific information such as what printcap file to
use, as well as descriptions of all the services that the
server is to provide. See /etc/samba/smb.conf for more
information. The default configuration file name is
determined at compile time.

--option==

Set the
smb.conf(5) option "" to value
"" from the command line. This
overrides compiled-in defaults and options read from the
configuration file. If a name or a value includes a space,
wrap whole --option=name=value into quotes.

-l|--log-basename=logdirectory

Base
directory name for log/debug files. The extension
".progname" will be appended (e.g.
log.smbclient, log.smbd, etc...). The log file is never
removed by the client.

--leak-report

Enable
talloc leak reporting on exit.

--leak-report-full

Enable
full talloc leak reporting on exit.

-V|--version

Prints
the program version number.

-?|--help

Print a
summary of command line options.

--usage

Display
brief usage message.

FILES

/etc/rc

or
whatever initialization script your system uses.

If
running the server as a daemon at startup, this file will
need to contain an appropriate startup sequence for the
server.

/etc/services

If
running the server via the meta-daemon inetd, this file must
contain a mapping of service name (e.g., netbios-ssn) to
service port (e.g., 139) and protocol type (e.g.,
tcp).

/usr/local/samba/lib/smb.conf

This is
the default location of the smb.conf(5) server
configuration file. Other common places that systems install
this file are /usr/samba/lib/smb.conf and
/etc/samba/smb.conf.

This
file describes all the services the server is to make
available to clients. See smb.conf(5) for more
information.

DIAGNOSTICS

Most
diagnostics issued by the server are logged in a specified
log file. The log file name is specified at compile time,
but may be overridden on the command line.

The
number and nature of diagnostics available depends on the
debug level used by the server. If you have problems, set
the debug level to 3 and peruse the log files.

Most
messages are reasonably self-explanatory. Unfortunately, at
the time this man page was created, there are too many
diagnostics available in the source code to warrant
describing each and every diagnostic. At this stage your
best bet is still to grep the source code and inspect the
conditions that gave rise to the diagnostics you are
seeing.

VERSION

This
man page is part of version 4.20.2-Debian-4.20.2+dfsg-10 of
the Samba suite.
