NAME

sq network dane
fetch - Retrieve certificates using DANE

SYNOPSIS

sq network
dane fetch [OPTIONS] ADDRESS

DESCRIPTION

Retrieve
certificates using DANE.

By default, any
returned certificates are stored in the local certificate
store. This can be overridden by using
&rsquo;--output&rsquo; option.

When a
certificate is retrieved using DANE, and imported into the
local certificate store, any User IDs with the email address
that was looked up are certificated with a local
DANE-specific key. That proxy certificate is in turn
certified as a minimally trusted CA (trust amount: 1 of 120)
by the local trust root. How much the DANE proxy CA is
trusted can be tuned using &rsquo;sq pki link add&rsquo; or
&rsquo;sq pki link retract&rsquo; in the usual way.
