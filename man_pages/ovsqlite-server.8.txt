NAME

ovsqlite-server
- Sole owner of the ovsqlite database

SYNOPSIS

ovsqlite-server
[-d]

DESCRIPTION

The
ovsqlite-server daemon is the only program that opens
the overview SQLite database. It accepts connections from
the other parts of INN that want to operate on overview data
(innd, nnrpd, expireover,
makehistory).

This daemon
must therefore be started before any other process can
access the overview database. ovsqlite-server is
normally invoked automatically by rc.news when
starting the news system. It is also stopped automatically
by rc.news when stopping the news system.

In case you
need to talk to this daemon from Perl, the binary protocol
used to communicate with it has been implemented in the
"INN::ovsqlite_client" Perl module. See its manual
page for more information about its possibilities.

OPTIONS

-d

ovsqlite-server normally
puts itself into the background, points its standard output
and error to log files, and disassociates itself from the
terminal. Using -d prevents all of this, resulting in
log messages being written to the standard error output;
this is generally useful only for debugging.

FILES

pathetc/ovsqlite.conf

The configuration file. See
ovsqlite(5).

pathoverview/ovsqlite.db

The SQLite database file.

pathrun/ovsqlite.pid

Stores the PID of the server
process while it&rsquo;s running.

pathrun/ovsqlite.sock

When Unix-domain sockets are
available, the server binds its listening socket to this
path.

pathrun/ovsqlite.port

When Unix-domain sockets
aren&rsquo;t available, the server binds its
listening socket to a dynamic TCP port on the IPv4 loopback
interface and stores the port number in this file.
