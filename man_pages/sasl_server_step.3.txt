DESCRIPTION

int
sasl_server_step(sasl_conn_t *conn, 
const char *clientin, 
unsigned clientinlen, 
const char ** serverout, 
unsigned * serveroutlen);

sasl_server_step()
performs a step in the authentication negotiation. It
returns SASL_OK if the whole negotiation is
successful and SASL_CONTINUE if this step is ok but
at least one more step is needed. 
Parameters

&bull;

conn &ndash; is the SASL connection context

&bull;

clientin &ndash; is the data given by the client
(decoded if the protocol encodes requests sent over the
wire) 

&bull;

clientinlen &ndash; is the length of
clientin 

&bull;

serverout &ndash; set by the library and should
be sent to the client.

&bull;

serveroutlen &ndash; length of
serverout. 

RETURN VALUE

SASL callback
functions should return SASL return codes. See sasl.h for a
complete list. SASL_CONTINUE indicates success and
that there are more steps needed in the authentication.
SASL_OK indicates that the authentication is
complete.

Other return
codes indicate errors and should either be handled or the
authentication session should be quit.
