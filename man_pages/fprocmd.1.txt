NAME

fprocmd, fpro
&minus; get or set permissions for directories in the FSP
database

SYNOPSIS

fprocmd
[ +c|-c|+d|-d|+g|-g|+m|-m|+l|-l|+r|-r ] [
directory ] ...

fpro [
+c|-c|+d|-d|+g|-g|+m|-m|+l|-l|+r|-r ] [ directory
] ...

DESCRIPTION

If no flags are
specified, for each file named in the argument list,
fprocmd displays the current permission settings for
each directory named. If a flag is present (only one may be
specified each time), fprocmd will perform the
following operations and display the resulting settings for
each named directory:

+c

Give others permission to create new items.

-c

Deny others permission to create new items.

+d

Give others permission to delete old items.

-d

Deny others permission to delete old items.

+g

Give others permission to get items.

-g

Deny others permission to get items.

+m

Give others permission to create subdirectories.

-m

Deny others permission to create subdirectories.

+l

Give others permission to list directory content.

-l

Deny others permission to list directory content.

+r

Give others permission to rename files in this
directory. 

-r

Deny others permission to rename files in this
directory. 

fprocmd
will perform csh file name globbing based on file and
directory information obtained from the FSP database.

Since
user&rsquo;s command shells generally cannot do the proper
globbing for this program, it is recommended that user
defines a shell alias or function to turn off command shell
globbing before running this program. csh
example:

alias fpro
\(set noglob\; exec fprocmd \!\*\)

ENVIRONMENT
