NAME

ispcvt &mdash; verify if
current video driver is pcvt driver

SYNOPSIS

ispcvt [&minus;c]
[&minus;d device] [&minus;n]
[&minus;v]

DESCRIPTION

The ispcvt utility allows
the user to check whether the current video driver compiled
into the kernel is a pcvt driver. The major and minor
release numbers of the driver are also checked. Furthermore
ispcvt is also able to print out the values of all
the &rsquo;&rsquo;PCVT_XXXXXX&rsquo;&rsquo; compile
time options, the driver in the current running kernel was
compiled with.

The options are
as follows:

&minus;d

Specifies a
device for which the check is done.

&minus;v

Specifies being
verbose. On success the name and revision is reported, on
failure which comparison failed.

&minus;n

print the
number of compiled-in virtual terminals.

&minus;c

This options
prints out the values of all
&rsquo;&rsquo;PCVT_XXXXXX&rsquo;&rsquo; #defines
which were given to the compiler at the time the currently
running kernel was compiled. Specifying &minus;v with
the &minus;c option gives a verbose listing of the
compile-time options.

DIAGNOSTICS

The ispcvt utility exits
with one of the following values:

0

driver is pcvt
and major and minor numbers match

1

open(2) or
ioctl(2) system call failed

2

driver name
mismatch

3

name matched,
release major number mismatch

4

name and major
number matched, release minor number mismatch

5
