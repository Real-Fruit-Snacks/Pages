DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

pamaddnoise
adds the specified noise type to a Netpbm image.
pamaddnoise treats a PPM image as 3 independent
planes, not as a plane of colors in a color space.

OPTIONS

In addition to
the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most
notably -quiet, see
 Common Options ),
pamaddnoise recognizes the following command line
options: 
-type noise_type

Select type of noise by name.
The following noise types are available: gaussian,
multiplicative_gaussian, impulse, laplacian, poisson. Only
enough letters to be unique are required for the noise type
option. The default noise type is gaussian.

gaussian

To each sample
value is added the value of a two Gaussian random variables.

The variance of one is independent of the sample value,
while the variance 
of the other is proportional to the sample value. You
control these 
variances with options -sigma1 and -sigma2
(and can eliminate 
either by setting the variance to 0). The mean of the
Gaussian 
distributions is 0.

multiplicative_gaussian 
impulse

This is
’salt and pepper’ noise. Samples are changed
randomly 
to zero or full brightness or left alone. This is also know
as salt and 
pepper noise, as in a grayscale picture, it adds white
pixels and black 
pixels, which look like salt and pepper, respectively.
Control this with 
options -tolerance and -salt.

laplacian 
poisson 
-lambda value

This is valid only with
-type=poisson. It is the expected value of the
Poisson distribution for a sample value of maximum
intensity. The expected value for other intensities is
proportional; e.g. for half intensity, it is half this
value.

The default
value is 12.

-lsigma value

This is meaningful only for
laplacian noise.

The default
value is 10.0.

-mgsigma
value

This is valid only for
multiplicative gaussian noise.

The default
value is 0.5.

-seed int

This is the random number
generator seed value. Use this to get 
repeatable results.

-sigma1 value

This is valid only for gaussian
noise. It is the standard deviation 
of the Gaussian random variable that is multiplied by the
square root of 
each sample value and added to that sample value.

The default
value is 4.0.

-sigma2 value

This is valid only for gaussian
noise. 
It is the standard deviation of the Gaussian random variable
that is 
added directly to each sample value.

The default
value is 20.0.

-tolerance
fraction

This is valid only for impulse
noise. 
fraction is the fraction of samples that are changed

in the output. Whether each is changed to salt or pepper is
controlled by 
-salt.

The default
value is 0.10.

-salt=fraction

This is valid
only for impulse noise. fraction is the 
fraction of the pixels that are changed that are changed to
salt (maxval); 
the rest are changed to pepper (0).

The default is
0.5 (half salt, half pepper).

This option was
new in Netpbm 11.04 (September 2023). Before that, the 
noise is always half salt and half pepper.

HISTORY

pamaddnoise
was added to Netpbm in Version 10.29 (August 2005). It had
been distributed by Mike Burns via his own web site before
that (and continued to be so).

Burns’
version, and the one in Netpbm 10.29, was called
pnmaddnoise and worked only on PNM images. In Netpbm
10.30, it was converted to handle PAM images and renamed to
pamaddnoise.
