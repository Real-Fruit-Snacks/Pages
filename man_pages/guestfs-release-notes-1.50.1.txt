RELEASE NOTES FOR LIBGUESTFS 1.50

These are the
release notes for libguestfs stable release 1.50. This
describes the major changes since 1.48.

Libguestfs
1.50.0 was released on 7 February 2023.

Language
bindings 
Fix the PHP bindings for PHP8 (Geoff Amey).

Fix various
deprecation warnings in the GObject bindings.

We no longer
use the deprecated Python distutils library (thanks Miro
Hrončok).

Inspection

When listing the packages in RPM-based guests, the
inspection API no longer checks package signatures. This is
because the newer librpm used by libguestfs does not
understand signatures stored in older guests, such as SHA1
used by RHEL 6 (thanks Panu Matilainen).

"guestfs_inspect_get_hostname"
in guestfs(3) can now handle /etc/hostname
files containing comments (thanks Dawid Zamirski).

"guestfs_file_architecture"
in guestfs(3) can now parse files using zstd
compression.

"guestfs_inspect_get_osinfo"
in guestfs(3) now returns the correct osinfo field
for Windows 11. However because of decisions made by
Microsoft, these guests still return product name and other
strings identifying as Windows 10 (thanks Yaakov Selkowitz,
Yongkui Guo).

API

New APIs

"guestfs_device_name"
in guestfs(3) is a new API to read the device name
associated with a drive, for example calling this with 0
will return "/dev/sda".

"guestfs_clevis_luks_unlock"
in guestfs(3) is a new API for unlocking disks using
the Clevis/Tang network-based full disk encryption scheme.
Furthermore implement this in guestfish and guestmount
(Laszlo Ersek).

"guestfs_inspect_get_build_id"
in guestfs(3) is a new API for reading the build ID
from some Linux and Windows guests. It is not widely used on
Linux, but for Windows it is vital for identifying Windows
11.

Other API
changes

In the
"guestfs_add_drive" in guestfs(3) API, the
"name" and "iface" fields are not used.
"name" has not been used since around 2017, but
the documentation has only just been updated to reflect
this. "iface" was never allowed for the libvirt
backend and didn’t work reliably with the direct
backend (Laszlo Ersek).

"guestfs_readdir"
in guestfs(3) is no longer limited to the maximum
message size but can read a directory of any size (Laszlo
Ersek).

Build
changes 
Note that the Augeas bindings for libguestfs are no
longer bundled with libguestfs and must be built separately.
See: https://people.redhat.com/~rjones/augeas/ For RHEL 7+
rebuilding the Fedora Rawhide package will work.

Note
that libguestfs now requires minimum OCaml 4.04. It will not
compile on RHEL 6.

Note
that zstd is now a required dependency.

OCaml gettext
is no longer a dependency of libguestfs. (Plain gettext is
still optionally used to translate C source files.)

Add support for
OCaml 4.14.

Fix build for
missing stdlib functions in OCaml 4.04.

Fix
"./configure --disable-ocaml". OCaml is still
required to build libguestfs, but this now correctly
disables the OCaml bindings of the API.

Add support for
building on Artix, Rocky and Virtuozzo (Halil Tezcan
KARABULUT, Neil Hanlon, Andrey Drobyshev). In addition when
working out the local distro we now look at $ID_LIKE in
/etc/os-release before $ID which helps on Arch
(thanks S D Rausty).

Add preliminary
support for compiling libguestfs on macOS.

Fix website
description of cloning the libguestfs repository (Kashyap
Chamarthy).

We no longer
use glibc custom printf.

We no longer
use "LD_PRELOAD=libSegFault.so" in the appliance.
This feature was removed in glibc 2.35.

We no longer
use dtrace / systemtap probes.

Internals

Fix regression tests to use correct paths (Nikolay
Shirokovskiy).

Various
improvements to qcow2 appliance handling (Andrey
Drobyshev).

Disable 5-level
page tables in qemu. This avoids a bug in older versions of
qemu.

Disable the
LVM2 devicesfile in the appliance since it interferes with
cloned LVs that have the same UUID (Laszlo Ersek).

Don’t use
"-cpu max" on RISC-V as it is not yet supported by
qemu’s TCG emulation of that architecture. This will
be reenabled when qemu gets support.

Avoid a rare
hang that would happen when launching the appliance. This
turned out to be caused by using the unsafe call
setenv(3) between fork and exec (thanks Siddhesh
Poyarekar).

When running
the file command inside the appliance we now disable seccomp
since it interferes with processing compressed files (thanks
David Runge, Toolybird).
