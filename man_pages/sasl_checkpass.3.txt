sasl_checkpass
- Cyrus SASL documentation

SYNOPSIS

#include

int
sasl_checkpass(sasl_conn_t *conn, 
const char *user, 
unsigned userlen, 
const char *pass, 
unsigned passlen);

DESCRIPTION

int
sasl_checkpass(sasl_conn_t *conn, 
const char *user, 
unsigned userlen, 
const char *pass, 
unsigned passlen)

sasl_checkpass will
check a plaintext password. This is needed for protocols
that had a login method before SASL (for example the LOGIN
command in IMAP). The password is checked with the
pwcheck_method. See sasl_callbacks(3) for information
on how this parameter is set.

RETURN VALUE

sasl_checkpass
returns an integer which corresponds to one of the following
codes. SASL_OK indicates that the authentication is
complete. All other return codes indicate errors and should
either be handled or the authentication session should be
quit. See sasl_errors(3) for meanings of return
codes.
