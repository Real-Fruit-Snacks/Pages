DESCRIPTION

evdev is
an Xorg input driver for Linux´s generic event
devices. It therefore supports all input devices that the
kernel knows about, including most mice, keyboards, tablets
and touchscreens. evdev is the default driver on the
major Linux distributions.

The
evdev driver can serve as both a pointer and a
keyboard input device. Multiple input devices are supported
by multiple instances of this driver, with one InputDevice
section of your xorg.conf for each input device that will
use this driver.

It is
recommended that evdev devices are configured through
the InputClass directive (refer to xorg.conf(5))
instead of manual per-device configuration. Devices
configured in the xorg.conf(5) are not hot-plug capable.

SUPPORTED HARDWARE

In general, any
input device that the kernel has a driver for can be
accessed through the evdev driver. See the Linux
kernel documentation for a complete list.

CONFIGURATION DETAILS

Please refer to
xorg.conf(5) for general configuration details and for
options that can be used with all input drivers. This
section only covers configuration details specific to this
driver.

The following
driver Options are supported: 
Option "ButtonMapping"
"string"

Sets the button mapping for
this device. The mapping is a space-separated list of button
mappings that correspond in order to the physical buttons on
the device (i.e. the first number is the mapping for button
1, etc.). The default mapping is "1 2 3 ... 32". A
mapping of 0 deactivates the button. Multiple buttons can
have the same mapping. For example, a left-handed mouse with
deactivated scroll-wheel would use a mapping of "3 2 1
0 0". Invalid mappings are ignored and the default
mapping is used. Buttons not specified in the user’s
mapping use the default mapping.

Option "Device"
"string"

Specifies the device through
which the device can be accessed. This will generally be of
the form "/dev/input/eventX", where X is some
integer. The mapping from device node to hardware is
system-dependent. Property: "Device Node"
(read-only).

Option
"DragLockButtons" "L1 B2 L3
B4"

Sets "drag lock
buttons" that simulate holding a button down, so that
low dexterity people do not have to hold a button down at
the same time they move a mouse cursor. Button numbers occur
in pairs, with the lock button number occurring first,
followed by the button number that is the target of the lock
button. Property: "Evdev Drag Lock Buttons".

Option
"DragLockButtons"
"M1"

Sets a "master drag lock
button" that acts as a "Meta Key" indicating
that the next button pressed is to be "drag
locked". Property: "Evdev Drag Lock
Buttons".

Option
"Emulate3Buttons"
"boolean"

Enable/disable the emulation of
the third (middle) mouse button for mice which only have two
physical buttons. The third button is emulated by pressing
both buttons simultaneously. Default: off. Property:
"Evdev Middle Button Emulation".

Option
"Emulate3Timeout"
"integer"

Sets the timeout (in
milliseconds) that the driver waits before deciding if two
buttons where pressed "simultaneously" when 3
button emulation is enabled. Default: 50. Property:
"Evdev Middle Button Timeout".

Option
"Emulate3Button"
"integer"

Specifies the physical button
number to be emitted if middle button emulation is
triggered. Default: 2. Property: "Evdev Middle Button
Button".

Option
"EmulateWheel"
"boolean"

Enable/disable
"wheel" emulation. Wheel emulation means emulating
button press/release events when the mouse is moved while a
specific real button is pressed. Wheel button events
(typically buttons 4 and 5) are usually used for scrolling.
Wheel emulation is useful for getting wheel-like behaviour
with trackballs. It can also be useful for mice with 4 or
more buttons but no wheel. See the description of the
EmulateWheelButton, EmulateWheelInertia,
EmulateWheelTimeout, XAxisMapping, and
YAxisMapping options. Default: off. Property
"Evdev Wheel Emulation".

Option
"EmulateWheelButton"
"integer"

Specifies which button must be
held down to enable wheel emulation mode. While this button
is down, X and/or Y pointer movement will generate button
press/release events as specified for the
XAxisMapping and YAxisMapping settings. If the
button is 0 and EmulateWheel is on, any motion of the
device is converted into wheel events. Default: 4. Property:
"Evdev Wheel Emulation Button".

Option
"EmulateWheelInertia"
"integer"

Specifies how far (in pixels)
the pointer must move to generate button press/release
events in wheel emulation mode. Default: 10. Property:
"Evdev Wheel Emulation Inertia".

This value must
be set for any device does not resemble a standard mouse.
Specifically, on absolute devices such as tablets the value
should be set to a reasonable fraction of the expected
movement to avoid excess scroll events.

WARNING:
the name "inertia" is a misnomer. This option
defines the distance required to generate one scroll event
similar to the VertScrollDelta and
HorizScrollDelta options. It does not enable inertia
in the physical sense, scrolling stops immediately once the
movement has stopped.

Option
"EmulateWheelTimeout"
"integer"

Specifies the time in
milliseconds the EmulateWheelButton must be pressed
before wheel emulation is started. If the
EmulateWheelButton is released before this timeout,
the original button press/release event is sent. Default:
200. Property: "Evdev Wheel Emulation
Timeout".

Option
"EmulateThirdButton"
"boolean"

Enable third button emulation.
Third button emulation emits a right button event (by
default) by pressing and holding the first button. The first
button must be held down for the configured timeout and must
not move more than the configured threshold for the
emulation to activate. Otherwise, the first button event is
posted as normal. Default: off. Property: "Evdev Third
Button Emulation".

Option
"EmulateThirdButtonTimeout"
"integer"

Specifies the timeout in
milliseconds between the initial button press and the
generation of the emulated button event. Default: 1000.
Property: "Evdev Third Button Emulation
Timeout".

Option
"EmulateThirdButtonButton"
"integer"

Specifies the physical button
number to be emitted if third button emulation is triggered.
Default: 3. Property: "Evdev Third Button
Button".

Option
"EmulateThirdButtonMoveThreshold"
"integer"

Specifies the maximum move fuzz
in device coordinates for third button emulation. If the
device moves by more than this threshold before the third
button emulation is triggered, the emulation is cancelled
and a first button event is generated as normal. Default:
20. Property: "Evdev Third Button Emulation
Threshold".

Option
"GrabDevice"
"boolean"

Force a grab on the event
device. Doing so will ensure that no other driver can
initialise the same device and it will also stop the device
from sending events to /dev/kbd or /dev/input/mice. Events
from this device will not be sent to virtual devices (e.g.
rfkill or the Macintosh mouse button emulation). Default:
disabled.

Option "InvertX"
"Bool" 
Option "InvertY"
"Bool"

Invert the given axis. Default:
off. Property: "Evdev Axis Inversion".

Option
"IgnoreRelativeAxes"
"Bool" 
Option "IgnoreAbsoluteAxes"
"Bool"

Ignore the specified type of
axis. Default: unset. The X server cannot deal with devices
that have both relative and absolute axes. Evdev tries to
guess wich axes to ignore given the device type and disables
absolute axes for mice and relative axes for tablets,
touchscreens and touchpad. These options allow to forcibly
disable an axis type. Mouse wheel axes are exempt and will
work even if relative axes are ignored. No property, this
configuration must be set in the configuration. 
If either option is set to False, the driver will not ignore
the specified axes regardless of the presence of other axes.
This may trigger buggy behavior and events from this axis
are always forwarded. Users are discouraged from setting
this option.

Option
"Calibration" "min-x max-x min-y
max-y"

Calibrates the X and Y axes for
devices that need to scale to a different coordinate system
than reported to the X server. This feature is required for
devices that need to scale to a different coordinate system
than originally reported by the kernel (e.g. touchscreens).
The scaling to the custom coordinate system is done
in-driver and the X server is unaware of the transformation.
Property: "Evdev Axis Calibration".

Option "Mode"
"Relative"|"Absolute"

Sets the mode of the device if
device has absolute axes. The default value for touchpads is
relative, for other absolute. This option has no effect on
devices without absolute axes.

Option "SwapAxes"
"Bool"

Swap x/y axes. Default: off.
Property: "Evdev Axes Swap".

Option
"XAxisMapping" "N1
N2"

Specifies which buttons are
mapped to motion in the X direction in wheel emulation mode.
Button number N1 is mapped to the negative X axis
motion and button number N2 is mapped to the positive
X axis motion. Default: no mapping. Property: "Evdev
Wheel Emulation Axes".

Option
"YAxisMapping" "N1
N2"

Specifies which buttons are
mapped to motion in the Y direction in wheel emulation mode.
Button number N1 is mapped to the negative Y axis
motion and button number N2 is mapped to the positive
Y axis motion. Default: "4 5". Property:
"Evdev Wheel Emulation Axes".

Option "TypeName"
"type""

Specify the X Input 1.x type
(see XListInputDevices(3)). There is rarely a need to use
this option, evdev will guess the device type based on the
device’s capabilities. This option is provided for
devices that need quirks.

Option
"VertScrollDelta"
"integer"

The amount of motion considered
one unit of scrolling vertically. Default: "1".
Property: "Evdev Scrolling Distance".

Option
"HorizScrollDelta"
"integer"

The amount of motion considered
one unit of scrolling horizontally. Default: "1".
Property: "Evdev Scrolling Distance".

Option "DialDelta"
"integer"

The amount of motion considered
one unit of turning the dial. Default: "1".
Property: "Evdev Scrolling Distance".

Option
"Resolution"
"integer"

Sets the resolution of the
device in dots per inch. The resolution is used to scale
relative motion events from mouse devices to 1000 DPI
resolution. This can be used to make high resolution mice
less sensitive without turning off acceleration. If set to 0
no scaling will be performed. Default: "0".
