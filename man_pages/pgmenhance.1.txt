NAME

pgmenhance -
edge-enhance a PGM image

SYNOPSIS

pgmenhance

[-N]

[pgmfile]

DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

pgmenhance
reads a PGM image as input, enhances the edges, and writes a
PGM image as output.

The edge
enhancing technique is taken from Philip R. Thompson’s
"xim" program, which in turn took it from section
6 of "Digital Halftones by Dot Diffusion", D. E.
Knuth, ACM Transaction on Graphics Vol. 6, No. 4, October
1987, which in turn got it from two 1976 papers by J. F.
Jarvis et. al.

OPTIONS

In addition to
the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most
notably -quiet, see
 Common Options ),
pgmenhance recognizes the following command line
option:

-N

The optional -N option should be a digit
from 1 to 9. 1 is the lowest level of enhancement; 9 is the
highest. The default is 9.
