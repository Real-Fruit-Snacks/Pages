NAME

fns_initial_context
&minus; overview of the FNS Initial Context

DESCRIPTION

Every
FNS name is interpreted relative to some context, and
every FNS naming operation is performed on a context
object. The FNS programming interface (XFN) provides
a function that allows the client to obtain an Initial
Context object. The Initial Context provides the initial
pathway to other FNS contexts. FNS defines a
set of bindings that the client can expect to find in this
context,

FNS
assumes that for every process:

1.

There is a user associated with the process when
fn_ctx_handle_from_initial() is invoked. This
association is based on the effective uid of the process. In
the following discussion this user is denoted by U.
The association of user to process may change during the
life of a process but does not affect the context handle
originally returned by
fn_ctx_handle_from_initial(). 

2.

The process is running on a host when
fn_ctx_handle_from_initial() is invoked. In the
following discussion this host is denoted by H.

The following
atomic names can appear in the Initial Context:

Except for
..., these names with an added underscore
(&rsquo;_&rsquo;) prefix are also in the Initial
Context and have the same binding as their counterpart (for
example, thishost and _thishost have the same
binding). In addition, org has the same binding as
orgunit, and thisuser has the same binding as
myself. The bindings for these names are summarized
in the following table.

Some of these
names may not necessarily appear in all Initial Contexts.
For example, a process owned by the super-user of a machine
does not have any of the user-related bindings. Or, for
another example, an installation that has not set up a site
namespace will not have the site-related bindings.

...

global context for resolving DNS
or X.500 names. Synonym: /...

thishost

H&rsquo;s host context.
Synonym: _thishost

thisens

the enterprise root of
H. Synonym: _thisens

thisorgunit

H&rsquo;s distinguished
organizational unit context. In Solaris, this is
H&rsquo;s NIS+ home domain. Synonym:
_thisorgunit

myself

U&rsquo;s user context.
Synonyms: _myself, thisuser

myens

the enterprise root of U. Synonym:
_myens 

myorgunit

U&rsquo;s distinguished
organizational unit context. In Solaris, this is
U&rsquo;s NIS+ home domain. Synonym:
_myorgunit

user

the context in which users in the same organizational
unit as H are named. Synonym: _user

host

the context in which hosts in the same organizational
unit as H are named. Synonym: _host

org

the root context of the organizational unit namespace in
H&rsquo;s enterprise. In Solaris, this corresponds to
the NIS+ root domain. Synonyms: orgunit,
_orgunit 

site

the root context of the site namespace in
H&rsquo;s enterprise, if the site namespace has been
configured. Synonym: _site

EXAMPLES

Example 1:
Names beginning with the enterprise root

The types of
objects that may be named relative to the enterprise root
are user, host, service, organizational unit, file, and
site. Here are some examples of names that begin with the
enterprise root: 
thisens/orgunit/multimedia.servers.engineering

names an organizational unit
multimedia.servers.engineering in H&rsquo;s
enterprise.

thisens/site/northwing.floor3.admin

names the north wing site, on
the third floor of the administrations building in
H&rsquo;s enterprise.

myens/user/hdiffie

names the user hdiffie
in U&rsquo;s enterprise.

myens/service/teletax

names the teletax
service of U&rsquo;s enterprise.

Example 2:
Names beginning with organizational unit names

The types of
objects that may be named relative to an organizational unit
name are: user, host, service, file, and site. Here are some
examples of names that begin with organizational unit names
(either explicitly via org, or implicitly via
thisorgunit or myorgunit), and name objects
relative to organizational unit names when resolved in the
Initial Context: 

org/accounts_payable.finance/site/videoconference.northwing

names a conference room
videoconference located in the north wing of the site
associated with the organizational unit
accounts_payable.finance.

org/finance/user/mjones

names a user mjones in
the organizational unit 
finance.

org/finance/host/inmail

names a machine inmail
belonging to the organizational unit finance.

org/accounts_payable.finance/fs/pub/blue-and-whites/FY92-124

names a file
pub/blue-and-whites/FY92-124 belonging to the
organizational unit accounts_payable.finance.

org/accounts_payable.finance/service/calendar

names the calendar
service of the organizational unit
accounts_payable.finance. This might manage the
meeting schedules of the organizational unit.

thisorgunit/user/cmead

names the user cmead in
H&rsquo;s organizational unit.

myorgunit/fs/pub/project_plans/widget.ps

names the file
pub/project_plans/widget.ps exported by
U&rsquo;s organizational unit&rsquo;s file
system.

Example 3:
Names beginning with site names

The types of
objects that may be named relative to a site name are users,
hosts, services, and files. Here are some examples of names
that begin with site names via site, and name objects
relative to sites when resolved in the Initial Context:

site/b5.mtv/service/printer/speedy

names a printer speedy
in the b5.mtv site.

site/admin/fs/usr/dist

names a file directory
usr/dist available in the site admin.

Example 4:
Names beginning with user names

The types of
objects that may be named relative to a user name are
services and files. Here are some examples of names that
begin with user names (explicitly via user or
implicitly via thisuser), and name objects relative
to users when resolved in the Initial Context: 
user/jsmith/service/calendar

names the 
calendar service of the user jsmith.

user/jsmith/fs/bin/games/riddles

names the file
bin/games/riddles of the user jsmith.

thisuser/service/printer

names the printer
service of U.

Example 5:
Names beginning with host names

The types of
objects that may be named relative to a host name are
services and files. Here are some examples of names that
begin with host names (explicitly via host or implicitly
via thishost), and name objects relative to hosts when
resolved in the Initial Context: 
host/mailhop/service/mailbox

names the 
mailbox service associated with the machine
mailhop.

host/mailhop/fs/pub/saf/archives.91

names the directory
pub/saf/archives.91 found under the root directory of
the machine mailhop.

thishost/service/printer

names the printer
service of H.
