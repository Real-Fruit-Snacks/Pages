FDREAD(1) BSD General Commands Manual FDREAD(1)

NAME

fdread &mdash; read
floppy disks

SYNOPSIS

fdread
[&minus;qr] [&minus;d device]
[&minus;f fillbyte]
[&minus;o file] 
fdread [&minus;d device]
&minus;I numsects
[&minus;t trackno]

DESCRIPTION

The fdread utility reads
floppy disks. Effective read blocking based on the track
size is performed, and floppy-specific error recovery of
otherwise bad blocks can be enabled.

The
fdread utility will always read an entire floppy
medium, and write its contents to the respective output
file. Unlike other tools like dd(1), fdread
automatically uses a read block size that is more efficient
than reading single blocks (usually one track of data at a
time), but falls back to reading single floppy sectors in
case of an input/output error occurred, in order to obtain
as much valid data as possible. While fdread is
working, kernel error reporting for floppy errors is turned
off, so the console and/or syslog are not flooded with
kernel error messages.

The
fdread utility accepts the following options:

&minus;q

Turn on quiet
mode. By default, the medium parameters of the device are
being written to standard error output, progress will be
indicated by the approximate number of kilobytes read so
far, and errors will be printed out in detail, including the
information about the location of recovered data in the
output. In quiet mode, none of these messages will be
generated.

&minus;r

Enable error
recovery. By default, fdread stops after the first
unrecovered read error, much like dd(1) does. In recovery
mode, however, one of two recovery actions will be
taken:

&bull;

If the error was a CRC error in
the data field, the kernel is told to ignore the error, and
data are transferred to the output file anyway. Note that
this will cause the erroneous data to be included in the
output file! Still, this is the best recovery action
that can be taken at all.

&bull;

All other errors are really
fatal (usually, the FDC didn&rsquo;t find the sector ID
fields), thus a dummy block with fill bytes will be included
in the output file.

Unless
operating in quiet mode, the action taken and the location
of the error in the output file will be displayed.

&minus;d
device

Specify the input floppy
device, defaulting to /dev/fd0. The parameter
device must be a valid floppy disk device.

&minus;f
fillbyte

Value of the fill byte used for
dummy blocks in the output file in recovery mode. Defaults
to &rsquo;0xf0&rsquo;. (Mnemonic:
&rsquo;&rsquo;foo&rsquo;&rsquo;.) The value can be specified
using the usual C language notation of the number base.

&minus;o file

Specify the output file to be
file. By default, the data will be written to
standard output.

&minus;I
numsects

Read numsects sector ID
fields, and write out their contents to standard output.
Each sector ID field contains recorded values for the
cylinder number (&rsquo;C&rsquo;), the head number
(&rsquo;H&rsquo;), the record number (sector number starting
with 1) (&rsquo;R&rsquo;), and the sector shift value
(0 = 128 bytes, 1 = 256 bytes, 2 = 512 bytes, 3 = 1024
bytes) (&rsquo;N&rsquo;). The &minus;I option is
mutually exclusive with all other options except
&minus;d device and &minus;t
trackno.

&minus;t
trackno

Specify the track number
(cylinder number * number of heads + head number) to read
the sector ID fields from; only allowed together with the
&minus;I numsects option.

FILES 
/dev/fd0

Default device
to read from.

DIAGNOSTICS

The fdread utility sets
the exit value according to sysexits(3). In recovery mode,
the exit value will be set to EX_IOERR if any error occurred
during processing (even in quiet mode).

Unless running
in quiet mode, upon encountering an error, the status of the
floppy disc controller (FDC) will be printed out, both in
hexadecimal form, followed by a textual description that
translates those values into a human-readable form for the
most common error cases that can happen in a PC
environment.

The FDC error
status includes the three FDC status registers
&rsquo;ST0&rsquo;, &rsquo;ST1&rsquo;, and &rsquo;ST2&rsquo;,
as well as the location of the error (physical cylinder,
head, and sector number, plus the &rsquo;&rsquo;sector shift
value&rsquo;&rsquo;, respectively). See the manual for the
NE765 or compatible for details about the status register
contents.

The FDC&rsquo;s
status is then examined to determine whether the error is
deemed to be recoverable. If error recovery was requested,
the location of the bad block in the output file is
indicated by its (hexadecimal) bounds. Also, a summary line
indicating the total number of transfer errors will be
printed before exiting.

HISTORY

The fdread utility was
written mainly to provide a means of recovering at least
some of the data on bad media, and to obviate the need to
invoke dd(1) with too many hard to memorize options that
might be useful to handle a floppy.

The command
appeared in FreeBSD 5.0.

BUGS

Concurrent traffic on the second
floppy drive located at the same FDC will make error
recovery attempts pointless, since the FDC status obtained
after a read error occurred cannot be guaranteed to actually
belong to the erroneous transfer. Thus using option
&minus;r is only reliable if device is the
only active drive on that controller.

No attempt
beyond the floppy error retry mechanism of fdc(4) is made in
order to see whether bad sectors could still be read without
errors by trying multiple times.

Bits that are
(no longer) available on the floppy medium cannot be guessed
by fdread.
