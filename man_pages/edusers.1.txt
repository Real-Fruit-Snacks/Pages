NAME

edusers - edit
users list created by package

SYNOPSIS

edusers
[system [version]]

DESCRIPTION

This command
lets you safely edit the users list created by the
package command. It locks the file before launching
the editor, hence protecting against any concurrent update
by some package command that could arrive at the same
time (by e-mail). The level of protection this locking buys
you depends on the locking policy you have configured in
your ~/.mailagent.

If you are
within a package source tree, all you need to say is
edusers

to edit the
users file for that package. In order for that
particular feature to work properly, the package must have
been placed under dist control, or at least the
packinit command from the dist package must have been
run.

Otherwise, you
may specify a system name, and optionally a version number
if that is not enough to disambiguate. Using &rsquo;-&rsquo;
will get you the lattest version available.

In any case,
there must be a proper setting of the distribs file
to use this command. If that file is not accurate, the
package command will not be able to produce a
users file anyway.

ENVIRONMENT

The editor is
taken out of the EDITOR variable if defined, then from the
VISUAL variable, defaulting to /usr/ae if none of the
variables is set.

FILES

~/.mailagent

mailagent.
