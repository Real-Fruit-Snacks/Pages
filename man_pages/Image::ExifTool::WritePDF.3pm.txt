Image::ExifTool::WriteUser3Contributed Perl DocuImage::ExifTool::WritePDF(3pm)

NAME
       Image::ExifTool::WritePDF.pl - Write PDF meta information

SYNOPSIS
       These routines are autoloaded by Image::ExifTool::PDF.

DESCRIPTION
       This file contains routines to write PDF metadata.

NOTES
       When writing a PDF, exiftool does not modify the existing data.
       Instead, the PDF file is appended with an incremental update which can
       easily be removed to revert the file (by using ExifTool to delete the
       special "PDF-update" pseudo group).
