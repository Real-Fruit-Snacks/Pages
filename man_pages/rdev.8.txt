NAME

rdev &minus;
query/set image root device, RAM disk size, or video
mode

SYNOPSIS

rdev
[&minus;Rrvh] [&minus;o offset]
[image [value [offset]]] 
rdev [&minus;o offset] [image
[root_device [offset]]] 
ramsize [&minus;o offset] [image
[size [offset]]] 
vidmode [&minus;o offset] [image
[mode [offset]]] 
rootflags [&minus;o offset] [image
[flags [offset]]]

DESCRIPTION

With no
arguments, rdev outputs an /etc/mtab line for
the current root file system. With no arguments,
ramsize, vidmode, and rootflags print
usage information.

In a bootable
image for the Linux kernel on i386, there are several pairs
of bytes which specify the root device, the video mode, and
the size of the RAM disk. These pairs of bytes, by default,
begin at offset 504 (decimal) in the kernel image:

498 Root flags

(500 and 502 Reserved) 
504 RAM Disk Size 
506 VGA Mode 
508 Root Device 
(510 Boot Signature)

rdev
will change these values.

Typical values
for the image parameter, which is a bootable Linux
kernel image, might be:

/vmlinux 
/vmunix 
/boot/bzImage-2.4.0 
/dev/fd0 
/dev/fd1

When using the
rdev command, the root_device parameter might
be something like:

/dev/hda1 
/dev/hdf13 
/dev/sda2 
/dev/sdc4 
/dev/ida/c0d0p1

One may also
specify the device by a comma-separated pair of decimal
integers major,minor.

For the
ramsize command, the size parameter specifies
the size of the RAM disk in kilobytes. 2.0.x kernels and
newer dynamically allocate the ramdisk and do not need this
setting.

For the
rootflags command, the flags parameter
contains extra information used when mounting root.
Currently the only effect of these flags is to force the
kernel to mount the root filesystem in readonly mode if
flags is non-zero.

For the
vidmode command, the mode parameter specifies
the video mode:

-3 = Prompt

-2 = Extended VGA 
-1 = Normal VGA 
0 = as if "0" was pressed at the prompt 
1 = as if "1" was pressed at the prompt 
2 = as if "2" was pressed at the prompt 
n = as if "n" was pressed at the prompt

If the
value is not specified, the image will be
examined to determine the current settings.

OPTIONS

&minus;r

Causes rdev to act like
ramsize (Not relevant for 2.0.x and newer
kernels). 

&minus;R

Causes rdev to act like rootflags.

&minus;v

Causes rdev to act like vidmode.

&minus;h

Provides help.

BUGS

The rdev
utility, when used other than to find a name for the current
root device, is an ancient hack that works by patching a
kernel image at a magic offset with magic numbers. It does
not work on architectures other than i386. Its use is
strongly discouraged. Use a boot loader like SysLinux or
LILO instead.

HISTORY

At offset 502
there used to be the device number of the swap device (in
Linux 0.12), and "rdev -s" or "swapdev"
would set this. However, since Linux 0.95 this constant is
not used any longer, and the swap device is specified using
the swapon(2) system call.

At offset 504
there used to be the size of the ramdisk in kilobytes. One
would specify a size, and this much was grabbed off the top
of memory. In Linux 1.1.39 it became also possible to set
this value on the kernel command line. In Linux 1.3.48 the
ramdisk setup was changed. Ramdisk memory is now taken from
the buffer cache, so that the ramdisk can grow dynamically.
The interpretation of the ramdisk word was changed to a word
of which the high order bit is a prompt flag (1: prompt for
ramdisk: "VFS: Insert ramdisk floppy and press
ENTER" - this is needed with a two-floppy boot), the
next bit a load flag (1: load ramdisk), and the low order 11
bits give the starting block number of the root filesystem
image (so that one can have a single floppy boot). See also
linux/Documentation/ramdisk.txt.
