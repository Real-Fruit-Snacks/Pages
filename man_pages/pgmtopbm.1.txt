       [-randomseed integer]

       [pgmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       This program is almost  entirely  obsolete  since  Netpbm  10.23  (July
       2004).  Use pamditherbw(1) to do what this program used to do.

       pgmtopbm  never  was  the simple converter it appeared to be.  It was a
       dithering program.  Unfortunately, it didn't do the dithering  properly
       because  it treated the PGM input samples as if they were directly pro‐
       portional to light intensity, but they are actually gamma-adjusted.

       pamditherbw is backward compatible with pgmtopbm except that it

       •      does the correct gamma adjustments.

       •      produces PAM output instead of  PBM.   (Modern  Netpbm  programs
              that accept PBM input also accept PAM input, but if you need ac‐
              tual PBM, you can use pamtopnm with pamditherbw).

              So use the manual for pamditherbw for  pgmtopbm,  except  ignore
              anything  that  says it was added after Netpbm Release 10.23 and
              ignore any options that are not shown in the synopsis above.

       Although pgmtopbm is  mostly  obsolete,  the  simple  threshold  method
       (specified by -threshold) is an exception.  Unlike the other conversion
       methods, gamma-adjustment is not an issue with simple thresholding  and
       pgmtopbm can produce PBM output directly.  Note that even in this basic
       mode of operation pgmtopbm may produce output which is slightly differ‐
       ent  from what pamditherbw does because of differences in internal cal‐
       culation.

       If you just want to convert a PGM image with maxval 1 to PBM, use  pam‐
       topnm(1).
