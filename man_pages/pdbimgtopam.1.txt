NAME
       pdbimgtopam  - convert a Palm Pilot Image Viewer PDB Image to a PAM im‐
       age

SYNOPSIS
       pdbimgtopam

       [-notefile=filename] [-verbose]

       [pdbimgfile]

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       pdbimgtopam reads a Palm Pilot Image Viewer image (and Image record  in
       a  PDB  file) as input, from Standard Input or palmfile, and produces a
       PAM image as output.

       If the Pilot image is monochrome, the PAM output has maxval 1.   Other‐
       wise, it has maxval 255.  Note that Pilot images are always monochrome.
       The PAM image has tuple type GRAYSCALE.

OPTIONS
       In addition to the options common to all programs  based  on  libnetpbm
       (most notably -quiet, see
        Common  Options  ⟨index.html#commonoptions⟩  ), pdbimgtopam recognizes
       the following command line options:

       -verbose
              Display various interesting information about the input file and
              process.

       -notefile=filename
              Write the image note (if any) to the specified file.

              If you don't specify this, pdbimgtopam ignores any image note.

HISTORY
       pdbimgtopam  was new in Netpbm 10.52 (September 2010).  It was modelled
       after Eric A. Howe's imgvtopbm package, which dates back  to  September
       1997.
