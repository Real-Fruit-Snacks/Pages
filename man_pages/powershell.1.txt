NAME

powershell
− powerful terminal emulator for GNOME

SYNOPSIS

powershell

DESCRIPTION

This manual
page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution
because the original program does not have a manual
page.

powershell
is a GNOME/GTK+ based terminal emulator which supports many
terminals in a single window (limited only by available
RAM). Each terminal is given a "notebook" tab
which makes switching between terminals easy. It also has
URL recognition capabilities and things like transparency,
pixmap backgrounds, etc.
