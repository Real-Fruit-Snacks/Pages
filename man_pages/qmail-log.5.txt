qmail-send is done.

FATAL PROBLEMS

alert:
cannot start: ...

qmail-send is unable to
prepare itself for delivering messages; it is giving up.
This normally indicates a serious configuration error, but
it can be caused by a temporary lack of resources.

...

One of the other daemons has
died. qmail-send will exit as soon as possible.

SERIOUS PROBLEMS

alert:

record a permanent failure, usually because the disk is
full. This is a very serious problem; qmail-send
cannot proceed without recording the results. It will try
again in ten seconds.

alert: out of
memory...

qmail-send tried to
allocate more memory and failed. It will try again in ten
seconds.

alert: unable to
opendir...

qmail-send is having
trouble reading a file list from disk, usually because the
system&rsquo;s file descriptor table is full, but possibly
because permissions are set incorrectly. It will try again
in ten seconds.

alert: unable to switch
back...

qmail-send was sent
SIGHUP, and it is unable to reenter the queue directory.
This is a very serious problem; qmail-send cannot
proceed outside the queue directory. It will try again in
ten seconds.

alert: unable to
reread...

qmail-send was sent
SIGHUP, but it is unable to read the new controls. It will
continue operating with the original controls.

MESSAGES

new msg
m

qmail-send is going to
preprocess a queued message. The message number, m,
is its disk inode number. After a message is removed from
the queue, its number can be reused immediately.

info msg m:
bytes b from s> qp
q uid u

Message m contains
b bytes; its envelope sender is s; it was
queued by a user with user ID u. q is a
long-term queue identifier, the process ID of the
qmail-queue that queued the message.

bounce msg m
qp q

Message m had some
delivery failures. The long-term queue identifier of the
bounce (or double-bounce) message is q.

triple bounce: discarding
...

Message m had some
delivery failures, but it is already a double-bounce
message, so it must be thrown away. Triple-bounce messages
do not exist.

end msg m

qmail-send is about to
remove message m from the queue.

DELIVERIES

starting
delivery d: msg m to ...

qmail-send is telling
qmail-lspawn or qmail-rspawn to deliver
message m to one recipient. The delivery number,
d, starts at 1 and increases by 1 for each new
delivery.

delivery d:

Delivery d was
successful.

delivery d:
failure: ...

Delivery d failed
permanently. The message will bounce.

delivery d:
