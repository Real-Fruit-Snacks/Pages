NAME

policy.conf
âˆ’ configuration file for security policy

SYNOPSIS

/etc/security/policy.conf

DESCRIPTION

The
policy.conf file provides the security policy
configuration for user-level attributes. Each entry consists
of a key/value pair in the form:

key=value

The following
keys are defined: 
AUTHS_GRANTED

Specifies the default set of
authorizations granted to all users. This entry is
interpreted by chkauthattr(3SECDB). The value is one
or more comma-separated authorizations defined in
auth_attr(4).

PROFS_GRANTED

Specifies the default set of
profiles granted to all users. This entry is interpreted by
chkauthattr(3SECDB) and getexecuser(3SECDB).
The value is one or more comma-separated profiles defined in
prof_attr(4).

The key/value
pair must appear on a single line, and the key must start
the line. Lines starting with # are taken as comments
and ignored. Option name comparisons are
case-insensitive.
