NAME

mh-sequence -
sequence specification for nmh message system

DESCRIPTION

A sequence (or
sequence set) is a symbolic name representing a message or
collection of messages. nmh has several internally
defined sequences, as well as allowing users to define their
own sequences.

Message
Specification and Pre-Defined Message Sequences 
Most nmh commands accept a &rsquo;msg&rsquo; or
&rsquo;msgs&rsquo; specification, where &rsquo;msg&rsquo;
indicates one message and &rsquo;msgs&rsquo; indicates one
or more messages. To designate a message, you may use either
its number (e.g., 1, 10, 234) or one of these
&ldquo;reserved&rdquo; message names:

first

the first message in the folder

last

the last message in the folder

cur

the most recently accessed message

prev

the message numerically preceding &ldquo;cur&rdquo;

next

the message numerically following &ldquo;cur&rdquo;

In commands
that take a &rsquo;msg&rsquo; argument, the default is
&ldquo;cur&rdquo;. As a shorthand, &ldquo;.&rdquo; is
equivalent to &ldquo;cur&rdquo;.

For example: In
a folder containing five messages numbered 5, 10, 94, 177
and 325, &ldquo;first&rdquo; is 5 and &ldquo;last&rdquo; is
325. If &ldquo;cur&rdquo; is 94, then &ldquo;prev&rdquo; is
10 and &ldquo;next&rdquo; is 177.

The word
&rsquo;msgs&rsquo; indicates that one or more messages may
be specified. Such a specification consists of one message
designation or of several message designations, as separate
arguments. A message designation consists either of a
message name as defined above, or a message range.

A message range
is specified as &ldquo;name1-name2&rdquo; or
&ldquo;name:n&rdquo;, where &rsquo;name&rsquo;,
&rsquo;name1&rsquo; and &rsquo;name2&rsquo; are message
names, and &rsquo;n&rsquo; is an integer.

The
specification &ldquo;name1-name2&rdquo; designates all
currently existing messages from &rsquo;name1&rsquo; to
&rsquo;name2&rsquo; inclusive. The &ldquo;reserved&rdquo;
message name &ldquo;all&rdquo; is a shorthand for the
message range &ldquo;first-last&rdquo;.

The
specification &ldquo;name:n&rdquo; designates up to
&rsquo;n&rsquo; messages. These messages start with
&rsquo;name&rsquo; if &rsquo;name&rsquo; is a message number
or one of the reserved names &ldquo;first&rdquo;
&ldquo;cur&rdquo;, or &ldquo;next&rdquo;, The messages end
with &rsquo;name&rsquo; if &rsquo;name&rsquo; is
&ldquo;prev&rdquo; or &ldquo;last&rdquo;. The interpretation
of &rsquo;n&rsquo; may be overridden by preceding
&rsquo;n&rsquo; with a plus or minus sign; &rsquo;+n&rsquo;
always means up to &rsquo;n&rsquo; messages starting with
&rsquo;name&rsquo;, and &rsquo;-n&rsquo; always means up to
&rsquo;n&rsquo; messages ending with &rsquo;name&rsquo;.

Substituting
&rsquo;=&rsquo; for &rsquo;:&rsquo; (i.e.,
&ldquo;name=n&rdquo;) will reduce the selection from a range
of up to &rsquo;n&rsquo; messages, to a selection of just
the &rsquo;n&rsquo;th message. So for example, while
&ldquo;name:-3&rdquo; selects the 3 messages ending with
&rsquo;name&rsquo;, &ldquo;name=-3&rdquo; selects just the
2nd previous message. It is an error if the requested
message does not exist (i.e., there aren&rsquo;t enough
messages in the folder).

In commands
which accept a &rsquo;msgs&rsquo; argument, the default is
either &ldquo;cur&rdquo; or &ldquo;all&rdquo;, depending on
which makes more sense for each command (see the individual
man pages for details). Repeated specifications of the same
message have the same effect as a single specification of
the message.

There is also a
special &ldquo;reserved&rdquo; message name
&ldquo;new&rdquo; which is used by the mhpath
command.

User-Defined
Message Sequences 
In addition to the &ldquo;reserved&rdquo; (pre-defined)
message names given above, nmh supports user-defined
sequence names. User-defined sequences allow the nmh
user a tremendous amount of power in dealing with groups of
messages in the same folder by allowing the user to bind a
group of messages to a meaningful symbolic name.

The name used
to denote a message sequence must consist of an alphabetic
character followed by zero or more alphanumeric characters,
and can not be one of the &ldquo;reserved&rdquo; message
names above. After defining a sequence, it can be used
wherever an nmh command expects a &rsquo;msg&rsquo;
or &rsquo;msgs&rsquo; argument.

Some forms of
message ranges are allowed with user-defined sequences. The
specification &ldquo;name:n&rdquo; may be used, and it
designates up to the first &rsquo;n&rsquo; messages (or last
&rsquo;n&rsquo; messages for &rsquo;-n&rsquo;) which are
elements of the user-defined sequence
&rsquo;name&rsquo;.

The
specifications &ldquo;name:next&rdquo; and
&ldquo;name:prev&rdquo; may also be used, and they designate
the next or previous message (relative to the current
message) which is an element of the user-defined sequence
&rsquo;name&rsquo;. The specifications
&ldquo;name:first&rdquo; and &ldquo;name:last&rdquo; are
equivalent to &ldquo;name:1&rdquo; and
&ldquo;name:-1&rdquo;, respectively. The specification
&ldquo;name:cur&rdquo; is not allowed (use just
&ldquo;cur&rdquo; instead). The syntax of these message
range specifications is subject to change in the future.

Single messages
(as opposed to ranges) may also be selected by substituting
&rsquo;=&rsquo; for &rsquo;:&rsquo;, as in
&ldquo;name=n&rdquo;. This will reduce the selection from
being a range of up to &rsquo;n&rsquo; messages, to being a
selection of just the &rsquo;n&rsquo;th message. So while
&ldquo;seq:5&rdquo; selects the first 5 messages of sequence
&rsquo;seq&rsquo;, &ldquo;seq=5&rdquo; selects just the 5th
message of the sequence. It is an error if the requested
message does not exist (i.e., there aren&rsquo;t at least
&rsquo;n&rsquo; messages in the sequence).

User-defined
sequence names are specific to each folder. They are defined
using the pick and mark commands.

Public and
Private User-Defined Sequences 
There are two varieties of user-defined sequences: public
and private. Public sequences of a folder are accessible to
any nmh user that can read that folder. They are kept
in each folder in the file determined by the
&ldquo;mh-sequences&rdquo; profile entry (default is
.mh_sequences). Private sequences are accessible only
to the nmh user that defined those sequences and are
kept in the user&rsquo;s nmh context file.

In general, the
commands that create sequences (such as pick and
mark) will create public sequences if the folder for
which the sequences are being defined is writable by the
nmh user. For most commands, this can be overridden
by using the switches -public and -private.
But if the folder is read-only, or if the
&ldquo;mh-sequences&rdquo; profile entry is defined but
empty, then private sequences will be created
instead.

Sequence
Negation 
Nmh provides the ability to select all messages not
elements of a user-defined sequence. To do this, the user
should define the entry &ldquo;Sequence-Negation&rdquo; in
the nmh profile file; its value may be any string.
This string is then used to preface an existing user-defined
sequence name. This specification then refers to those
messages not elements of the specified sequence name. For
example, if the profile entry is:

Sequence-Negation:
not

then any time
an nmh command is given &ldquo;notfoo&rdquo; as a
&rsquo;msg&rsquo; or &rsquo;msgs&rsquo; argument, it would
substitute all messages that are not elements of the
sequence &ldquo;foo&rdquo;.

Obviously, the
user should beware of defining sequences with names that
begin with the value of the &ldquo;Sequence-Negation&rdquo;
profile entry.

The Previous
Sequence 
Nmh provides the ability to remember the
&rsquo;msgs&rsquo; or &rsquo;msg&rsquo; argument last given
to an nmh command. The entry
&ldquo;Previous-Sequence&rdquo; should be defined in the
nmh profile; its value should be a sequence name or
multiple sequence names, as separate arguments. If this
entry is defined, when an nmh command finishes, it
will define the sequence(s) named in the value of this entry
to be those messages that were specified to the command.
Hence, a profile entry of

Previous-Sequence:
pseq

directs any
nmh command that accepts a &rsquo;msg&rsquo; or
&rsquo;msgs&rsquo; argument to define the sequence
&ldquo;pseq&rdquo; as those messages when it finishes.

Note:
there can be a performance penalty in using the
&ldquo;Previous-Sequence&rdquo; facility. If it is used,
all nmh programs have to write the sequence
information to the .mh_sequences file for the folder
each time they run. If the &ldquo;Previous-Sequence&rdquo;
profile entry is not included, only pick and
mark will write to the .mh_sequences file.

The Unseen
Sequence 
Finally, many users like to indicate which messages have not
been previously seen by them. The commands flist,
inc, mhshow, rcvstore, and show
honor the profile entry &ldquo;Unseen-Sequence&rdquo; to
support this activity. This entry in the .mh_profile
should be defined as one or more sequence names, as separate
arguments. If there is a value for
&ldquo;Unseen-Sequence&rdquo; in the profile, then whenever
new messages are placed in a folder (using inc or
rcvstore), the new messages will also be added to all
the sequences named in this profile entry. For example, a
profile entry of

Unseen-Sequence:
unseen

directs
inc to add new messages to the sequence
&ldquo;unseen&rdquo;. Unlike the behavior of the
&ldquo;Previous-Sequence&rdquo; entry in the profile,
however, the sequence(s) will not be zeroed by
inc.

Similarly,
whenever show, mhshow, next, or
prev displays a message, that message will be removed
from any sequences named by the
&ldquo;Unseen-Sequence&rdquo; entry in the profile.

Sequence
File Format 
The sequence file format is based on the RFC 5322 message
format. Each line of the sequence file corresponds to one
sequence. The line starts with the sequence name followed by
a &rsquo;:&rsquo;, then followed by a space-separated list
of message numbers that correspond to messages that are part
of the named sequence. A contiguous range of messages can be
represented as &ldquo;lownum-highnum&rdquo;.

Sample
sequence file

work: 3 6 8
22-33 46 
unseen: 47 49-51 54 
cur: 46

Nmh
commands that modify the sequence file will silently remove
sequences for nonexistent messages when the sequence file is
updated. The exception to this is the &ldquo;cur&rdquo;
sequence, which is allowed to point to a nonexistent
message.

Sequence
File Locking 
The &ldquo;datalocking&rdquo; profile entry controls the
type of locking used when reading and writing sequence
files. The locking mechanisms supported are detailed in
mh-profile(5). This protects sequence file integrity
when multiple nmh commands are run simultaneously.
Nmh commands that modify the sequence file use
transactional locks; the lock is held from the time the
sequence file is read until it it written out. This ensures
that modifications to the sequence file will not be lost if
multiple commands are run simultaneously. Long-running
nmh commands, such as inc and pick,
will release the sequence lock during the bulk of their
runtime and reread the sequence file after their processing
is complete to reduce lock contention time.

Note: Currently
transactional locks are only supported for public sequences;
private sequences will not get corrupted, but the
possibility exists that two nmh commands run
simultaneously that add messages to a private sequence could
result in one command&rsquo;s messages not appearing on the
requested sequence.
