sane-xerox_mfp(5)        SANE Scanner Access Now Easy        sane-xerox_mfp(5)

NAME
       sane-xerox_mfp - SANE backend for Xerox Phaser 3200MFP device et al.

DESCRIPTION
       The  sane-xerox_mfp library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy)
       backend that provides access to several Samsung-based  Samsung,  Xerox,
       and  Dell  scanners.   Please  see  full  list  of supported devices at
       http://www.sane-project.org/sane-supported-devices.html.

CONFIGURATION
       /etc/sane.d/xerox_mfp.conf
              USB scanners do not need any configuration.

              For SCX-4500W in network mode you need to specify

              tcp host_address [port]

       The host_address is passed through resolver, thus can be a dotted  quad
       or a name from /etc/hosts or resolvable through DNS.

FILES
       /etc/sane.d/xerox_mfp.conf
              The   backend   configuration   file.  By  default  all  scanner
              types/models are enabled, you may want to comment  out  unwanted
              entries.

       /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-xerox_mfp.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-xerox_mfp.so
              The shared library implementing this backend (present on systems
              that support dynamic loading).

ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_DEBUG_XEROX_MFP
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this en‐
              vironment  variable  controls  the debug level for this backend.
              Higher debug levels increase the verbosity of the output.

              Example: export SANE_DEBUG_XEROX_MFP=4

LIMITATIONS
       Multicast autoconfiguration for LAN scanners is  not  implemented  yet.
       IPv6 addressing has never been tested.
