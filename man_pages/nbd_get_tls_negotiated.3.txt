NAME

nbd_get_tls_negotiated
- find out if TLS was negotiated on a connection

SYNOPSIS

#include

int nbd_get_tls_negotiated ( 
struct nbd_handle *h 
);

DESCRIPTION

After
connecting you may call this to find out if the connection
is using TLS.

This is
normally useful only if you set the TLS request mode to
"LIBNBD_TLS_ALLOW" (see nbd_set_tls(3)),
because in this mode we try to use TLS but fall back to
unencrypted if it was not available. This function will tell
you if TLS was negotiated or not.

In
"LIBNBD_TLS_REQUIRE" mode (the most secure) the
connection would have failed if TLS could not be negotiated.
With "LIBNBD_TLS_DISABLE" mode, TLS is not tried
automatically; but if the NBD server uses the less-common
"SELECTIVETLS" mode, this function reports whether
a manual nbd_opt_starttls(3) enabled TLS or if the
connection is still plaintext.

RETURN VALUE

This call
returns a boolean value.

ERRORS

On error -1 is
returned.

Refer to
"ERROR HANDLING" in libnbd(3) for how to
get further details of the error.

The following
parameters must not be NULL: "h". For more
information see "Non-NULL parameters" in
libnbd(3).
