Lintian::Processable::DiffstDebian Package ChLintian::Processable::Diffstat(3)

NAME
       Lintian::Processable::Diffstat - access to collected diffstat data

SYNOPSIS
           use Lintian::Processable;

DESCRIPTION
       Lintian::Processable::Diffstat provides an interface to diffstat data.

INSTANCE METHODS
       diffstat
           Returns the path to diffstat output run on the Debian packaging
           diff (a.k.a. the "diff.gz") for 1.0 non-native packages.  For
           source packages without a "diff.gz" component, this returns the
           path to an empty file (this may be a device like /dev/null).
