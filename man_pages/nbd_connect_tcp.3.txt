NAME

nbd_connect_tcp
- connect to NBD server over a TCP port

SYNOPSIS

#include

int nbd_connect_tcp ( 
struct nbd_handle *h, const char *hostname, 
const char *port 
);

DESCRIPTION

Connect
(synchronously) to the NBD server listening on
"hostname:port". The "port" may be a
port name such as "nbd", or it may be a port
number as a string such as "10809".

This call
returns when the connection has been made. By default, this
proceeds all the way to transmission phase, but
nbd_set_opt_mode(3) can be used for manual control
over option negotiation performed before transmission
phase.

RETURN VALUE

If the call is
successful the function returns 0.

ERRORS

On error -1 is
returned.

Refer to
"ERROR HANDLING" in libnbd(3) for how to
get further details of the error.

The following
parameters must not be NULL: "h",
"hostname", "port". For more information
see "Non-NULL parameters" in libnbd(3).
