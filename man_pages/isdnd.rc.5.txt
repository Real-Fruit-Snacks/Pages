NAME

isdnd.rc &mdash; isdn4bsd
ISDN connection management daemon config file format

DESCRIPTION

The file
/etc/isdn/isdnd.rc contains (if not otherwise
specified on the command line) the runtime configuration for
the isdnd(8) ISDN connection management daemon which is part
of the isdn4bsd package.

The
configuration file consists of keywords which start in
column 1 followed by one or more spaces or tabs, an equal
sign, one or more spaces or tabs and a keyword dependent
parameter value.

A line beginning
with &rsquo;#&rsquo; is treated as a comment line.

For keywords
requiring the specification of a boolean value, the truth
value can be either yes or on while the false
value can be either no or off.

The
configuration file consists of one system section,
one or more optional controller sections and one or
more entry sections. In the system section
parameters regarding the daemon operation or parameters not
associated with a single remote connection can be set. In
the controller section parameters regarding a
particular controller can be set. In the entry
section(s) parameters directly associated with a single
remote connection can be set.

The following
keywords are recognized by isdnd:

system

This keyword
starts the system configuration section. It must not have a
parameter and may be used only once. The keyword is
mandatory. The following keywords are valid in the system
configuration section:

acctall

If this
parameter is set to on, accounting information is
written even if the local site was not charged or no
charging information is available or is not subscribed.
(optional)

acctfile

Specifies the
name of the accounting file which is used when the keyword
useacctfile (see below) is set to on. See also
system keyword rotatesuffix. If this keyword is
omitted the system default is used. (optional)

add-prefix

If set to
on, for incoming numbers, have a look at the
"type of number" indicator and adjust the number
as specified by the prefix-national and
prefix-international keywords described later. If
this keyword is omitted, the system default (off) is used.
(optional)

aliasing

If this
parameter is set to on, alias processing of
telephone-number to name is enabled (see also the
aliasfile keyword below). The default is off.
(optional)

aliasfile

Specifies the
name of the telephone number-to-name alias database file
shared with the isdntel(1) utility when alias processing is
enabled via the aliasing keyword. (optional)

beepconnect

In full-screen
mode, if this parameter is set to on, ring the bell
when connecting or disconnecting a call.

extcallattr

If this
parameter is set to on, the extended caller
attributes "screening indicator" and
"presentation indicator" are written to the
log-file. The default is off. (optional)

holidayfile

Specifies the
name of the holiday file containing the dates of holidays.
This file is used in conjunction with the valid
keyword to lookup the dates of holidays. (optional)

isdntime

If this
parameter is set to on, date/time information from
the exchange (if provided) is written to the log-file. The
default is off. (optional)

mailer

This keyword is
used to specify the path/name of a mail program which is
able to use the "-s" flag to specify a subject on
its command line. In case of a fatal error exit of
isdnd.rc this program is used to send mail to an
administrator specified by the keyword mailto.
(optional)

mailto

This keyword is
used to specify the email address of someone to notify in
case of a fatal error exit of isdnd.rc. (See also
keyword mailer). (optional)

monitor-allowed

If this parameter is set to
on or yes, monitoring via a local or remote
machine is enabled. This parameter is optional and is set to
off by default.

monitor-port

sets the TCP port number for
remote monitoring. This integer parameter is optional and is
set to port 451 by default.

monitor

This keyword
specifies a local socket name or a host or network for
remote monitoring. The monitor specification may
either be:

the name of a local
(UNIX-domain) socket

this MUST start with a
"/", example: /var/run/isdn-monitor

a dotted-quad host specification

example: 192.168.1.2

a dotted-quad network address with netmask

example: 192.168.1.0/24

a resolvable host name

example: localhost

a resolvable network name with netmask

example: up-vision-net/24

monitor-access

This keyword specifies the
access rights for a previously used monitor keyword.
The supported access rights are:

fullcmd 
restrictedcmd 
channelstate 
logevents 
callin 
callout

prefix-international

In conjunction with the
add-prefix switch (see above), specify the prefix
number string for incoming numbers with the international
number tag. If aliases are used, they have to be adjusted
accordingly. (optional)

prefix-national

In conjunction with the
add-prefix switch (see above), specify the prefix
number string for incoming numbers with the national number
tag. If aliases are used, they have to be adjusted
accordingly. (optional)

ratesfile

Specifies the
name of the ratesfile. If this keyword is omitted the system
default is used. (optional)

regexpr

This keyword is
used to specify regular expressions. It can be specified
more than once up to a compile time dependent value
(currently set to 5 by the MAX_RE definition in the
source).

All specified
regular expressions are compared to the log strings at
runtime and if a match is found, a program is run with the
log text as a parameter (see also the keyword regprog
below).

For an
explanation how regular expressions are specified, please
have a look at re_format(7) and regex(3). The
extended regular expression syntax is supported
here.

Hint: it might
be necessary to properly quote the expression to avoid
improper interpretation by the configuration file parser.
(optional)

regprog

This keyword is
used to specify the name of a program which is run in case a
corresponding regular expression is matched by a logging
string. Isdnd expects to find the program below the
path /etc/isdn which is prepended to the string
specified as a parameter to this keyword. (optional)

rotatesuffix

Specifies a suffix for renaming
the log- and the accounting-filename. In case rotatesuffix
is used and a USR1 signal is sent to isdnd, the log-file and
the accounting file is not only closed and reopened but the
old log-file is also renamed to the former filename with the
rotatesuffix string appended. If this keyword is omitted,
the log-files are just closed and reopened; this is also the
default behavior. (optional)

rtprio

Specifies the
real-time priority isdnd runs at as an integer value
in the range 0...31 with 0 being the highest priority. This
keyword is optional; if not specified the process priority
of isdnd is not touched in any way. ( See also
rtprio(1)). This keyword is only available if
isdnd.rc was compiled with -DUSE_RTPRIO.

useacctfile

If this
parameter is set to on charging (if available) and
accounting information is written to the accounting file.
(optional)

controller

This keyword starts the
controller configuration section. It must not have a
parameter and may be used once for every controller. The
keyword is optional. The following keywords are valid in a
controller configuration section:

protocol

This keyword is
used to set the D-channel protocol for the S0-bus a
controller is connected to. The following parameters are
currently supported:

dss1

The DSS1 or
so-called "Euro-ISDN" D-channel protocol according
to ITU Recommendations Q.921 and Q.931.

d64s

An ISDN leased
line with a single B-channel (called D64S in Germany).

firmware

This keyword is
used like firmware=/path/to/file to download the
firmware to active controllers supported by the iavc
driver (AVM B1, T1). This keyword is supported for all
controller types, and causes I4B_CTRL_DOWNLOAD ioctl to be
invoked with the specified file as an argument. In systems
equipped with both active and passive adapters, and the
passive cards being detected first, dummy
&rsquo;controller&rsquo; entries are required for the
passive cards to get the correct firmwares to correct
adapters.

entry

This keyword
starts one configuration entry. It must not have a
parameter. This keyword must be used at least once. The
following keywords are valid in an entry section:

answerprog

This keyword is
used to specify the name of a program which is run in case
an incoming telephone connection specified answer in
its configuration entry. The default name is answer.
Isdnd expects to find this program beneath the path
/etc/isdn which is prepended to the string specified
as a parameter to this keyword. (optional)

alert

is used to
specify a time in seconds to wait before accepting a call.
This keyword is only usable for incoming telephone calls
(dialin-reaction = answer). It is used to have a chance to
accept an incoming call on the phone before the answering
machine starts to run. The minimum value for the alert
parameter is 5 seconds and the maximum parameter allowed is
180 seconds. (optional)

b1protocol

The B channel
layer 1 protocol used for this connection. The keyword is
mandatory. The currently configurable values are:

hdlc

HDLC
framing.

raw

No framing at
all (used for telephony).

bcap

Use a special
bearer capability for this connection. The keyword is
optional.

Any other value
than dov sets the bearer capability as configured by
the b1protocol keyword (see above). The currently
configurable values are:

dov

This connection
is a Dov (Data over Voice) connection. The b1protocol
keyword must be set to hdlc. This feature is
experimental and does work on outgoing calls only.

budget-calloutperiod

is used to specify a time
period in seconds. Within this period, the number of calls
specified by budget-calloutncalls are allowed to
succeed, any further attempt to call out will be blocked for
the rest of the time left in the time period. (optional)

budget-calloutncalls

The number of outgoing calls
allowed within the time period specified by
budget-calloutperiod. (optional)

budget-calloutsfile

A path/filename to which the
number of successfull callouts are written. The contents of
the file is preserved when it exists during startup of
isdnd. The format of this file is: start time, last update
time, number of calls. (optional)

budget-calloutsfile-rotate

If set to on rotate
budget-calloutsfile every night when an attempt is made to
update the file on a new day. The statistics for the
previous day are witten to a file with the filename
specified by budget-calloutsfile to which a hyphen and the
new day&rsquo;s (!) day of month number is appended.
(optional)

budget-callbackperiod

budget-callbackncalls

budget-callbacksfile

budget-calloutsfile-rotate

See
budget-calloutperiod, budget-calloutncalls,
budget-calloutsfile, and
budget-calloutsfile-rotate above. These are used to
specify the budgets for calling back a remote site.

callbackwait

The time in
seconds to wait between hanging up the call from a remote
site and calling back the remote site. (optional)

calledbackwait

The time in seconds to wait for
a remote site calling back the local site after a call from
the local site to the remote site has been made.
(optional)

clone

This causes the
contents of the specified entry to be copied from the
existing named entry to the current one. When using this
feature at least a new entry specific &rsquo;name&rsquo; and
&rsquo;usrdeviceunit&rsquo; value should be specified for
the current entry.

connectprog

specifies a
program run every time after a connection is established and
address negotiation is complete (i.e.: the connection is
usable). Isdnd expects to find the program below the
path /etc/isdn which is prepended to the string
specified as a parameter to this keyword. The programs
specified by connect and disconnect will get the following
command line arguments: -d (device) -f (flag) [ -a (addr) ]
where device is the name of device, e.g.
"isp0", flag will be "up" if
connection just got up, or "down" if interface
changed to down state and addr the address that got
assigned to the interface as a dotted-quad ip address
(optional, only if it can be figured out by isdnd).
(optional)

dialin-reaction

Used to specify what to do when
an incoming connection request is received. The keyword is
mandatory. The currently supported parameters are:

accept

Accept an
incoming call.

reject

Reject an
incoming call.

ignore

Ignore an
incoming call.

answer

Start telephone
answering for an incoming voice call.

callback

When a remote
site calls, hang up and call back the remote site.

dialout-type

This keyword is
used to configure what type of dialout mode is used. The
keyword is mandatory. The currently supported parameters
are:

normal

Normal
behavior, call the remote site which is supposed to accept
the call.

calledback

Callback behavior, call the
remote side which rejects the call and calls us back.

dialrandincr

When dialing or
re-dialing and this parameter is set to on, the dial
retry time is added with a random value (currently 0...3
seconds) to minimize the chance of two sites dialing
synchronously so each gets a busy each time it dials because
the other side is also dialing.

dialretries

The number of
dialing retries before giving up. Setting this to -1
gives an unlimited number of retries! (optional)

direction

This keyword is
used to configure if incoming and outgoing, incoming-only or
outgoing only connections are possible. The keyword is
optional, the default is inout.

The currently
supported parameters are:

inout

Normal
behavior, connection establishment is possible from remote
and local.

in

Only incoming
connections are possible.

out

Only outgoing
connections are possible.

disconnectprog

specifies a program run every
time after a connection was shut down. Isdnd expects
to find the program below the path /etc/isdn which is
prepended to the string specified as a parameter to this
keyword. (optional)

downtries

is used to
configure the number of unsuccessful tries (= retry cycles!)
before the interface is disabled (for downtime
seconds). (see also the keyword usedown further up).
This keyword is optional.

downtime

is used to
configure the time in seconds an interface is disabled after
the configured number of downtries. (see also the
keyword usedown further up). This keyword is optional
and is set to 60 seconds by default.

earlyhangup

A (safety) time
in seconds which specifies the time to hang up before an
expected next charging unit will occur. (optional)

idle-algorithm-outgoing

The algorithm used to determine
when to hang up an outgoing call when the line becomes idle.
The current algorithms are:

fix-unit-size

idle algorithm which assumes
fixed sized charging units during the whole call.

var-unit-size

idle algorithm which assumes
that the charging is time based after the first units time
has expired.

idletime-outgoing

The time in seconds an outgoing
connection must be idle before hanging up. An idle timeout
of zero disables this functionality. (optional)

idletime-incoming

The time in seconds an incoming
connection must be idle before hanging up. An idle timeout
of zero disables this functionality. (optional)

isdncontroller

The ISDN controller number to
be used for connections for this entry. (mandatory)

isdnchannel

The ISDN
controller channel number to be used for connections for
this entry. In case a channel is explicitly selected here,
the SETUP message will request this channel but mark the
request as preferred (the indicated channel is
preferred) instead of exclusive (only the indicated channel
is acceptable). Thus the exchange is still free to select
another than the requested channel! (mandatory)

isdntxdel-incoming

A delay value suitable for the
timeout(9) kernel subroutine to delay the transmission of
the first packet after a successful connection is made by
this value for incoming ISDN connections. The
specification unit is 1/100 second. A zero (0) disables this
feature and is the default value. This feature is
implemented (and makes sense only) for the i4bipr(4) IP over
raw HDLC ISDN driver. (optional)

isdntxdel-outgoing

A delay value suitable for the
timeout(9) kernel subroutine to delay the transmission of
the first packet after a successful connection is made by
this value for outgoing ISDN connections. The
specification unit is 1/100 second. A zero (0) disables this
feature and is the default value. This feature is
implemented (and makes sense only) for the i4bipr(4) IP over
raw HDLC ISDN driver. (optional)

local-phone-dialout

The local telephone number used
when the local site dials out. When dialing out to a remote
site, the number specified here is put into the Calling
Party Number Information Element.

This keyword is
mandatory for the ipr user-land interfaces.

local-subaddr-dialout

The local subaddress used when
the local site dials out. When dialing out to a remote site,
the subaddress specified here is put into the Calling
Party Subaddress Information Element.

This keyword is
mandatory for the ipr user-land interfaces.

local-phone-incoming

The local telephone number used
for verifying the destination of incoming calls. When a
remote site dials in, this number is used to verify that it
is the local site which the remote site wants to connect to.
It is compared with the Called Party Number Information
Element got from the telephone exchange.

This keyword is
mandatory for the ipr interfaces.

local-subaddr-incoming

The local subaddress used for
verifying the destination of incoming calls. When a remote
site dials in, this subaddress is used to verify that it is
the local site which the remote site wants to connect to. It
is compared with the Called Party Subaddress Information
Element got from the telephone exchange.

This keyword is
mandatory for the ipr interfaces.

name

Defines a
symbolic name for this configuration entry. Its purpose is
to use this name in the full-screen display for easy
identification of a link to a remote site and for accounting
purposes. (mandatory)

maxconnecttime

Specify a maximum connection
time in seconds. Use this to define an absolute upper limit
for a connection on the B-channel to last. CAUTION:
This feature is used to limit the connection time, _not_
number of attempts to establish a connection: when using
this please take care to also enable the use of budgets to
limit the connection establish attempts (otherwise the line
will cycle thru an endless loop of connections and
reconnections which will have an undesired effect on your
telco bill)!

ppp-auth-paranoid

If set to no, the remote
site is not required to prove its authentity for connections
that are initiated by the local site. The default is
yes and requires the remote site to always
authenticate.

This keyword is
only used if ppp-send-auth has been set to pap or
chap for an isp PPP interface. (optional)

ppp-auth-rechallenge

Set to no, if the other
side does not support re-challenging for chap. The default
is yes, which causes verification of the remote
site&rsquo;s authentity once in a while.

This keyword is
only used if ppp-expect-auth has been set to chap for
an isp PPP interface. (optional)

ppp-expect-auth

The local site expects the
authentity of the remote site to be proved by the specified
method. The supported methods are:

none

Do not require
the other side to authenticate. Typical uses are dial-out to
an ISP (many ISPs do not authenticate themselves to clients)
or offering anonymous dial-in at the local site.

chap

The preferred
authentication method, which does not require a password to
be sent in the clear.

pap

The unprotected
authentication method, which allows anybody watching the
wire to grab name and password.

If
ppp-auth-paranoid is set to no (the default is
yes) outgoing connections will not require the remote
site to authenticate itself.

This keyword is
only used for the isp PPP interfaces. (optional)

ppp-expect-name

The name that has to be
provided by the remote site to prove its authentity.

This keyword is
only used if ppp-expect-auth has been set to pap or
chap for an isp PPP interface. (optional)

currently supported parameters are:

none

The remote site
does not expect or support authentication.

chap

The preferred
authentication method, which does not require a password to
be sent in the clear.

pap

The unprotected
authentication method, which allows anybody watching the
wire to grab name and password.

This keyword is
only used for the isp PPP interfaces. (optional)

chap for an isp PPP interface. (optional)

ratetype

The rate entry
used from the rates file. (optional)

For example,
ratetype=0 selects lines beginning "ra0" in
/etc/isdn/isdnd.rates; (typically ra0 lines are a set of
tables for local call rates on different days of the week
& times per day).

recoverytime

The time in
seconds to wait between dial retries. (optional)

remdial-handling

is used to specify the dialout
behavior in case more than one outgoing number is specified.
The currently supported parameters are:

(non-retry) call setup, start with the last number with
which a successful connection was made.

next

For every new
(non-retry) call setup, start with the next number which
follows the last one used.

remote-phone-dialout

The remote telephone number
used when the local site dials out. When dialing out to a
remote site, the number specified here is put into the

This keyword is
mandatory for the ipr interfaces. It may be specified
more than once to try to dial to several numbers until one
succeeds.

remote-subaddr-dialout

The remote subaddress used when
the local site dials out. When dialing out to a remote site,

This keyword is
mandatory for the ipr interfaces. It may be specified
more than once to linked it to the remote-phone-dialout
numbers until one succeeds.

remote-phone-incoming

The remote telephone number
used to verify an incoming call. When a remote site dials
in, this number is used to verify that it is the correct
remote site which is herewith authorized to connect into the

telephone exchange.

This keyword is
mandatory for the ipr interfaces.

This keyword
may have a wildcard parameter &rsquo;*&rsquo; to permit
anyone dialing in.

remote-subaddr-incoming

The remote subaddress used to
verify an incoming call. When a remote site dials in, this
subaddress is used to verify that it is the correct remote

enable the use of the keywords downtries and
downtime in the entries section(s). It is used in the
isdnd daemon to dynamically enable and disable the IP
interfaces to avoid excessive dialing activities in case of
transient failures (such as busy lines). This parameter is
optional and is set to off by default.

usesubaddr

is used to
enable the use of subaddresses. This parameter is optional
and is set to off by default.

The use of this
keyword is optional.

IDLETIME CALCULATION AND
SHORT-HOLD MODE 
incoming calls

It is assumed
that the calling side knows most about charging structures
and such and as a consequence only the keyword
idletime-incoming has a function for incoming
calls.

For incoming
calls the line is constantly monitored, and in case there
was not traffic taking place for the time in seconds
specified by idletime-incoming the call is
closed.

Typically,
idletime-incoming is used as a last resort and is
therefore set much higher than a charging unit time: typical
values are one to five minutes.

outgoing calls

Outgoing call
disconnect time can be setup in one of three ways:

simple mode

For simple
mode, the idle-algorithm-outgoing must be
fix-unit-size and the selected unitlength must
be 0 (zero) and idletime-outgoing greater zero.

The outgoing
traffic is constantly monitored, and in case there was not
traffic taking place for the time in seconds specified by
idletime-outgoing the call is closed.

Typical values
in simple mode are 10 to 30 seconds.

shorthold mode for fixed unit
charging

For shorthold mode, the
idle-algorithm-outgoing must be fix-unit-size
and the selected unitlength and
idletime-outgoing must be greater than 0 (zero);
earlyhangup must be >= 0 (zero).

||||

| | | | 
+------------------+-------------+--------------+ 
| | | | 
| ||| 
||

During the
unchecked window which is (unitlength -
(idle-time+earlyhangup)) in length, no idle check is done.
After the unchecked window has ended, the line is checked
for idle-time length if no traffic takes place. In case
there was traffic detected in the check-window, the same
procedure is restarted at the beginning of the next unit. In
case no traffic was detected during the check-window, the
line is closed at the end of the check window.

Notice:
unitlength must (!) be greater than the sum of
idletime-outgoing and earlyhangup!

shorthold mode for variable unit
charging

For shorthold mode, the
idle-algorithm-outgoing must be var-unit-size
and the selected unitlength and
idletime-outgoing must be greater than 0 (zero);

This shorthold
mode is suitable when your calls are billed on the elapse
time of the call plus a fixed connection charge. For example
British Telecom bill this way.

Each call is
divided into two periods, the first is the unchecked
period and the second is the checked. The
checked period starts 1 second before the first units
time expires.

During the
checked period if there is no traffic for
idle-time seconds the call is disconnected.

||

+------------------+-------------+ 
| || 
||

Experience
shows that useful values for idle-time are from 15 to 30
seconds.

If idle-time is
too short an application that is not yet finished with the
network will cause a new call to be placed.
