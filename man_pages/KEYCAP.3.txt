KEYCAP(3) BSD Library Functions Manual KEYCAP(3)

NAME

kgetent, kgetnum,
kgetflag, kgetstr — routines for
accessing the keycap database

SYNOPSIS

int

kgetent(char *bp,
char *name);

int

kgetnum(char *id);

int

kgetflag(char *id);

char
*

kgetstr(char *id,
char **area);

DESCRIPTION

These functions extract and use
capabilities from a keyboard capability data base, usually
/usr/share/misc/keycap.pcvt, the format of which is
described in keycap(5).

The
kgetent() function extracts the entry for keyboard
mapping name into the buffer at bp. The
bp argument should be a character buffer of size 1024
and must be retained through all subsequent calls to
kgetnum(), kgetflag(), and kgetstr().
The kgetent() function returns −1 if none of
the keycap data base files could be opened, 0 if the
map name given does not have an entry, and 1 if all goes
well.

The
kgetnum() function gets the numeric value of
capability id, returning −1 if is not given for
the map.

The
kgetflag() function returns 1 if the specified
capability is present in the map’s entry, 0 if it is
not.

The
kgetstr() function returns the string value of the
capability id, places it in the buffer at
area, and advances the area pointer. The
kgetstr() function returns NULL if the capability was
not found.
