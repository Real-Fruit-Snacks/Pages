NAME
       fbdev - video driver for framebuffer device

SYNOPSIS
       Section "Device"
         Identifier "devname"
         Driver "fbdev"
         BusID  "pci:bus:dev:func"
         ...
       EndSection

DESCRIPTION
       fbdev  is an Xorg driver for framebuffer devices.  This is a non-accel‐
       erated driver, the following framebuffer depths are supported:  8,  15,
       16, 24.  All visual types are supported for depth 8, and TrueColor vis‐
       ual is supported for the other depths.  Multi-head  configurations  are
       supported.

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
       The  fbdev  driver  supports all hardware where a framebuffer driver is
       available.  fbdev uses the os-specific submodule fbdevhw(4) to talk  to
       the  kernel device driver.  Currently a fbdevhw module is available for
       linux.

CONFIGURATION DETAILS
       Please refer to xorg.conf(5) for general configuration  details.   This
       section only covers configuration details specific to this driver.

       For  this driver it is not required to specify modes in the screen sec‐
       tion of the config file.  The fbdev driver can pick  up  the  currently
       used  video  mode  from the framebuffer driver and will use it if there
       are no video modes configured.

       For PCI boards you might have to add a BusID line to  the  Device  sec‐
       tion.  See above for a sample line.

       The following driver Options are supported:

       Option "fbdev" "string"
              The framebuffer device to use. Default: /dev/fb0.

       Option "ShadowFB" "boolean"
              Enable or disable use of the shadow framebuffer layer. Mandatory
              for 24bpp framebuffers on newer servers. Default: on.

       Option "Rotate" "string"
              Enable rotation of the display. The supported  values  are  "CW"
              (clockwise,  90  degrees),  "UD"  (upside down, 180 degrees) and
              "CCW" (counter clockwise,  270  degrees).  Implies  use  of  the
              shadow  framebuffer  layer. Disabled for 24bpp framebuffers. De‐
              fault: off.
