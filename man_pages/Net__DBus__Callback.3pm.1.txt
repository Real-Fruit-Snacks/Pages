NAME
       Net::DBus::Callback - a callback for receiving reactor events

SYNOPSIS
         use Net::DBus::Callback;

         # Assume we have a 'terminal' object and its got a method
         # to be invoked every time there is input on its terminal.
         #
         # To create a callback to invoke this method one might use
         my $cb = Net::DBus::Callback->new(object => $terminal,
                                           method => "handle_stdio");

         # Whatever is monitoring the stdio channel, would then
         # invoke the callback, perhaps passing in a parameter with
         # some 'interesting' data, such as number of bytes available
         $cb->invoke($nbytes)

         #... which results in a call to
         #  $terminal->handle_stdio($nbytes)

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides a simple container for storing details about a
       callback to be invoked at a later date. It is used when registering to
       receive events from the Net::DBus::Reactor class. NB use of this module
       in application code is no longer necessary and it remains purely for
       backwards compatibility.  Instead you can simply pass a subroutine code
       reference in any place where a callback is desired.

METHODS
       my $cb = Net::DBus::Callback->new(method => $name, [args => \@args])
           Creates a new callback object, for invoking a plain old function.
           The "method" parameter should be the fully qualified function name
           to invoke, including the package name. The optional "args"
           parameter is an array reference of parameters to be pass to the
           callback, in addition to those passed into the "invoke" method.

       my $cb = Net::DBus::Callback->new(object => $object, method => $name,
       [args => \@args])
           Creates a new callback object, for invoking a method on an object.
           The "method" parameter should be the name of the method to invoke,
           while the "object" parameter should be a blessed object on which
           the method will be invoked. The optional "args" parameter is an
           array reference of parameters to be pass to the callback, in
           addition to those passed into the "invoke" method.

       $cb->invoke(@args)
           Invokes the callback. The argument list passed to the callback is a
           combination of the arguments supplied in the callback constructor,
           followed by the arguments supplied in the "invoke" method.
