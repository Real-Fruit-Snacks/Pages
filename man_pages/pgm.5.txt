NAME
       pgm - Netpbm grayscale image format

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       The  PGM  format  is a lowest common denominator grayscale file format.
       It is designed to be extremely easy to learn and  write  programs  for.
       (It's  so  simple  that most people will simply reverse engineer it be‐
       cause it's easier than reading this specification).

       A PGM image represents a  grayscale  graphic  image.   There  are  many
       pseudo-PGM  formats  in use where everything is as specified herein ex‐
       cept for the meaning of individual pixel values.  For most purposes,  a
       PGM  image  can  just be thought of an array of arbitrary integers, and
       all the programs in the world that think they're processing a grayscale
       image can easily be tricked into processing something else.

       The name "PGM" is an acronym derived from "Portable Gray Map."

       One  official  variant of PGM is the transparency mask.  A transparency
       mask in Netpbm is represented by a PGM image, except that in  place  of
       pixel intensities, there are opaqueness values.  See below.

THE FORMAT
       The  format  definition  is as follows.  You can use the libnetpbm(1) C
       subroutine library to conveniently and accurately  read  and  interpret
       the format.

       A  PGM file consists of a sequence of one or more PGM images. There are
       no data, delimiters, or padding before, after, or between images.

       Each PGM image consists of the following:

       •      A "magic number" for identifying the file type.  A  pgm  image's
              magic number is the two characters "P5".

       •      Whitespace (blanks, TABs, CRs, LFs).

       •      A width, formatted as ASCII characters in decimal.

       •      Whitespace.

       •      A height, again in ASCII decimal.

       •      Whitespace.

       •      The  maximum  gray value (Maxval), again in ASCII decimal.  Must
              be less than 65536, and more than zero.

       •      A single whitespace character (usually a newline).

       •      A raster of Height rows, in order from top to bottom.  Each  row
              consists  of  Width  gray  values,  in order from left to right.
              Each gray value is a number from 0 through Maxval, with 0  being
              black and Maxval being white.  Each gray value is represented in
              pure binary by either 1 or 2 bytes.  If the Maxval is less  than
              256, it is 1 byte.  Otherwise, it is 2 bytes.  The most signifi‐
              cant byte is first.

              A row of an image is horizontal.  A  column  is  vertical.   The
              pixels in the image are square and contiguous.

              Each gray value is a number proportional to the intensity of the
              pixel, adjusted by the ITU-R Recommendation BT.709 gamma  trans‐
              fer  function.  (That transfer function specifies a gamma number
              of 2.2 and has a linear section for small intensities).  A value
              of  zero  is  therefore black.  A value of Maxval represents CIE
              D65 white and the most intense value in the image and any  other
              image to which the image might be compared.

              BT.709's range of channel values (16-240) is irrelevant to PGM.

              Note  that a common variation from the PGM format is to have the
              gray value be "linear," i.e. as specified above  except  without
              the  gamma adjustment.  pnmgamma takes such a PGM variant as in‐
              put and produces a true PGM as output.

              Another popular variation from PGM is to  substitute  the  newer
              sRGB transfer function for the BT.709 one.  You can use pnmgamma
              to convert between this variation and true PGM.

              In the transparency mask variation from PGM,  the  value  repre‐
              sents  opaqueness.  It is proportional to the fraction of inten‐
              sity of a pixel that would show in place of an underlying pixel.
              So  what  normally  means  white represents total opaqueness and
              what normally means black represents total transparency.  In be‐
              tween,  you  would compute the intensity of a composite pixel of
              an "under" and "over" pixel as under *  (1-(alpha/alpha_maxval))
              +  over  *  (alpha/alpha_maxval).   Note  that there is no gamma
              transfer function in the transparency mask.

       Strings starting with "#" may be comments, the same as with PBM(1).

       Note that you can use pamdepth to convert between a the format  with  1
       byte per gray value and the one with 2 bytes per gray value.

       All  characters  referred  to  herein  are encoded in ASCII.  "newline"
       refers to the character known in ASCII as Line Feed or  LF.   A  "white
       space"  character  is space, CR, LF, TAB, VT, or FF (I.e. what the ANSI
       standard C isspace() function calls white space).

   Plain PGM
       There is actually another version of the  PGM  format  that  is  fairly
       rare: "plain" PGM format.  The format above, which generally considered
       the normal one, is known as the "raw" PGM format.  See pbm(1) for  some
       commentary  on  how plain and raw formats relate to one another and how
       to use them.

       The difference in the plain format is:

       •

              There is exactly one image in a file.

       •

              The magic number is P2 instead of P5.

       •

              Each pixel in the raster is represented as an ASCII decimal num‐
              ber (of arbitrary size).

       •

              Each  pixel  in  the raster has white space before and after it.
              There must be at least one character of white space between  any
              two pixels, but there is no maximum.

       •

              No line should be longer than 70 characters.

       Here is an example of a small image in the plain PGM format.

       P2
       # feep.pgm
       24 7
       15
       0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
       0  3  3  3  3  0  0  7  7  7  7  0  0 11 11 11 11  0  0 15 15 15 15  0
       0  3  0  0  0  0  0  7  0  0  0  0  0 11  0  0  0  0  0 15  0  0 15  0
       0  3  3  3  0  0  0  7  7  7  0  0  0 11 11 11  0  0  0 15 15 15 15  0
       0  3  0  0  0  0  0  7  0  0  0  0  0 11  0  0  0  0  0 15  0  0  0  0
       0  3  0  0  0  0  0  7  7  7  7  0  0 11 11 11 11  0  0 15  0  0  0  0
       0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0

       There is a newline character at the end of each of these lines.

       Programs  that  read  this format should be as lenient as possible, ac‐
       cepting anything that looks remotely like a PGM.

INTERNET MEDIA TYPE
       No Internet Media Type (aka MIME type, content type) for PGM  has  been
       registered with IANA, but the value image/x-portable-graymap is conven‐
       tional.

       Note that the PNM Internet Media Type image/x-portable-anymap also  ap‐
       plies.

FILE NAME
       There are no requirements on the name of a PGM file, but the convention
       is to use the suffix ".pgm".  "pnm" is  also  conventional,  for  cases
       where  distinguishing  between  the particular subformats of PNM is not
       convenient.

COMPATIBILITY
       Before April 2000, a raw format  PGM  file  could  not  have  a  maxval
       greater than 255.  Hence, it could not have more than one byte per sam‐
       ple.  Old programs may depend on this.

       Before July 2000, there could be at most one image in a PGM file.  As a
       result,  most  tools  to  process PGM files ignore (and don't read) any
       data after the first image.
