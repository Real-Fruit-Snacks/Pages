NAME

debian/lintian-brush.conf
- per-package configuration for lintian-brush

DESCRIPTION

A lintian-brush
per-package configuration file that contains of a series of
single key/value pairs. The configuration file should be
placed in the package at
debian/lintian-brush.conf.

The hash sign
&ldquo;#&rdquo; is used as a comment character. Any
text after the comment character to the end of the line is
ignored.

VARIABLES

The following
variables are currently supported:

compat-release
= RELEASE

compat-release
specifies the oldest release that the package aims to be
compatible with. lintian-brush will not make any changes
that require packages or features not present in this
release.

Supported
values are Debian and Ubuntu code names as well as aliases
("testing", "experimental",
"stable", "unstable"). Version numbers
are currently not supported.

The default
compat release is "stable".

allow-reformatting
= True|False

If
allow-reformatting is enabled, lintian-brush will
make changes to debian files in a way that does not
necessarily preserve existing formatting.

If disabled,
lintian-brush will not run any fixers that can not preserve
formatting.

update-changelog
= True|False

The
update-changelog setting determines whether new lines
in the changelog will be added for the changes that
lintian-brush has made to the package.

By default,
lintian-brush will automatically (using some basic
heuristics, such as checking for the presence of a
[dch] section in debian/gbp.conf) determine
whether the changelog should be updated.

You may want to
set this to False if you are using "gbp
dch" to generate your changelog entries.
