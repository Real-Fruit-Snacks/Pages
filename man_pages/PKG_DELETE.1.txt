PKG_DELETE(1) BSD General Commands Manual
PKG_DELETE(1)

NAME

pkg_delete &mdash; a
utility for deleting previously installed software package
distributions

SYNOPSIS

pkg_delete
[&minus;dDfGinrvxX]
[&minus;p prefix] pkg-name ...

pkg_delete &minus;a [flags]

DESCRIPTION

The pkg_delete command is
used to delete packages that have been previously installed
with the pkg_add(1) command.

WARNING

Since the
pkg_delete command may execute scripts or programs
provided by a package file, your system may be susceptible
to &rsquo;&rsquo;trojan horses&rsquo;&rsquo; or other subtle
attacks from miscreants who create dangerous package
files.

You are
advised to verify the competence and identity of those who
provide installable package files. For extra protection,
examine all the package control files in the package record
directory (/var/db/pkg//). Pay particular
attention to any +INSTALL, +POST-INSTALL, +DEINSTALL,
+POST-DEINSTALL, +REQUIRE or +MTREE_DIRS files, and inspect
the +CONTENTS file for @cwd, @mode
(check for setuid), @dirrm,
@exec, and @unexec directives,
and/or use the pkg_info(1) command to examine
the installed package control files.

OPTIONS

The following command line
options are supported:

pkg-name ...

The named packages are
deinstalled.

&minus;a

Unconditionally
delete all currently installed packages.

&minus;i

Request
confirmation before attempting to delete each package,
regardless whether or not the standard input device is a
terminal.

&minus;v

Turn on verbose
output.

&minus;D

If a
deinstallation script exists for a given package, do not
execute it.

&minus;n

Don&rsquo;t
actually deinstall a package, just report the steps that
would be taken if it were.

&minus;p
prefix

Set prefix as the
directory in which to delete files from any installed
packages which do not explicitly set theirs. For most
packages, the prefix will be set automatically to the
installed location by pkg_add(1).

&minus;d

Remove empty
directories created by file cleanup. By default, only
files/directories explicitly listed in a package&rsquo;s
contents (either as normal files/directories or with the
@dirrm directive) will be removed at deinstallation
time. This option tells pkg_delete to also remove any
directories that were emptied as a result of removing the
package.

&minus;f

Force removal
of the package, even if a dependency is recorded or the
deinstall or require script fails.

&minus;G

Do not try to
expand shell glob patterns in the pkg-name when
selecting packages to be deleted (by default
pkg_delete automatically expands shell glob patterns
in the pkg-name).

&minus;x

Treat the
pkg-name as a regular expression and delete all
packages whose names match that regular expression. Multiple
regular expressions could be provided, in that case
pkg_delete deletes all packages that match at least
one regular expression from the list.

&minus;X

Like
&minus;x, but treats the pkg-name as an
extended regular expression.

&minus;r

Recursive
removal. In addition to specified packages, delete all
packages that depend on those packages as well.

TECHNICAL DETAILS

The pkg_delete utility
does pretty much what it says. It examines installed package
records in /var/db/pkg/, deletes the
package contents, and finally removes the package records.
If the environment variable PKG_DBDIR is set, this overrides
the /var/db/pkg/ path shown above.

If a package is
required by other installed packages, pkg_delete will
list those dependent packages and refuse to delete the
package (unless the &minus;f option is given).

If the package
contains a require file (see pkg_create(1)), then
this is executed first as

require
 DEINSTALL

(where pkg-name is the
name of the package in question and DEINSTALL is a
keyword denoting that this is a deinstallation) to see
whether or not deinstallation should continue. A non-zero
exit status means no, unless the &minus;f option is
specified.

If a
deinstall script exists for the package, it is
executed before any files are removed. It is this
script&rsquo;s responsibility to clean up any additional
messy details around the package&rsquo;s installation, since
all pkg_delete knows how to do is delete the files
created in the original distribution. The deinstall
script is called as:

script
 DEINSTALL

where pkg-name is the
name of the package in question and DEINSTALL is a
keyword denoting this as the pre-deinstallation phase.

Note: The
DEINSTALL keyword will not appear if separate scripts
for deinstall and post-deinstall are given during package
creation time (using the &minus;k and &minus;K
flags to pkg_create(1)).

If a
post-deinstall script exists for the package, it is
executed after all files are removed. It is this
script&rsquo;s responsibility to clean up any additional
messy details around the package&rsquo;s installation, and
leave the system (hopefully) in the same state that it was
prior to the installation of the package.

The
post-deinstall script is called as:

script
 POST-DEINSTALL

where pkg-name is the
name of the package in question and POST-DEINSTALL is
a keyword denoting this as the post-deinstallation
phase.

Note: The
POST-DEINSTALL keyword will not appear if separate
scripts for deinstall and post-deinstall are given during
package creation time (using the &minus;k and
&minus;K flags to pkg_create(1)).

Reasoning behind
passing keywords such as DEINSTALL and
POST-DEINSTALL is that it lets you potentially write
only one program/script that handles all aspects of
installation and deletion.

But experience
has proved that this is a lot more difficult to maintain and
is not as advantageous as having separate scripts that
handle each aspect of installation and deinstallation.

All scripts are
called with the environment variable PKG_PREFIX set to the
installation prefix (see the &minus;p option above).
This allows a package author to write a script that reliably
performs some action on the directory where the package is
installed, even if the user might have changed it by
specifying the &minus;p option when running
pkg_delete or pkg_add.

ENVIRONMENT

The environment variable
PKG_DBDIR specifies an alternative location for the
installed package database.

FILES 
/var/db/pkg

Default
location of the installed package database.
