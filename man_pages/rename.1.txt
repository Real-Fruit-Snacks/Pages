NAME

rename &minus;
renames multiple files

SYNOPSIS

rename
[ &minus;v ] [ &minus;n ]
[ &minus;f ] perlexpr
[ files ]

DESCRIPTION

"rename"
renames the filenames supplied according to the rule
specified as the first argument. The perlexpr
argument is a Perl expression which is expected to modify
the $_ string in Perl for at least some of the
filenames specified. If a given filename is not modified by
the expression, it will not be renamed. If no filenames are
given on the command line, filenames will be read via
standard input.

For example, to
rename all files matching "*.bak" to
strip the extension, you might say

        rename &rsquo;s/\.bak$//&rsquo; *.bak

To translate
uppercase names to lower, you&rsquo;d use

        rename &rsquo;y/A-Z/a-z/&rsquo; *

OPTIONS

&minus;v,
&minus;&minus;verbose

Verbose: print names of files
successfully renamed.

&minus;n,
&minus;&minus;no&minus;act

No Action: show what files
would have been renamed.

&minus;f,
&minus;&minus;force

Force: overwrite existing
files.

ENVIRONMENT

No environment
variables are used.

DIAGNOSTICS

If you give an
invalid Perl expression you&rsquo;ll get a syntax error.

BUGS

The original
"rename" did not check for the existence
of target filenames, so had to be used with care. I hope
I&rsquo;ve fixed that (Robin Barker).
