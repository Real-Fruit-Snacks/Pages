NAME

pmSemStr,
pmSemStr_r - convert a performance metric semantic
into a string

C SYNOPSIS

#include

const char
*pmSemStr(int sem); 
char *pmSemStr_r(int sem, char
*buf, int buflen);

cc ...
-lpcp

DESCRIPTION

Given a
performance metric semantic, pmSemStr produces
a terse ASCII equivalent, appropriate for use in error and
diagnostic messages. The pmSemStr_r function does the
same, but stores the result in a user-supplied buffer
buf of length buflen, which should have room
for at least 20 bytes.

The value for
sem is typically extracted from a pmDesc
structure, following a call to pmLookupDesc(3) for a
particular performance metric.

Examples are
counter (for sem equals
PM_SEM_COUNTER), discrete (for sem
equals PM_SEM_DISCRETE), instant (for
sem equals PM_SEM_INSTANT), etc.

NOTES

Both of these
routines are safe to call from threaded applications.
