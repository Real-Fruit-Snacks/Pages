NAME

map-mbone &mdash;
multicast connection mapper

SYNOPSIS

map-mbone
[&minus;d debug_level] [&minus;f]
[&minus;g] [&minus;n]
[&minus;r retry_count]
[&minus;t timeout_count]
[starting_router]

DESCRIPTION

The map-mbone utility
attempts to display all multicast routers that are reachable
from the multicast starting_router. If not specified
on the command line, the default multicast
starting_router is the localhost.

The
map-mbone utility traverses neighboring multicast
routers by sending the ASK_NEIGHBORS IGMP message to the
multicast starting_router. If this multicast router
responds, the version number and a list of their neighboring
multicast router addresses is part of that response. If the
responding router has recent multicast version number, then
map-mbone requests additional information such as
metrics, thresholds, and flags from the multicast router.
For each new occurrence of neighboring multicast router in
the reply and provided the flooding option has been
selected, then map-mbone asks each of this multicast
router for a list of neighbors. This search for unique
routers will continue until no new neighboring multicast
routers are reported.

The following
options are available:

&minus;d

Set the debug
level. When the debug level is greater than the default
value of 0, addition debugging messages are printed.
Regardless of the debug level, an error condition, will
always write an error message and will cause
map-mbone to terminate. Non-zero debug levels have
the following effects:

level 1

packet warnings are printed to
stderr.

level 2

all level 1 messages plus
notifications down networks are printed to stderr.

level 3

all level 2 messages plus
notifications of all packet timeouts are printed to
stderr.

&minus;f

Set flooding
option. Flooding allows the recursive search of neighboring
multicast routers and is enable by default when
starting_router is not used.

&minus;g

Set graphing in
GraphEd format.

&minus;n

Disable the DNS
lookup for the multicast routers names.

&minus;r
retry_count

Set the neighbor query retry
limit. Default is 1 retry.

&minus;t
timeout_count

Set the number of seconds to
wait for a neighbor query reply before retrying. Default
timeout is 2 seconds.

IMPORTANT NOTE

The map-mbone utility
must be run as root.
