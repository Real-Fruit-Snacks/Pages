ISATTY(3POSIX)             POSIX Programmer's Manual            ISATTY(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       isatty — test for a terminal device

SYNOPSIS
       #include <unistd.h>

       int isatty(int fildes);

DESCRIPTION
       The isatty() function shall test whether fildes, an open file  descrip‐
       tor, is associated with a terminal device.

RETURN VALUE
       The  isatty()  function  shall  return 1 if fildes is associated with a
       terminal; otherwise, it shall return 0 and may set  errno  to  indicate
       the error.

ERRORS
       The isatty() function may fail if:

       EBADF  The fildes argument is not a valid open file descriptor.

       ENOTTY The file associated with the fildes argument is not a terminal.

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       The  isatty() function does not necessarily indicate that a human being
       is available for interaction via fildes.  It  is  quite  possible  that
       non-terminal devices are connected to the communications line.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
