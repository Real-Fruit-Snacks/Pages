IMAXDIV(3POSIX)            POSIX Programmer's Manual           IMAXDIV(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       imaxdiv — return quotient and remainder

SYNOPSIS
       #include <inttypes.h>

       imaxdiv_t imaxdiv(intmax_t numer, intmax_t denom);

DESCRIPTION
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with  the
       ISO C  standard.  Any  conflict between the requirements described here
       and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017
       defers to the ISO C standard.

       The imaxdiv() function shall compute numer / denom and numer % denom in
       a single operation.

RETURN VALUE
       The imaxdiv() function shall return a structure of type imaxdiv_t, com‐
       prising  both  the quotient and the remainder. The structure shall con‐
       tain (in either order) the members quot (the quotient) and rem (the re‐
       mainder), each of which has type intmax_t.

       If either part of the result cannot be represented, the behavior is un‐
       defined.

ERRORS
       No errors are defined.
