EUI64(5) BSD File Formats Manual EUI64(5)

NAME

eui64 &mdash; IEEE EUI-64
address database

DESCRIPTION

The eui64 database
contains information regarding known IEEE EUI-64s of hosts.
The data is stored in a file called /etc/eui64 in the
following format:

EUI-64
host-name

Items are
separated by any number of blanks and/or tab characters. A
&rsquo;#&rsquo; at the start of a line indicates the
beginning of a comment that extends to the end of the line.
Valid lines may also contain comments. A &rsquo;+&rsquo; at
the start of a line will cause the eui64(3) library
functions to use data stored in the NIS eui64.byname
and eui64.byid maps in addition to the data in the
/etc/eui64 file.

An EUI-64 is
expressed in ASCII form as "x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x" where
x is a hexadecimal value between 0x00 and 0xFF. The
address values should be in network order. Hostnames
specified in the /etc/eui64 database should
correspond to entries in the hosts(5) file.

FILES 
/etc/eui64

The
eui64 file resides in /etc.
