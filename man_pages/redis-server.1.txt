NAME

redis-server -
Persistent key-value database

SYNOPSIS

redis-server
configfile

DESCRIPTION

Redis is a
key-value database. It is similar to memcached but the
dataset is not volatile and other datatypes (such as lists
and sets) are natively supported.

OPTIONS

configfile

Read options from specified
configuration file.

NOTES

On Debian
GNU/Linux systems, redis-server is typically started
via the /etc/init.d/redis-server initscript, not
manually. This defaults to using
/etc/redis/redis.conf as a configuration file.
