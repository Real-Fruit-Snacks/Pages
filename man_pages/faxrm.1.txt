NAME

faxrm - remove
a Hyla FAX job or document from a
server

SYNOPSIS

faxrm [
-a ] [ -d ] [ -v ] [ -h
hostname ] id...

DESCRIPTION

faxrm
removes one or more jobs or documents from a Hyla
FAX server. If a job that is to be
removed is being processed by a server, it is first
aborted.

An id is
either a number that identifies a job (default) or,
if the -d option is specified, a document pathname.
Job identifiers are printed by sendfax(1) when jobs
are queued for transmission; they can also be displayed with
faxstat(1). The names of documents associated with
outbound jobs can be seen by supplying the -f option
to faxstat. Documents in the receive queue can be
viewed with the -r option to faxstat.

Unprivileged
users can only remove jobs or documents that they own.
Clients with administrative privileges can remove any job or
document (see the -a option below). The user name may
be specified by the FAXUSER environment variable.

OPTIONS

-a

Use administrative privileges;
faxrm will prompt for the password to set
administrative privileges.

-d

Interpret each id as a document pathname. If a
pathname does not begin with &rsquo;&rsquo;/&rsquo;&rsquo;
then faxrm automatically prepends
&rsquo;&rsquo;/docq/&rsquo;&rsquo;. 

-h host

Contact the server at the specified host. The
host may be either a symbolic name or a network
address. If no server is specified then If no -h
option is supplied, faxrm uses the
FAXSERVER environment variable to identify
the Hyla FAX server to contact. If
this variable is not set, then faxrm checks for a
setting in the configuration files (first in the per-user
file and then in the system-wide file). If all of the above
fails, then faxrm attempts to contact a server on the
machine where it is run.

-v

Trace the protocol messages to and from the server.
