NAME

sasl_auxprop_request
- Cyrus SASL documentation

SYNOPSIS

#include

int
sasl_auxprop_request(sasl_conn_t *conn, const char **
propnames)

DESCRIPTION

int
sasl_auxprop_request(sasl_conn_t *conn, const
char **propnames)

sasl_auxprop_request
will request that the SASL library obtain properties from
any auxiliary property plugins that might be installed (such
as the user’s home directory from an LDAP server for
example). Such lookup occurs just after username
canonicalization is complete. Therefore, the request should
be made before the call to sasl_server_start(3), but
after the call to sasl_server_new(3). 
Parameters

•

conn – the sasl_conn_t for which the
request is being made.

•

propnames – a NULL-terminated array of
property names to request. Note that this array must persist
until a call to sasl_dispose(3) on the
sasl_conn_t. 

Returns

Returns SASL_OK on
success. See sasl_errors(3) for meanings of other
return codes.
