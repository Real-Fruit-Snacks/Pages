NAME
       dpkg-fsys-usrunmess - undoes the merged-/usr-via-aliased-dirs mess

SYNOPSIS
       dpkg-fsys-usrunmess [option...]

DESCRIPTION
       dpkg-fsys-usrunmess is a tool to fix up filesystems that have been
       installed anew with recent installers with unfortunate defaults or
       migrated to the broken merged /usr via aliased directories layout,
       which is not supported by dpkg. See the dpkg FAQ.

       Note: In Debian its tech-ctte has decreed that on the release after
       bookworm the non-usrmerged layout is not going to be supported, and
       thus some of its maintainers might not fix issues or intentionally
       remove non-usrmerged support, so you will need decide and pick your
       poison.

       The program will perform the following overall actions:

       •   Check whether the system needs to be switched, otherwise do
           nothing,

       •   Check for dpkg database consistency and otherwise abort.

       •   Generate and install a regression prevention package, if requested
           on the command-line or otherwise on the prompt.

       •   Get the list of files and alternatives that need to be restored.

       •   Look for untracked kernel modules files that need to be moved too.

       •   Create a shadow hierarchy under /.usrunmess, by creating the
           directories symlinks or hardlinking or copying the files as needed.

       •   Prompt for confirmation before proceeding, if requested on the
           command-line.

       •   Lock the dpkg database.

       •   Mark all packages as half-configured to force running maintainer
           scripts that might need to recreate files.

       •   Replace the aliased directories with the shadow ones, by creating a
           backup of the old symlinked directories and renaming the shadow
           ones over.

       •   Relabel MAC information for directories and symlinks if necessary.

       •   Remove backup symlinks.

       •   Remove old moved objects, but defer directory removal.

       •   Remove old deferred directories that are not referenced by dpkg-
           query.

       •   Remove shadow root directory.

       •   Register a policy-rc.d to disallow service actions, which means
           that services might need to be restarted afterwards, ideally via a
           reboot.

       •   Reconfigure all packages.

       •   Unregister the policy-rc.d and restore the alternatives state.

       Note: When running the program from some shells such as bash(1) or
       zsh(1), after executing it, you might need to request the shell to
       forget all remembered executable locations with for example "hash -r".

       Note: Some directories might linger after the migration in case they
       contain untracked files. A list is printed once the script has finished
       for further investigation.

       Warning: Note that this operation has the potential to render the
       system unusable or broken in case of a sudden crash or reboot,
       unexpected state of the system, or possible bugs in the script. Be
       prepared with recovery media and consider doing backups beforehand.

       This program was introduced in dpkg 1.20.6.

OPTIONS
       -p, --prompt
           Prompt at the time of no return, so that the debug output or the
           shadow hierarchy can be evaluated before proceeding.

       --prevention
       --no-prevention
           Enables or disables generating and installing a regression
           prevention package into the system.  If no option has been
           specified, the action to take will be prompted.

           The generated package contains the Protected field set to yes to
           protect against accidental removal of the package.

       -n, --no-act
       --dry-run
           This option enables the dry-run mode, where no destructive action
           takes place, only the preparatory part.

       -?, --help
           Show the usage message and exit.

       --version
           Show the version and exit.

ENVIRONMENT
       DPKG_USRUNMESS_NOACT
           This setting defines whether to enable dry-run mode.
