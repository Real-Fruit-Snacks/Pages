PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       strcspn — get the length of a complementary substring

SYNOPSIS
       #include <string.h>

       size_t strcspn(const char *s1, const char *s2);

DESCRIPTION
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with  the
       ISO C  standard.  Any  conflict between the requirements described here
       and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017
       defers to the ISO C standard.

       The strcspn() function shall compute the length (in bytes) of the maxi‐
       mum initial segment of the string pointed to by s1 which  consists  en‐
       tirely of bytes not from the string pointed to by s2.

RETURN VALUE
       The  strcspn() function shall return the length of the computed segment
       of the string pointed to by s1; no return value is reserved to indicate
       an error.

ERRORS
       No errors are defined.
