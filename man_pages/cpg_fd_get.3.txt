NAME

cpg_fd_get -
Dispatches callbacks from the CPG service

SYNOPSIS

#include

int
cpg_fd_get(cpg_handle_t handle, int
*fd);

DESCRIPTION

The
cpg_fd_get function is used to retrieve the file
descriptor that may be used with the poll system call to
determine when cpg_dispatch(3) won&rsquo;t block. The
handle argument may not be used directly with
poll because it is not the file descriptor, but
instead an internal identifier used by the CPG library.

RETURN VALUE

This call
returns the CS_OK value if successful, otherwise an error is
returned.

ERRORS

The errors are
undocumented.
