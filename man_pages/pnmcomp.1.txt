NAME
       pnmcomp - replaced by pamcomp

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       pnmcomp  was  obsoleted  by  pamcomp(1),  introduced  with Netpbm 10.21
       (March 2004).  pamcomp is backward compatible with pnmcomp,  plus  adds
       many  additional  functions.   Among this is the ability to process PAM
       images, including those with transparency channels.

       pnmcomp remained in the Netpbm package until  Netpbm  10.68  (September
       2014)  because  of hopes that it had fewer bugs than pamcomp because of
       its age.  But now it would just be clutter.

       In Netpbm before 10.21, use the manual for pamcomp with pnmcomp.   Fea‚Äê
       tures  that  are in pamcomp but not pnmcomp are indicated by statements
       that they didn't exist before 10.21.
