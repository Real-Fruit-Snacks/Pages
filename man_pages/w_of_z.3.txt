NAME

w_of_z,
im_w_of_x &minus; Faddeeva&rsquo;s rescaled complex error
function

SYNOPSIS

#include
>

double
_Complex w_of_z ( double _Complex z );

double
im_w_of_x ( double x );

DESCRIPTION

Faddeeva&rsquo;s
rescaled complex error function w(z), also called the plasma
dispersion function.

w_of_z
returns w(z) = exp(&minus;z^2) * erfc(&minus;i*z).

im_w_of_x
returns Im[w(x)].

REFERENCES

To compute
w(z), a combination of two algorithms is used:

For
sufficiently large |z|, a continued-fraction expansion
similar to those described by Gautschi (1970) and Poppe
& Wijers (1990).

Otherwise,
Algorithm 916 by Zaghloul & Ali (2011), which is
generally competitive at small |z|, and more accurate than
the Poppe & Wijers expansion in some regions, e.g. in
the vicinity of z=1+i.

To compute
Im[w(x)], Chebyshev polynomials and continous fractions are
used.
