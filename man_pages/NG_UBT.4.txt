NAME

ng_ubt &mdash; Netgraph
node type that is also a driver for Bluetooth USB
devices

SYNOPSIS

#include 

#include 

DESCRIPTION

The ubt node type is both
a persistent Netgraph node type and a driver for Bluetooth
USB devices. It implements a Bluetooth USB transport layer
as per chapter H2 of the Bluetooth Specification Book v1.1.
A new node is created when a supported USB device is plugged
in.

The node has a
single hook called hook. Incoming bytes received on the
device are re-assembled into HCI frames (according to the
length). Full HCI frames are sent out on the hook. The node
will add a HCI frame indicator if the device did not send
it. HCI frames received on hook are transmitted out. The
node will drop the HCI frame indicator unless the device
requires it to be present.

HARDWARE

The ng_ubt driver
supports all Bluetooth USB devices that conform with the
Bluetooth specification v1.1, including:

&bull;

3Com 3CREB96

&bull;

AIPTEK BR0R02

&bull;

EPoX BT-DG02

&bull;

Mitsumi Bluetooth USB
adapter

&bull;

MSI MS-6967

&bull;

TDK Bluetooth USB adapter

&bull;

Broadcom Bluetooth USB
adapter

HOOKS

This node type supports the
following hooks:

hook

single HCI
frame contained in a single mbuf structure.

CONTROL MESSAGES

This node type supports the
generic control messages, plus the following:

NGM_UBT_NODE_GET_DEBUG
(get_debug)

Returns an integer containing
the current debug level for the node.

NGM_UBT_NODE_SET_DEBUG
(set_debug)

This command takes an integer
argument and sets the current debug level for the node.

NGM_UBT_NODE_GET_QLEN
(get_qlen)

This command takes a parameter
that specifies the queue number and returns the current
maximal length of the queue for the node.

NGM_UBT_NODE_SET_QLEN
(set_qlen)

This command takes two
parameters that specify the queue number and the maximum
length of the queue and sets the maximal length of the queue
for the node.

NGM_UBT_NODE_GET_STAT
(get_stat)

Returns various statistic
information for the node, such as: number of bytes (frames)
sent, number of bytes (frames) received and number of input
(output) errors.

NGM_UBT_NODE_RESET_STAT
(reset_stat)

Reset all statistic counters to
zero.

SHUTDOWN

This node shuts down when the
corresponding USB device is un-plugged.

BUGS

Isochronous USB transfers are
broken. This means that the USB device will not be able to
transfer SCO data (voice). USB interrupt transfers are
implemented as bulk-in transfers (not really a bug).
