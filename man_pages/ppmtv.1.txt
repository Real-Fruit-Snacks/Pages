NAME
       ppmtv - make a PPM image look like taken from an American TV

SYNOPSIS
       ppmtv dimfactor

       [ppmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       ppmtv reads a PPM image as input and dims every other row of image data
       down by the specified dim factor.  This factor may be in the  range  of
       0.0 (the alternate lines are totally black) to 1.0 (original image).

       This creates an effect similar to what I've once seen in the video clip
       'You could be mine' by Guns'n'Roses.  In the scene  I'm  talking  about
       you  can  see  John  Connor on his motorbike, looking up from the water
       trench (?)  he's standing in.  While the camera pulls back,  the  image
       gets  'normal'  by  brightening  up the alternate rows of it. I thought
       this would be an interesting effect to try in MPEG. I did not yet check
       this out, however.  Try for yourself.

OPTIONS
       There  are  no command line options defined specifically for ppmtv, but
       it recognizes the options common to all  programs  based  on  libnetpbm
       (See
        Common Options ⟨index.html#commonoptions⟩ .)
