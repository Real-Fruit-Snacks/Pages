NAME
       Image::ExifTool::InDesign - Read/write meta information in Adobe
       InDesign files

SYNOPSIS
       This module is used by Image::ExifTool

DESCRIPTION
       This module contains routines required by Image::ExifTool to read XMP
       meta information from Adobe InDesign (.IND, .INDD and .INDT) files.

LIMITATIONS
       1) Only XMP meta information is processed.

       2) A new XMP stream may not be created, so XMP tags may only be written
       to InDesign files which previously contained XMP.

       3) File sizes of greater than 2 GB are supported only if the system
       supports them and the LargeFileSupport option is enabled.
