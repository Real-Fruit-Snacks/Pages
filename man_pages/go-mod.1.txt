GO(1)                       General Commands Manual                      GO(1)

NAME
       go-mod - module maintenance

SYNOPSIS
       go mod command [arguments]

DESCRIPTION
       Go mod provides access to operations on modules.

       Note  that  support  for modules is built into all the go commands, not
       just 'go mod'. For example, day-to-day adding, removing, upgrading, and
       downgrading  of  dependencies  should  be done using 'go get'.  See 'go
       help modules' for an overview of module functionality.
