New APIs

blkid: print all attributes of a device known to blkid
(Wanlong Gao) 
e2fsck: access to more features of e2fsck (Wanlong Gao) 
list-md-devices: list of Linux MD devices (Matthew Booth)

md-create: create an MD device 
md-detail: returns metadata for an MD device (Matthew Booth)

md-stop: stop an MD device (Wanlong Gao)

Internals

Git hosting has moved to http://github.com/libguestfs 
The various test directories have been rearranged logically,
and now 
all appear under 'tests/'. 
There is a 'make extra-tests' rule which runs ordinary tests
and 
additional tests, using valgrind to check for memory
problems. 
Multiple memory leaks and other problems found by valgrind
and fixed. 
Support for optional arguments in the generator has been
rewritten 
to provide more features and safety (Matthew Booth). 
With gcc -fvisibility=hidden is used for internal symbols,
avoiding 
call indirection via the PLT. 
RHashtable functions can be tested in the generator. 
ADD_ARG macro in daemon allows arg lists to be constructed
without 
risk of stack smashing. 
Fix generation of OCaml functions that have more than 10
arguments. 
psmisc has been added to the appliance, allowing use of
'fuser', 
'killall' and 'pstree' for debugging. 
bindtests now cover RBufferOut and optional arguments
(Matthew Booth).

fixed 
- 769680 temporary directories created during appliance
builds are not cleaned up on error 
- 761460 guestfs_utimens hangs on named pipes 
- 761451 guestfs_utimens cannot set times on a directory

- 760775 "guestfish: multi-boot operating systems are

- 760000 libguestfs fails to compile with Ruby >= 1.9
