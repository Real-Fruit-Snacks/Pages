SYNOPSIS

dpt
rename-uploader full name old email new email

To be run from
git/packages directory.

DESCRIPTION

dpt
rename-uploader walks over all package directories and
changes any occurrences of author&rsquo;s old email address
in debian/control and debian/copyright with
their new email address. It is handy when an uploader became
a Debian Developer and wants to use their me [AT] debian.org
address.

A suitable
entry is added to debian/changelog, but nothing is
committed.

Repositories
with uncommitted changes are not touched and a warning is
issued.
