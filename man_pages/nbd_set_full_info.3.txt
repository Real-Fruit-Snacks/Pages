NAME

nbd_set_full_info
- control whether NBD_OPT_GO requests extra details

SYNOPSIS

#include

int nbd_set_full_info ( 
struct nbd_handle *h, bool request 
);

DESCRIPTION

By default,
when connecting to an export, libnbd only requests the
details it needs to service data operations. The NBD
protocol says that a server can supply optional information,
such as a canonical name of the export (see
nbd_get_canonical_export_name(3)) or a description of
the export (see nbd_get_export_description(3)), but
that a hint from the client makes it more likely for this
extra information to be provided. This function controls
whether libnbd will provide that hint.

Note that even
when full info is requested, the server is not obligated to
reply with all information that libnbd requested. Similarly,
libnbd will ignore any optional server information that
libnbd has not yet been taught to recognize. Furthermore,
the hint to request block sizes is independently controlled
via nbd_set_request_block_size(3).

RETURN VALUE

If the call is
successful the function returns 0.

ERRORS

On error -1 is
returned.

Refer to
"ERROR HANDLING" in libnbd(3) for how to
get further details of the error.

The following
parameters must not be NULL: "h". For more
information see "Non-NULL parameters" in
libnbd(3).
