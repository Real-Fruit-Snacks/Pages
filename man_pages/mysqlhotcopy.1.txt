NAME

mariadb-hotcopy
- a database backup program (mysqlhotcopy is now a symlink
to mariadb-hotcopy)

SYNOPSIS

mysqlhotcopy
arguments 

DESCRIPTION

mysqlhotcopy
is a Perl script that was originally written and contributed
by Tim Bunce. It uses FLUSH TABLES, LOCK TABLES, and cp or
scp to make a database backup. It is a fast way to make a
backup of the database or single tables, but it can be run
only on the same machine where the database directories are
located. mysqlhotcopy works only for backing up
MyISAM and ARCHIVE tables. It runs on Unix and NetWare.

To use
mysqlhotcopy, you must have read access to the files
for the tables that you are backing up, the SELECT privilege
for those tables, the RELOAD privilege (to be able to
execute FLUSH TABLES), and the LOCK TABLES privilege (to be
able to lock the tables).

shell>
mysqlhotcopy db_name
[/path/to/new_directory]

shell>
mysqlhotcopy db_name_1 ... db_name_n
/path/to/new_directory

Back up tables
in the given database that match a regular expression:

shell>
mysqlhotcopy
db_name./regex/

The regular
expression for the table name can be negated by prefixing it
with a tilde (&ldquo;~&rdquo;):

shell>
mysqlhotcopy
db_name./~regex/

mysqlhotcopy
supports the following options, which can be specified on
the command line or in the [mysqlhotcopy] and [client]
option file groups.

&bull;
--help, -?

Display a help
message and exit.

&bull;
--addtodest

Do not rename
target directory (if it exists); merely add files to it.

&bull;
--allowold

Do not abort if
a target exists; rename it by adding an _old suffix.

&bull;
--checkpoint=db_name.tbl_name

Insert
checkpoint entries into the specified database
db_name and table tbl_name.

&bull;
--chroot=path

Base directory
of the chroot jail in which mysqld operates.
The path value should match that of the
--chroot option given to mysqld.

&bull;
--debug

Enable debug
output.

&bull;
--dryrun, -n

Report actions
without performing them.

&bull;
--flushlog

Flush logs
after all tables are locked.

&bull;
--host=host_name, -h
host_name

The host name
of the local host to use for making a TCP/IP connection to
the local server. By default, the connection is made to
localhost using a Unix socket file.

&bull;
--keepold

Do not delete
previous (renamed) target when done.

&bull;
--method=command

The method for
copying files (cp or scp). The default is cp.

&bull;
--noindices

Do not include
full index files for MyISAM tables in the backup. This makes
the backup smaller and faster. The indexes for reloaded
tables can be reconstructed later with myisamchk
-rq.

&bull;
--old-server

Connect to old
MySQL-server (before v5.5) which doesn&rsquo;t have FLUSH
TABLES WITH READ LOCK fully implemented..

&bull;
--password=password,
-ppassword

The password to
use when connecting to the server. The password value is not
optional for this option, unlike for other MariaDB
programs.

Specifying a
password on the command line should be considered insecure.
You can use an option file to avoid giving the password on
the command line.

&bull;
--port=port_num, -P port_num

The TCP/IP port
number to use when connecting to the local server.

&bull;
--quiet, -q

Be silent
except for errors.

&bull;
--record_log_pos=db_name.tbl_name

Record master
and slave status in the specified database db_name
and table tbl_name.

&bull;
--regexp=expr

Copy all
databases with names that match the given regular
expression.

&bull;
--resetmaster

Reset the
binary log after locking all the tables.

&bull;
--resetslave

Reset the
master.info file after locking all the tables.

&bull;
--socket=path, -S path

The Unix socket
file to use for connections to localhost.

&bull;
--suffix=str

The suffix to
use for names of copied databases.

&bull;
--tmpdir=path

The temporary
directory. The default is /tmp.

&bull;
--user=user_name, -u
user_name

The MariaDB
user name to use when connecting to the server.

additional mysqlhotcopy documentation, including
information about the structure of the tables needed for the
--checkpoint and --record_log_pos options:

shell>
perldoc mysqlhotcopy
