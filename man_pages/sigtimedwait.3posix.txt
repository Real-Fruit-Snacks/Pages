NAME
       sigtimedwait, sigwaitinfo — wait for queued signals

SYNOPSIS
       #include <signal.h>

       int sigtimedwait(const sigset_t *restrict set,
           siginfo_t *restrict info,
           const struct timespec *restrict timeout);
       int sigwaitinfo(const sigset_t *restrict set,
           siginfo_t *restrict info);

DESCRIPTION
       The sigtimedwait() function shall be equivalent to sigwaitinfo() except
       that  if  none  of  the signals specified by set are pending, sigtimed‐
       wait() shall wait for the  time  interval  specified  in  the  timespec
       structure  referenced by timeout.  If the timespec structure pointed to
       by timeout is zero-valued and if none of the signals specified  by  set
       are  pending,  then sigtimedwait() shall return immediately with an er‐
       ror. If timeout is the null pointer, the behavior is  unspecified.   If
       the  Monotonic  Clock  option  is  supported, the CLOCK_MONOTONIC clock
       shall be used to measure the time interval specified by the timeout ar‐
       gument.

       The  sigwaitinfo()  function  selects  the  pending signal from the set
       specified by set.  Should any of multiple pending signals in the  range
       SIGRTMIN  to SIGRTMAX be selected, it shall be the lowest numbered one.
       The selection order between realtime and non-realtime signals,  or  be‐
       tween multiple pending non-realtime signals, is unspecified. If no sig‐
       nal in set is pending at the time of the call, the calling thread shall
       be  suspended  until one or more signals in set become pending or until
       it is interrupted by an unblocked, caught signal.

       The sigwaitinfo() function shall be equivalent to the  sigwait()  func‐
       tion,  except  that the return value and the error reporting method are
       different (see RETURN VALUE), and that if the  info  argument  is  non-
       NULL,  the  selected signal number shall be stored in the si_signo mem‐
       ber, and the cause of the signal shall be stored in the si_code member.
       If  any  value  is queued to the selected signal, the first such queued
       value shall be dequeued and, if the  info  argument  is  non-NULL,  the
       value  shall  be stored in the si_value member of info.  The system re‐
       source used to queue the signal shall be released and returned  to  the
       system  for  other  use.  If  no  value  is  queued, the content of the
       si_value member is undefined. If no further signals are queued for  the
       selected signal, the pending indication for that signal shall be reset.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon  successful  completion  (that is, one of the signals specified by
       set is pending or is generated) sigwaitinfo() and sigtimedwait()  shall
       return the selected signal number. Otherwise, the function shall return
       a value of -1 and set errno to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The sigtimedwait() function shall fail if:

       EAGAIN No signal specified by set was generated  within  the  specified
              timeout period.

       The sigtimedwait() and sigwaitinfo() functions may fail if:

       EINTR  The  wait  was  interrupted  by  an unblocked, caught signal. It
              shall be documented in system documentation whether  this  error
              causes these functions to fail.

       The sigtimedwait() function may also fail if:

       EINVAL The timeout argument specified a tv_nsec value less than zero or
              greater than or equal to 1000 million.

       An implementation should only check for this  error  if  no  signal  is
       pending in set and it is necessary to wait.

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       The  sigtimedwait()  function  times out and returns an [EAGAIN] error.
       Application developers should note that this is inconsistent with other
       functions such as pthread_cond_timedwait() that return [ETIMEDOUT].

       Note that in order to ensure that generated signals are queued and sig‐
       nal values passed to sigqueue() are available in si_value, applications
       which  use  sigwaitinfo()  or sigtimedwait() need to set the SA_SIGINFO
       flag for each signal in the set (see  Section  2.4,  Signal  Concepts).
       This  means  setting each signal to be handled by a three-argument sig‐
       nal-catching function, even if the handler will never be called.  It is
       not  possible  (portably) to set a signal handler to SIG_DFL while set‐
       ting the SA_SIGINFO flag, because assigning to the sa_handler member of
       struct sigaction instead of the sa_sigaction member would result in un‐
       defined behavior, and SIG_DFL need not  be  assignment-compatible  with
       sa_sigaction.   Even if an assignment of SIG_DFL to sa_sigaction is ac‐
       cepted by the compiler, the implementation need not treat this value as
       special—it  could  just  be  taken  as the address of a signal-catching
       function.

RATIONALE
       Existing programming practice on realtime systems uses the  ability  to
       pause  waiting  for a selected set of events and handle the first event
       that occurs in-line instead of in a signal-handling function. This  al‐
       lows applications to be written in an event-directed style similar to a
       state machine. This style  of  programming  is  useful  for  largescale
       transaction  processing  in which the overall throughput of an applica‐
       tion and the ability to clearly track states are  more  important  than
       the ability to minimize the response time of individual event handling.

       It  is possible to construct a signal-waiting macro function out of the
       realtime  signal  function  mechanism  defined  in   this   volume   of
       POSIX.1‐2017.  However, such a macro has to include the definition of a
       generalized handler for all signals to be waited on. A significant por‐
       tion  of  the overhead of handler processing can be avoided if the sig‐
       nal-waiting  function  is  provided  by  the  kernel.  This  volume  of
       POSIX.1‐2017  therefore  provides two signal-waiting functions—one that
       waits indefinitely and one with a timeout—as part of the overall  real‐
       time signal function specification.

       The specification of a function with a timeout allows an application to
       be written that can be broken out of a wait after a set period of  time
       if  no event has occurred. It was argued that setting a timer event be‐
       fore the wait and recognizing the timer event in the  wait  would  also
       implement the same functionality, but at a lower performance level. Be‐
       cause of the performance degradation  associated  with  the  user-level
       specification  of a timer event and the subsequent cancellation of that
       timer event after the wait completes for a valid event,  and  the  com‐
       plexity  associated  with handling potential race conditions associated
       with the user-level method, the separate function has been included.

       Note that the semantics of the sigwaitinfo() function are nearly  iden‐
       tical  to  that  of  the  sigwait()  function defined by this volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017. The only difference is  that  sigwaitinfo()  returns  the
       queued  signal  value  in  the value argument. The return of the queued
       value is required so that applications can differentiate between multi‐
       ple events queued to the same signal number.

       The  two distinct functions are being maintained because some implemen‐
       tations may choose to implement the POSIX Threads  Extension  functions
       and  not  implement  the  queued signals extensions. Note, though, that
       sigwaitinfo() does not return the queued value if the value argument is
       NULL,  so  the POSIX Threads Extension sigwait() function can be imple‐
       mented as a macro on sigwaitinfo().

       The sigtimedwait() function was separated from the sigwaitinfo()  func‐
       tion  to  address  concerns  regarding  the  overloading of the timeout
       pointer to indicate indefinite wait (no timeout), timed wait, and imme‐
       diate  return,  and concerns regarding consistency with other functions
       where the conditional and timed waits were separate functions from  the
       pure  blocking  function. The semantics of sigtimedwait() are specified
       such that sigwaitinfo() could be implemented as a  macro  with  a  null
       pointer for timeout.

       The  sigwait  functions  provide a synchronous mechanism for threads to
       wait for asynchronously-generated signals. One important  question  was
       how  many  threads that are suspended in a call to a sigwait() function
       for a signal should return from the call when the signal is sent.  Four
       choices were considered:

        1. Return  an  error  for multiple simultaneous calls to sigwait func‐
           tions for the same signal.

        2. One or more threads return.

        3. All waiting threads return.

        4. Exactly one thread returns.

       Prohibiting multiple calls to sigwait() for the same signal was felt to
       be overly restrictive. The ``one or more'' behavior made implementation
       of conforming packages easy at the expense  of  forcing  POSIX  threads
       clients  to protect against multiple simultaneous calls to sigwait() in
       application code in order to achieve predictable  behavior.  There  was
       concern  that  the  ``all  waiting  threads''  behavior would result in
       ``signal broadcast  storms'',  consuming  excessive  CPU  resources  by
       replicating the signals in the general case. Furthermore, no convincing
       examples could be presented that delivery to all was either simpler  or
       more powerful than delivery to one.

       Thus, the consensus was that exactly one thread that was suspended in a
       call to a sigwait function for a signal should return when that  signal
       occurs. This is not an onerous restriction as:

        *  A multi-way signal wait can be built from the single-way wait.

        *  Signals  should  only  be handled by application-level code, as li‐
           brary routines cannot guess what the application wants to  do  with
           signals generated for the entire process.

        *  Applications  can  thus arrange for a single thread to wait for any
           given signal and call any needed routines upon its arrival.

       In an application that is using signals for interprocess communication,
       signal processing is typically done in one place. Alternatively, if the
       signal is being caught so that process cleanup can be done, the  signal
       handler thread can call separate process cleanup routines for each por‐
       tion of the application. Since the application main line  started  each
       portion  of  the  application,  it is at the right abstraction level to
       tell each portion of the application to clean up.

       Certainly, there exist programming styles where it is logical  to  con‐
       sider  waiting  for  a single signal in multiple threads. A simple sig‐
       wait_multiple() routine can be constructed to achieve this goal. A pos‐
       sible  implementation  would  be to have each sigwait_multiple() caller
       registered as having expressed interest  in  a  set  of  signals.   The
       caller  then  waits  on  a thread-specific condition variable. A single
       server thread calls a sigwait() function on the union of all registered
       signals.  When the sigwait() function returns, the appropriate state is
       set and condition variables are broadcast. New sigwait_multiple() call‐
       ers may cause the pending sigwait() call to be canceled and reissued in
       order to update the set of signals being waited for.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
