NAME

qmail-users -
assign mail addresses to users

OVERVIEW

The file
/var/lib/qmail/users/assign assigns addresses to
users. For example,

   =joe.shmoe:joe:503:78:/home/joe:::

says that mail
for joe.shmoe should be delivered to user joe,
with uid 503 and gid 78, as specified by
/home/joe/.qmail.

Assignments fed
to qmail-newu will be used by qmail-lspawn to
control qmail-local&rsquo;s deliveries. See
qmail-newu(8). A change to
/var/lib/qmail/users/assign will have no effect until
qmail-newu is run.

STRUCTURE

/var/lib/qmail/users/assign
is a series of assignments, one per line. It ends with a
line containing a single dot. Lines must not contain
NUL.

SIMPLE ASSIGNMENTS

A simple
assignment is a line of the form

   =local:user:uid:gid:homedir:dash:ext:

Here
local is an address; user, uid, and
gid are the account name, uid, and gid of the user in
charge of local; and messages to local will be
controlled by
homedir/.qmaildashext.

If there are
several assignments for the same local address,
qmail-lspawn will use the first one.

local is
interpreted without regard to case.

WILDCARD ASSIGNMENTS

A wildcard
assignment is a line of the form

   +loc:user:uid:gid:homedir:dash:pre:

This assignment
applies to any address beginning with loc, including
loc itself. It means the same as

   =locext:user:uid:gid:homedir:dash:preext:

for every
string ext.

A more specific
wildcard assignment overrides a less specific assignment,
and a simple assignment overrides any wildcard assignment.
For example:

   +:alias:7790:2108:/var/lib/qmail/alias:-::
   +joe-:joe:507:100:/home/joe:-::
   =joe:joe:507:100:/home/joe:::

The address
joe is handled by the third line; the address
joe-direct is handled by the second line; the address
bill is handled by the first line.
