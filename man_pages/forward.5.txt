FORWARD(5) BSD File Formats Manual FORWARD(5)

NAME

forward &mdash; email
forwarding information file

DESCRIPTION

Users may put a .forward
file in their home directory. If this file exists, smtpd(8)
forwards email to the destinations specified therein.

A
.forward file contains a list of expansion values, as
described in aliases(5). Each expansion value should be on a
line by itself. However, the .forward mechanism
differs from the aliases mechanism in that it disallows file
inclusion (:include:) and it performs expansion under the
user ID of the .forward file owner.

Permissions on
the .forward file are very strict and expansion is
rejected if the file is group or world-writable; if the home
directory is group writeable; or if the file is not owned by
the user.

Users should
avoid editing the .forward file directly, to prevent
delivery failures from occurring if a message arrives while
the file is not fully written. The best option is to use a
temporary file and use the mv(1) command to atomically
overwrite the former .forward. Alternatively, setting
the sticky(8) bit on the home directory will cause the
.forward lookup to return a temporary failure,
causing mails to be deferred.

FILES 
~/.forward

Email
forwarding information.

EXAMPLES

The following file forwards mail
to &ldquo;user [AT] example.com&rdquo;, and pipes the same mail
to &ldquo;examplemda&rdquo;.

# empty lines
are ignored

user [AT] example.com

# anything after # is ignored

"|/path/to/examplemda"
