NAME

atmaddr - list
and maintain local ATM addresses

SYNOPSIS

atmaddr
[-n] [itf] 
atmaddr -r [itf] 
atmaddr -a [itf] atm_addr 
atmaddr -d [itf] atm_addr 
atmaddr -V

DESCRIPTION

atmaddr
is used to list the local addresses configured for ATM
interfaces and to manually change the list of addresses. If
the interface number itf is omitted, interface 0 is
used by default. The ATM address atm_addr can be any
valid ATM SVC address, e.g. an E.164 address or an ATM Forum
NSAP address.

If invoked
without options, atmaddr lists the addresses that are
currently configured on the specified interface.

Note that local
ATM addresses are normally automatically maintained by the
ILMI demon.

OPTIONS

-a

append the specified address at
the end of the list.

-d

delete the specified address from the list.

-n

numeric address output only. No address to name
translation is attempted.

-r

reset (clear) the local address list of the specified
interface. 

-V

print the version number of atmaddr on standard
output and exit.
