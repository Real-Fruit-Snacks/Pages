[itf.]vpi.vci
[qos qos]
[sndbuf bytes] [temp] [pub]
[null]

[arpsrv] 
atmarp -d ip_addr [arpsrv] 
atmarp -V

DESCRIPTION

atmarp
is used to maintain the ATMARP table of the ATMARP demon.
The table can be listed, new PVC and SVC entries can be
added, and existing entries can be deleted. In addition to
that, atmarp is also used to create new IP over ATM
interfaces.

Note that the
kernel has its own ATMARP table containing only entries for
destinations to which a connection exists. The table of
atmarpd can also contain currently unused
entries.

OPTIONS

-a

list the current ATMARP
table. 

-c

create the specified IP interface. If the interface
number is omitted, the operating system assigns the next
free number and atmarp prints the resulting interface
name (e.g. ’atm0’) on standard output.

-q

sets the QOS and the send buffer size to use as the
default for all VCs generated for that IP network
(ip_addr must be the address of the network).

-s

set up a PVC or create an SVC entry. The following
options are recognized:

qos qos

uses the specified quality of
service (see qos(7) for the syntax). UBR at link speed is
used by default.

sndbuf bytes

tries to set the send buffer to
the specified number of bytes. A system default value is
used if sndbuf is not specified.

temp

does not mark the entry as permanent, i.e. it will time
out and then be removed.

pub

publishes the entry (only relevant for ATMARP server).
ATMARP requests for entries not marked for publishing yield
an ATMARP_NAK response.

null

uses NULL encapsulation instead of LLC/SNAP
encapsulation on the PVC. This option is not available for
SVCs, because the LLC/SNAP header is required to identify
ATMARP packets. null also implies that the entry is
permanent. 

arpsrv

identifies the entry pointing to the ATMARP server. Note
that the node acting as the ATMARP server must have no
ATMARP server entry in its ATMARP table.

-d

delete the
specified ARP entry. In order to prevent accidental deletion
of the ATMARP server entry, the arpsrv flag must be
specified when deleting it.

-V

print the version number of
atmarp on standard output and exit.
