NAME
       Font::TTF::Delta - Opentype Device tables

DESCRIPTION
       Each device table corresponds to a set of deltas for a particular point
       over a range of ppem values.

       first
           The first ppem value in the range

       last
           The last ppem value in the range

       val This is an array of deltas corresponding to each ppem in the range
           between first and last inclusive.

       fmt This is the fmt used (log2 of number bits per value) when the
           device table was read. It is recalculated on output.

   out($fh, $style)
       Outputs a device table to the given IO object at the current location,
       or just returns the data to be output if $style != 0

   $d->signature()
       Returns a content based identifying string for this delta for
       compression purposes
