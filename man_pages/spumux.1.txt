NAME
       spumux  -  generates  and  multiplexes subtitles into an existing mpeg2
       program stream

SYNOPSIS
       spumux [ -m dvd | -m cvd | -m svcd ] [ -s stream ] [ -v level ] [ -P  ]
       [ --nomux ] [ --nodvdauthor-data ] file < mpeg > mpeg-with-subtitles

DESCRIPTION
       spumux  encodes the subtitles and multiplexes it into the mpeg2 program
       stream.

       -m mode
              Sets the encoding for the subtitles.  Can be dvd, cvd, or  svcd.
              Default is dvd.

       -s stream
              Sets the subtitle stream id.  Default is 0.

       -v level
              Sets the verbosity level.

       -P     Enables a progress bar.

       --nomux
              Disables reading of an MPEG stream from standard input. Instead,
              the output will contain only the subpicture stream.

       --nodvdauthor-data
              Disables passing of color and button info to dvdauthor.

       Here's a sample configuration file:

       <subpictures>
          <stream>
             <spu start="start-time" [ end="end-time" ] [ image="picture.png" ]
                  [ highlight="picture.png" ] [ select="picture.png" ]
                  [ transparent="color-spec" ] [ force="yes" ]
                  [ autooutline="infer" [ outlinewidth="width" ]
                    [ autoorder="rows" | autoorder="columns" ] ]
                  [ xoffset="x-coord" yoffset="y-coord" ] >
                <button [ name="name" ] [ x0="x0" ] [ y0="y0" ] [ x1="x1" ]
                        [ y1="y1" ] [ up="name" ] [ down="name" ]
                        [ left="name" ] [ right="name" ] />
                <action [ name="name" ] [ x0="x0" ] [ y0="y0" ] [ x1="x1" ]
                        [ y1="y1" ] />
             </spu>
          </stream>
       </subpictures>

       Each subtitle image is described by an <spu> tag.  The  start  and  op‐
       tional  end  attributes describe when the subtitle will be displayed on
       the screen, in "HR:MM:SS.HU".  The image attribute describes  the  main
       subtitle  image,  which can either be a PNG or BMP file.  If your image
       is not a full screen image, you can use xoffset and yoffset to move the
       picture  around.   In  the  advent  that  the author is unable to use a
       graphics format with an alpha channel, then the  transparent  attribute
       can  be  used  to describe which color should become fully transparent.
       For the valid formats for color-spec, see SPECIFYING COLORS below.   If
       you  want  to  force the display of the subtitle, regardless of whether
       the user has enabled subtitles or not, you can use the force tag.  When
       you are making menus, the force tag is required.

       The  remaining  attributes  and tags are related to menu creation.  The
       highlight attribute shows what all the buttons look like when they  are
       highlighted  (i.e.  when you are using the arrows in the menu), and the
       select attribute shows what all the buttons look like when the are  se‐
       lected  (i.e.  for  the 1-2 seconds after you press enter in the menu).
       If either of these (or the image attribute) are  omitted,  then  spumux
       creates  a  blank  (totally transparent) image.  Obviously at least one
       tag should be specified.

       To aid in button creation, the autooutline attribute  instructs  spumux
       to  infer where the buttons are located.  It does this by attempting to
       draw rectangles around a composition of the highlight and select images
       which  do  not intersect any opaque or semi-opaque pixels.  In order to
       support textual buttons, the attribute outlinewidth allows you to spec‐
       ify the width of the rectangle which is tested.  Wider rectangles won't
       be able to squeeze between the letters.  Finally,  autoorder  describes
       which  way to order the automatically detected buttons, which is impor‐
       tant for numerically selected buttons and for mapping buttons to button
       names or to the implied names.

       The button and action tags describe the buttons (visibly selectable ob‐
       jects on the screen) and actions (commands that are executed as soon as
       the associated key is pressed on the remote).  If you are using the au‐
       tooutline feature, just designing buttons, are happy with the  inferred
       button navigation, and can deal with the simplistic naming system, then
       you actually do not even need to specify any buttons or actions.   Oth‐
       erwise, read on.

       The  name attribute is used to give a button or action an easy to refer
       to name.  By default they are numbered sequentially starting with  "1".
       The  up,  down,  left,  and right names describe which button or action
       should be tied to the corresponding key  when  the  current  button  is
       highlighted, though if omitted spumux will use a reasonably intelligent
       algorithm to determine which buttons to move to.

       The (x0,y0) coordinates describe the  upper  left  hand  corner  inclu‐
       sively,  while  the  (x1,y1)  coordinates describe the lower right hand
       corner EXclusively.  The coordinates start at 0,0 for  the  upper  left
       hand  corner.   Ideally, the y0 and y1 coordinates should both be even,
       so the button edges fully empasses two interlaced  scanlines,  even  if
       there  is no data in the extra scanline.  Some DVD players will fill in
       the extra scanline if it is not specified; spumux makes  an  effort  to
       ensure that will be transparent but there is no guarantee.

HANDLING TEXT-BASED SUBTITLES
       Spumux is also able to handle text subtitles, which will be rendered to
       graphics by spumux. A lot of different text (must be non-graphic)  for‐
       mats  are  supported  (.sub,  .srt, .ssa, .smi, .rt , .txt, .aqt, .jss,
       .js, ass).  Spumux will try to determine the format automatically.

       If processing text-based subtitles no other  streams  can  be  defined,
       buttons or others need to be processed in another pass with spumux, us‐
       ing another xml file.

       Following .xml file shows the available tags  and  their  default  set‐
       tings.   Only  the  textsub  tag is mandatory, defaults are used if the
       specific tag is not specified.

       <subpictures [format="NTSC|PAL"]>
          <stream>
             <textsub filename="demo1.srt" characterset="UTF-8"
                fontsize="28.0" font="arial" fill-color="color-spec"
                outline-color="color-spec" outline-thickness="3.0"
                shadow-offset="0, 0" shadow-color="color-spec"
                horizontal-alignment="left"  vertical-alignment="bottom"
                left-margin="60" right-margin="60"
                top-margin="20" bottom-margin="30" subtitle-fps="fps"
                movie-fps="fps"
                movie-width="720" movie-height="height" aspect="4:3"
                force="yes"
             />
          </stream>
       </subpictures>

       The textsub tag defines the settings for the text to  graphics  render‐
       ing.

       The filename attribute defines the path and name of the input text sub‐
       title file, this is the only attribute that is mandatory.

       The characterset attribute defines the characterset to be used,  avail‐
       able  charactersets  can  be found at http://www.gnu.org/software/libi‐
       conv.

       The fontsize attribute defines the size of the font in font units.  The
       font  attribute  defines the font used. Spumux will match the font name
       using Fontconfig if available, else it will use it  as  a  filename  on
       linux  systems  and  will  look into the windows/fonts and subdirectory
       spumux of the cygwin/mingw home directory and into the execution direc‐
       tory  for  windows-based  execution for the specified font. Looking for
       free  fonts?  One  listing  is  here  http://www.microsoft.com/typogra‐
       phy/links/links.asp?type=free&part=1  (this  is  only  about fonts, not
       about operating systems).

       The fill-color attribute specifies the color to be used for filling the
       interior  of  the text, while outline-color specifies the color for the
       outline border to draw around each character, to set it  off  from  the
       video background.  The outline-thickness attribute specifies the thick‐
       ness of this outline. For the valid formats for color-spec, see  SPECI‐
       FYING  COLORS  below.   The default fill color is white and the default
       outline color is black.

       The shadow-offset and shadow-color attributes specify a  shadow  effect
       to  be  applied to the text. The shadow-offset is specified as 2 signed
       integers, being the horizontal and vertical offset  respectively,  with
       positive  values being to the right and down. For the valid formats for
       color-spec, see SPECIFYING COLORS below.  The default shadow  color  is
       black.

       The  horizontal-alignment attribute defines the horizontal alignment of
       the subtitles. Options are: "left", "right",  "center"  and  "default".
       The  "default"  value causes spumux to use the attribute that is in the
       text subtitle file if the format supports such an attribute.

       The vertical-alignment attribute defines the vertical  alignment.   Op‐
       tions are: "top", "center" and "bottom".

       The  margin attributes define the minimum blank pixel space between the
       border of the image and the border of the subtitle lines.

       The subtitle-fps is needed for subtitle formats which use frame numbers
       rather than fractional seconds for specifying subtitle times, while the
       movie-fps is the frame rate of the movie onto which the  subtitles  are
       being  multiplexed; if omitted, both of these default to 29.97 for NTSC
       and 25 for PAL.

       Having separate subtitle-fps and movie-fps attributes make it  possible
       for  spumux  to  recalculate  the  subtitle timing if these are not the
       same.

       The movie-width and movie-height attributes define the maximum size  of
       the subtitle page, these shouldn't be larger than the size of the video
       frame (720x480 for NTSC, 720x576 for PAL), normally they are the  same.
       Some  DVD players prefer subtitle frames that are 2 or 4 pixels smaller
       in height.  If omitted, the default movie width is 720 and  the  height
       is 2 pixels less than the video frame height.

       The aspect attribute lets you specify whether the video aspect ratio is
       16:9 (widescreen) or 4:3. This, together with the video format, is used
       to adjust the rendering of the text to ensure it appears undistorted.

       The  force  option allows you to force the display of the subtitle, re‐
       gardless of whether the user has enabled subtitles or not.

SPECIFYING COLORS
       Colors for image transparency and text fill and outlines can be  speci‐
       fied in a number of ways:

       • As  a  color  name, e.g. "green". You can use most of the color names
         listed at <http://www.imagemagick.org/script/color.php>.

       • As a hexadecimal string preceded by a "#", similar  to  HTML  format,
         e.g.  "#FF8080".  The  number  of digits must be a multiple of 3; the
         first group specifies the red component, the second  green,  and  the
         third blue.

       • As  the name of a color space, followed by one to four component val‐
         ues in parentheses, e.g. "hsv(120, 50%, 90%)".

       Valid color spaces are "gray" (1 component),  "graya"  (2  components),
       "hsl"  (3  components),  "hsla"  (4  components), "hsv" (3 components),
       "hsva" (4 components), "rgb" (3 components) and "rgba" (4  components).
       Each  component  can be specified as either a percentage of the maximum
       value suffixed by "%", or an absolute value  in  the  range  0-360  for
       hues, 0-255 for everything else. For color space names ending with "a",
       the last component is the alpha (transparency) value.

       Note that alpha values are meaningless for the "transparent"  attribute
       on  the  <spu>  tag  above.  <marc.leeman@gmail.com> MarcLeeman2003Marc
