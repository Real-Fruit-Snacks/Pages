NAME
       pthread_join — wait for thread termination

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pthread.h>

       int pthread_join(pthread_t thread, void **value_ptr);

DESCRIPTION
       The pthread_join() function shall  suspend  execution  of  the  calling
       thread until the target thread terminates, unless the target thread has
       already terminated. On return from  a  successful  pthread_join()  call
       with  a non-NULL value_ptr argument, the value passed to pthread_exit()
       by the terminating thread shall be made available in the location  ref‐
       erenced  by value_ptr.  When a pthread_join() returns successfully, the
       target thread has been terminated. The results of multiple simultaneous
       calls  to  pthread_join()  specifying  the same target thread are unde‐
       fined. If the thread calling pthread_join() is canceled, then the  tar‐
       get thread shall not be detached.

       It is unspecified whether a thread that has exited but remains unjoined
       counts against {PTHREAD_THREADS_MAX}.

       The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the thread argument
       to pthread_join() does not refer to a joinable thread.

       The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the thread argument
       to pthread_join() refers to the calling thread.

RETURN VALUE
       If successful, the pthread_join() function shall  return  zero;  other‐
       wise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The pthread_join() function may fail if:

       EDEADLK
              A deadlock was detected.

       The pthread_join() function shall not return an error code of [EINTR].

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       An example of thread creation and deletion follows:

           typedef struct {
               int *ar;
               long n;
           } subarray;

           void *
           incer(void *arg)
           {
               long i;

               for (i = 0; i < ((subarray *)arg)->n; i++)
                   ((subarray *)arg)->ar[i]++;
           }

           int main(void)
           {
               int        ar[1000000];
               pthread_t  th1, th2;
               subarray   sb1, sb2;

               sb1.ar = &ar[0];
               sb1.n  = 500000;
               (void) pthread_create(&th1, NULL, incer, &sb1);

               sb2.ar = &ar[500000];
               sb2.n  = 500000;
               (void) pthread_create(&th2, NULL, incer, &sb2);

               (void) pthread_join(th1, NULL);
               (void) pthread_join(th2, NULL);
               return 0;
           }

APPLICATION USAGE
       None.

RATIONALE
       The  pthread_join() function is a convenience that has proven useful in
       multi-threaded applications. It is true that a programmer  could  simu‐
       late  this  function  if it were not provided by passing extra state as
       part of the argument to the start_routine().   The  terminating  thread
       would set a flag to indicate termination and broadcast a condition that
       is part of that state; a joining thread would wait  on  that  condition
       variable.  While  such a technique would allow a thread to wait on more
       complex conditions (for example, waiting for multiple threads to termi‐
       nate),  waiting  on  individual thread termination is considered widely
       useful. Also, including the pthread_join() function in no way precludes
       a  programmer  from coding such complex waits. Thus, while not a primi‐
       tive, including pthread_join() in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 was  con‐
       sidered valuable.

       The pthread_join() function provides a simple mechanism allowing an ap‐
       plication to wait for a thread to terminate. After  the  thread  termi‐
       nates,  the application may then choose to clean up resources that were
       used by the thread. For instance, after pthread_join() returns, any ap‐
       plication-provided stack storage could be reclaimed.

       The  pthread_join()  or  pthread_detach() function should eventually be
       called for every thread that is created with the detachstate  attribute
       set  to  PTHREAD_CREATE_JOINABLE  so  that  storage associated with the
       thread may be reclaimed.

       The interaction between pthread_join() and cancellation is well-defined
       for the following reasons:

        *  The  pthread_join()  function, like all other non-async-cancel-safe
           functions, can only be called with deferred cancelability type.

        *  Cancellation cannot occur in the disabled cancelability state.

       Thus, only the default cancelability state need be considered. As spec‐
       ified,  either the pthread_join() call is canceled, or it succeeds, but
       not both. The difference is obvious to the application, since either  a
       cancellation  handler  is  run  or pthread_join() returns. There are no
       race conditions since pthread_join() was called in the deferred  cance‐
       lability state.

       If an implementation detects that the value specified by the thread ar‐
       gument to pthread_join() does not refer to a  joinable  thread,  it  is
       recommended that the function should fail and report an [EINVAL] error.

       If an implementation detects that the value specified by the thread ar‐
       gument to pthread_join() refers to the calling  thread,  it  is  recom‐
       mended that the function should fail and report an [EDEADLK] error.

       If  an  implementation  detects use of a thread ID after the end of its
       lifetime, it is recommended that the function should fail and report an
       [ESRCH] error.

       None.
