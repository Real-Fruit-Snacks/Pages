BHND(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual BHND(4)

NAME

bhnd &mdash; Broadcom
Home Networking Division interconnect bus

SYNOPSIS

To compile this driver into the
kernel, add the following lines to the kernel configuration
file:

device
bhnd

To load the
driver as a module at boot, add this line to
loader.conf(5):

bhnd_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION

The bhnd driver provides
a unified kernel bus interface to the on-chip interconnects
used in Broadcom Home Networking Division (HND) devices.

The Broadcom HND
device family consists of SoCs (System On a Chip) and
host-connected chipsets based on a common library of
Broadcom IP cores connected via an internal hardware bus
architecture. Drivers for these cores are implemented
against the unified bhnd interface.

The Sonic Inc.
Silicon Backplane used in earlier HND devices is supported
by the siba(4) BHND driver.

The ARM
AMBA-based interconnect used in later HND devices is
supported by the bcma(4) BHND driver.

HISTORY

The bhnd device driver
first appeared in FreeBSD 11.0.
