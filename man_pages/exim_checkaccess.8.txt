EXIM_CHECKACCESS(8)         System Manager's Manual        EXIM_CHECKACCESS(8)

NAME
       exim_checkaccess - Check address acceptance from given IP

SYNOPSIS
       exim_checkaccess IP-address email@address [more Exim options]

DESCRIPTION
       Exim's  -bh command line argument allows you to run a fake SMTP session
       with debugging output, in order to check what Exim is doing when it  is
       applying policy controls to incoming SMTP mail.  However, not everybody
       is sufficiently familiar with the SMTP protocol to be able to make full
       use  of  -bh,  and sometimes you just want to answer the question “Does
       this address have access?” without bothering with any further details.

       The exim_checkaccess utility is a ‘packaged’ version of -bh.  It  takes
       two arguments, an IP address and an email address:

         exim_checkaccess 10.9.8.7 A.User@a.domain.example

       The  utility  runs  a call to Exim with the -bh option, to test whether
       the given email address would be accepted in a RCPT command in a TCP/IP
       connection  from the host with the given IP address.  The output of the
       utility is either the word ‘accepted’, or the SMTP error response,  for
       example:

         Rejected:
           550 Relay not permitted

       When  running  this  test, the utility uses “<>” as the envelope sender
       address for the MAIL command, but you can change this by providing  ad‐
       ditional  options.  These are passed directly to the Exim command.  For
       example, to specify that the test is to be run with the sender  address
       “himself@there.example” you can use:

         exim_checkaccess 10.9.8.7 A.User@a.domain.example \
                          -f himself@there.example

       Note  that these additional Exim command line items must be given after
       the two mandatory arguments.

BUGS
       This manual page needs a major re-work. If somebody knows better  groff
       than  us  and  has more experience in writing manual pages, any patches
       would be greatly appreciated.
