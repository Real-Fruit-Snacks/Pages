CHRONIC(1)                                                          CHRONIC(1)

NAME
       chronic - runs a command quietly unless it fails

SYNOPSIS
       chronic [-ev] COMMAND...

DESCRIPTION
       chronic runs a command, and arranges for its standard out and standard
       error to only be displayed if the command fails (exits nonzero or
       crashes).  If the command succeeds, any extraneous output will be
       hidden.

       A common use for chronic is for running a cron job. Rather than trying
       to keep the command quiet, and having to deal with mails containing
       accidental output when it succeeds, and not verbose enough output when
       it fails, you can just run it verbosely always, and use chronic to hide
       the successful output.

               0    1 * * * chronic backup # instead of backup >/dev/null 2>&1
               */20 * * * * chronic -ve my_script # verbose for debugging

OPTIONS
       -v  Verbose output (distinguishes between STDOUT and STDERR, also
           reports RETVAL)

       -e  Stderr triggering. Triggers output when stderr output length is
           non-zero.  Without -e chronic needs non-zero return value to
           trigger output.

           In this mode, chronic's return value will be 2 if the command's
           return value is 0 but the command printed to stderr.
