HTONL(3POSIX)              POSIX Programmer's Manual             HTONL(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       htonl, htons, ntohl, ntohs — convert values between  host  and  network
       byte order

SYNOPSIS
       #include <arpa/inet.h>

       uint32_t htonl(uint32_t hostlong);
       uint16_t htons(uint16_t hostshort);
       uint32_t ntohl(uint32_t netlong);
       uint16_t ntohs(uint16_t netshort);

DESCRIPTION
       These functions shall convert 16-bit and 32-bit quantities between net‐
       work byte order and host byte order.

       On some implementations, these functions are defined as macros.

       The uint32_t and uint16_t types are defined in <inttypes.h>.

RETURN VALUE
       The htonl() and htons() functions shall return the argument value  con‐
       verted from host to network byte order.

       The  ntohl() and ntohs() functions shall return the argument value con‐
       verted from network to host byte order.

ERRORS
       No errors are defined.

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       These functions are most often used in conjunction with IPv4  addresses
       and ports as returned by gethostent() and getservent().

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
