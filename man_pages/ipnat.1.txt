NAME

ipnat &minus;
user interface to the NAT

SYNOPSIS

ipnat [
&minus;lnrsvCF ] &minus;f
filename>

DESCRIPTION

ipnat
opens the filename given (treating "&minus;" as
stdin) and parses the file for a set of rules which are to
be added or removed from the IP NAT.

Each rule
processed by ipnat is added to the kernels internal
lists if there are no parsing problems. Rules are added to
the end of the internal lists, matching the order in which
they appear when given to ipnat.

OPTIONS

&minus;C

delete all entries in the
current NAT rule listing (NAT rules)

&minus;F

delete all active entries in the current NAT translation
table (currently active NAT mappings)

&minus;l

Show the list of current NAT table entry mappings.

&minus;n

This flag (no-change) prevents ipf from actually
making any ioctl calls or doing anything which would alter
the currently running kernel.

&minus;s

Retrieve and display NAT statistics

&minus;r

Remove matching NAT rules rather than add them to the
internal lists

&minus;v

Turn verbose mode on. Displays information relating to
rule processing and active rules/table entries.
