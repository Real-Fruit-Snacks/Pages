NAME
       sane-teco2 - SANE backend for TECO / RELISYS scanners

DESCRIPTION
       The  sane-teco2  library  implements  a  SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy)
       backend that provides access to some TECO SCSI flatbed  scanners.  This
       backend  should  be considered beta-quality software! TECO scanners are
       sold under various brands like Mustek, Relisys, Piotech, Primax, TRUST.
       This backend may or may not support yours.

       The scanners that should work with this backend are:

                 Vendor Model               TECO model      status
              --------------------------- --------------  -----------

                Relisys SCORPIO Super 3     VM3575         good

       For  all these scanners, lineart and gray mode work well. However, most
       of them do not support more than a  handful  of  resolutions  in  color
       mode.  See the backend home page (under AUTHOR) for the exact status of
       each scanner.

       Note that the untested scanner will  not  be  directly  supported.  You
       should contact the author for that.

       The  TECO VM number can usually be found at the back of the scanner. It
       is also part of the FCC ID.

       The options the backend supports can either be selected through command
       line  options  to programs like scanimage(1) or through GUI elements in
       xscanimage(1), xsane(1), quiteinsane(1) or kooka(1).

       If you have any success with a scanner not listed here, or if  you  no‐
       tice  any  strange behavior, please report to the backend maintainer or
       to the SANE mailing list.

OPTIONS
       Valid command line options and their syntax can be listed by using:

              scanimage --help -d teco2

       Scan Mode

       --mode Lineart|Gray|Color
              selects the basic mode of operation of the scanner.  The Lineart
              mode  is  black  and white only (1 bit).  Gray mode will produce
              256 levels of gray (8 bits).  Color will produce a 24 bits color
              image.

       --resolution 1..600
              Selects  the resolution for a scan. The scanner can do all reso‐
              lutions between 1 and 600, in increments of 1, for  Lineart  and
              Gray.  For Color, a restricted set of resolutions are available.

              Note: All values with ydpi > 300 (300 x 600) or 600 (600 x 1200)
              result in a wrong proportion for the scan. The proportion can be
              adjusted with the following convert(1) command from imagemagick:
              convert -geometry (dpi/max_xdpi * 100%)x100%
              max_xdpi is for the vm3575 constant with 300 dpi e.g. 600dpi ad‐
              just with: convert -geometry 200%x100%

       --preview
              requests a preview scan. The resolution used for that scan is 50
              dpi (for VM356A and VM6575 75 dpi) and the scan area is the max‐
              imum allowed.  The scan mode is user selected.  The  default  is
              "no".

       Geometry options

       -l, -t, -x,  -y
              Control the scan area: -l sets the top left x coordinate, -t the
              top left y coordinate, -x selects the width and -y the height of
              the  scan  area.  All parameters are specified in millimeters by
              default.

       Enhancement options

       --custom-gamma (no custom gamma option for the VM3564 and VM356A)
              (color mode only) allows the user to specify a gamma table  (see
              the next 3 parameters).

OPTIONS FOR COLOR MODE
       These options are valid for scan mode Color only.

       --red-gamma-table
              Can  be  used to download a user defined gamma table for the red
              channel. The table must be 256 bytes long.

       --green-gamma-table
              Can be used to download a user defined gamma table for the green
              channel. The table must be 256 bytes long.

       --blue-gamma-table
              Can  be used to download a user defined gamma table for the blue
              channel. The table must be 256 bytes long.

OPTIONS ONLY FOR VM3564, VM356A, VM3575 and VM6575
       These options are only available for VM3564, VM356A, VM3575 and  VM6575
       models.

       --white-level-r 0..64
              Selects  what  red  radiance level should be considered "white",
              when scanning some sheets  by  changing  the  calibration  value
              loaded into the scanner. Scale 0..64 in steps of 1.

       --white-level-g 0..64
              Selects  what green radiance level should be considered "white",
              when scanning some sheets  by  changing  the  calibration  value
              loaded into the scanner. Scale 0..64 in steps of 1.

       --white-level-b 0..64
              Selects  what  blue radiance level should be considered "white",
              when scanning some sheets  by  changing  the  calibration  value
              loaded into the scanner. Scale 0..64 in steps of 1.

CONFIGURATION FILE
       The  configuration  file /etc/sane.d/teco2.conf supports only one item:
       the device name to use (eg /dev/scanner).

FILES
       /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-teco2.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-teco2.so
              The shared library implementing this backend (present on systems
              that support dynamic loading).

ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_DEBUG_TECO2
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this en‐
              vironment variable controls the debug level  for  this  backend.
              E.g.,  a  value  of 128 requests all debug output to be printed.
              Smaller levels reduce verbosity.

       SANE_TECO2_CAL_ALGO
              Either 0 or 1. Selects the  algorithm  for  the  calibration.  A
              value  of  1  seems  to give better scans on the VM356A, VM3575.
              Feedback on it is welcome.  For VM3564, VM356A,  VM3575,  VM6575
              default 1.  For other supported types default 0.

LIMITATIONS
       The  windows TWAIN driver has many more options than this SANE backend.
       However they are only software adjustments. This  backend  only  imple‐
       ments what the scanner can support.

BUGS
       Plenty. Parts of this backend are still under development.
