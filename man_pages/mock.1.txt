DESCRIPTION

Mock is a
simple program that will build source RPMs inside a chroot.
It doesn&rsquo;t do anything terribly fancy other than
populate a chroot with the contents specified by a
configuration file, then build any input SRPM(s) in that
chroot.

The content of
a chroot is specified by the configuration specified with
the &minus;r option. The default configuration file
is /etc/mock/default.cfg, which is usually a symlink to one
of the installed configurations.

There is a
site-wide configuration file,
/etc/mock/site&minus;defaults.cfg, which can be used to
specify site&minus;wide options. The shipped version of this
file has no active options, but does have a list of all of
the configuration options, examples of how to set them, and
their default values.

For backwards
compatibility, old-style commands, ("rebuild",
"init", "clean", etc.) without leading
&rsquo;&minus;&minus;&rsquo; are still accepted, but are
deprecated. See COMMANDS section, below, for detailed
listing of all commands.

To use mock, a
user should become a member of the mock group by
adding their username to the mock line in /etc/group.
This can be done with the following command:

sudo
/usr/sbin/usermod &minus;a &minus;G mock $USER

Note that mock
is not intended to be run directly as root.

Warning: Mock
is running some parts of code under root privileges. There
are known ways how to get root access once user is in mock
group (and once he is able to run mock). This is possible
when user abuse the mock configuration options. Please do
not add anyone who is not trustworthy to the mock group!

COMMANDS

&minus;&minus;buildsrpm

Builds the specified SRPM
either from a spec file and source file/directory or from
SCM. The chroot is cleaned first, unless
&minus;&minus;no&minus;clean is specified.

&minus;&minus;clean

Purge the chroot tree.

&minus;&minus;copyin

Copies the source paths (files
or directory trees) into the chroot at the specified
destination path.

&minus;&minus;copyout

Copies the source paths (files
or directory trees) from the chroot to the specified
destination path.

&minus;&minus;chroot
COMMAND [ARGS...]

Run the specified command
non&minus;interactively within the chroot (no
&rsquo;clean&rsquo; is performed). Command output will be
sent to the log files. Note that COMMAND is shell expanded
only if there are no ARGS. Otherwise there is no shell
expansion.

&minus;&minus;dnf&minus;cmd

Execute following arguments
with DNF with installroot set to the chroot path. DNF must
be installed on the system. It will use the binary which is
specified in &rsquo;dnf_command&rsquo; option in
site&minus;defaults.cfg config, which by default is
/usr/bin/dnf. This option will enforce
&minus;&minus;dnf.

&minus;&minus;init

Initialize a chroot (clean, install chroot packages,
etc.) 

&minus;i,
&minus;&minus;install

Do a yum install PACKAGE inside
the chroot. No &rsquo;clean&rsquo; is performed

&minus;&minus;installdeps

Find out deps for SRPM or RPM,
and do a yum install to put them in the chroot. No
&rsquo;clean&rsquo; is performed

&minus;l,
&minus;&minus;list&minus;snapshots

List all existing snapshots of
the chroot belonging to current configuration. Current base
snapshot is marked with an asterisk (*)

&minus;&minus;mount

Mount all everything mounted in
the chroot path including the root itself that might have
been a LVM volume or TMPFS.

&minus;&minus;orphanskill

No&minus;op mode that simply
checks that no stray processes are running in the chroot.
Kills any processes that it finds using specified root.

&minus;&minus;pm&minus;cmd

Execute following arguments
with current package manager with installroot set to the
chroot path.

&minus;p,
&minus;&minus;print&minus;root&minus;path

Prints a path to the currently
used chroot directory.

&minus;&minus;rebuild

If no command is specified,
rebuild is assumed. Rebuilds the specified SRPM(s). The
chroot is cleaned first, unless &minus;&minus;no&minus;clean
is specified.

&minus;&minus;remove

Do a yum remove PACKAGE inside
the chroot. No &rsquo;clean&rsquo; is performed

&minus;&minus;remove&minus;snapshot

Remove given snapshot freeing
the space it occupied. This action cannot be undone. This
feature is available only when lvm_root plugin is installed
and enabled.

&minus;&minus;rollback&minus;to

Return chroot to the state in
specified snapshot and set it as the current base to which
clean actions will return. It won&rsquo;t delete nor modify
the snapshot that was set as base previously. This feature
is available only when lvm_root plugin is installed and
enabled.

&minus;&minus;scm&minus;enable

Enable building from an SCM
(CVS/Git/SVN). The SCM repository must be configured in
site&minus;defaults.cfg before SCM checkouts are possible.
SCM package and branch can be defined with
&minus;&minus;scm&minus;option arguments, see
site&minus;defaults.cfg for more information.

&minus;&minus;scrub=TYPE

Completely remove the specified
chroot or cache dir or all of the chroot and cache.
TYPE is one of all, chroot, cache, root&minus;cache,
c&minus;cache, yum&minus;cache or dnf&minus;cache. In fact,
dnf&minus;cache is just alias for yum&minus;cache and both
removes Dnf and Yum cache.

&minus;&minus;shell
[COMMAND [ARGS...]]

Run the specified command
interactively within the chroot (no &rsquo;clean&rsquo; is
performed). If no command specified, /bin/sh is run. Note
that COMMAND is shell expanded using shell in chroot.

&minus;&minus;sources=SOURCES

Specifies sources (either a
single file or a directory of files) to use to build an SRPM
(used only with &minus;&minus;buildsrpm).

&minus;&minus;spec=SPEC

Specifies spec file to use to
build an SRPM (used only with &minus;&minus;buildsrpm).

&minus;&minus;update
[PACKAGE...]

Do a package update inside the
chroot. The package list is optional, if omitted, all
packages will be updated. No &rsquo;clean&rsquo; is
performed

&minus;&minus;snapshot

Make a snapshot of the current
state of the chroot. That snapshot will be set as the
current base to which &minus;&minus;clean and implicit clean
happening during rebuild command will return. This feature
is available only when lvm_root plugin is installed and
enabled.

&minus;&minus;umount

Umount all everything mounted
in the chroot path including the root itself that might have
been a LVM volume or TMPFS.

&minus;&minus;yum&minus;cmd

Execute following arguments
with YUM with installroot set to the chroot path. Yum must
be installed on the system. It will use the binary which is
specified in &rsquo;yum_command&rsquo; option in
site&minus;defaults.cfg config, which by default is
/usr/bin/yum. Note that in config files for Fedora 22+ this
value is overwriten in chroot config to default to
/usr/bin/yum&minus;deprecated. This option will enforce
&minus;&minus;yum.

Note: While you can specify
more commands on command line, only one can 
be executed. The last command will win.

OPTIONS

&minus;&minus;arch=ARCH

Calls the linux personality()
syscall to tell the kernel to emulate a secondary
architecture. For example, building i386 packages on an
x86_64 buildhost.

&minus;&minus;cache&minus;alterations

Rebuild the root cache after
making alterations to the chroot (i.e.
&minus;&minus;install). Only useful when using tmpfs
plugin.

&minus;&minus;cleanup&minus;after

Change to the specified
directory (relative to the chroot) before running command
when using &minus;&minus;chroot

&minus;D "MACRO
EXPR", &minus;&minus;define="MACRO
EXPR"

Specify macro definitions used

as the rpmbuild &minus;&minus;define option can be. For
example:

&minus;&minus;define
"with_extra_cheese 1"
&minus;&minus;define="packager Monkey"

&minus;&minus;disable&minus;plugin=PLUGIN

Disable the specified plugin.
This option may be used multiple times.

&minus;&minus;disablerepo=REPO

Pass
&minus;&minus;disablerepo option to package manager
to disable a repository. It can be specified multiple
times.

&minus;&minus;dnf

Use DNF as the current package manager. You should have
DNF (and dnf&minus;plugins&minus;core) installed on your
system. 

&minus;&minus;enable&minus;plugin=PLUGIN

Enable the specified plugin.
This option may be used multiple times.

&minus;&minus;enablerepo=REPO

&minus;&minus;enablerepo option to package manager to
enable a repository. It can be specified multiple times.

&minus;h,
&minus;&minus;help

Show usage information and
exit.

&minus;&minus;macro&minus;file=FILE

Use pre&minus;defined rpm macro
file. Macros passed to &rsquo;&minus;&minus;define&rsquo;
override macros of the same name from FILE.

&minus;&minus;new&minus;chroot

use new chroot
(systemd&minus;nspawn) &minus; this is experimental and will
break existing scripts.

&minus;n,
&minus;&minus;no&minus;clean

Do not clean chroot before
building package.

&minus;&minus;nocheck

Pass &minus;&minus;nocheck to
rpmbuild to skip &rsquo;make check&rsquo; tests.

&minus;&minus;no&minus;cleanup&minus;after

Don&rsquo;t clean chroot after
building. If automatic cleanup is enabled, use this to
disable.

&minus;&minus;offline

Run in &rsquo;offline&rsquo;
mode where we tell &rsquo;yum&rsquo; to run completely from
local cache. Also disables cache expiry for the mock yum
cache.

&minus;&minus;old&minus;chroot

use old chroot instead of
systemd&minus;nspawn.

&minus;&minus;plugin&minus;option
PLUGIN:KEY=VALUE

Set plugin specific parameter.
This option may be used multiple times.

resulting files (RPMs and build logs) are written. Resultdir
can contain python&minus;string substitutions for any
variable in the chroot config. For example:

&minus;&minus;resultdir=./my/"%(dist)s"/"%(target_arch)s"/

This option
enables automatic cleanup, this can be changed in config
file (by cleanup_on_success, cleanup_on_failure
configuration options) or overridden by
&minus;&minus;no&minus;cleanup&minus;after/&minus;&minus;cleanup&minus;after
arguments.

&minus;&minus;rootdir=ROOTDIR

Path for where the chroot
should be built. By default it is created in

define an SCM option (may be
used more than once).

&minus;&minus;short&minus;circuit=STAGE

Use rpmbuild&rsquo;s
short&minus;circuit mechanism to skip already executed
stages of build. It doesn&rsquo;t produce RPMs, it&rsquo;s
useful only for debugging packaging. Implies
