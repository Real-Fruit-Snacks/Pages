NAME
       zeisstopnm - convert a Zeiss confocal file to PNM

SYNOPSIS
       zeisstopnm

       [-pgm | -ppm]

       [zeissfile]

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       zeisstopnm  reads a Zeiss confocal file as input and produces a PNM im‐
       age as output.

       By default, the exact type of the output depends on the input file:  If
       it's  grayscale  a  PGM  image; otherwise a PPM.  The program tells you
       which type it is writing.  You can override the default with  the  -pgm
       and -ppm options.

OPTIONS
       In  addition  to  the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm
       (most notably -quiet, see
        Common Options ⟨index.html#commonoptions⟩ ), zeisstopnm recognizes the
       following command line options:

       -pgm   Force the output to be in PGM format.

       -ppm   Force the output to be in PPM format.
