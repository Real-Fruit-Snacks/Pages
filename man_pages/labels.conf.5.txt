NAME

labels.conf
- Performance Co-Pilot labels configuration

SYNOPSIS

/etc/pcp/labels.conf

DESCRIPTION

Several
Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) tools and utilities support the
use of metric labels. This functionality applied a
hierarchical set of labels to each instance of every metric,
as described in pmLookupLabels(3).

The
pmcd(1) and pmproxy(1) daemons are
particularly important to the labels system, respectively
providing the labels in real-time and then discovering
recorded (archive) labels and indexing these for
pmseries(1) queries using a
redis-server(1).

The
/etc/pcp/labels.conf file is a single point of
configuration for behaviour affecting all labels exported by
pmcd or through tools using PMAPI local context
services. It uses the common ’’ini’’
file format and any variable it specifies that is not in an
explicit square-bracket enclosed section is considered a
[global] variable.

The available
configuration variables are as follows : 
machineid_hash=none|sha256

When specified in the [global]
section, controls the manner in which the local
machine-id(5) is exported as a label. The default
setting (none) exports a "machineid" context label
with value reflecting the contents of the
/etc/machine-id file, on any platforms that provide
this file. The alternative (sha256) exports a
"machineid_sha256" label, instead, and the value
is the SHA256 (one-way) hash of the file.
