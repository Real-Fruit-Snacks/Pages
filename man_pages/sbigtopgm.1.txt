NAME
       sbigtopgm - convert an SBIG CCDOPS file to PGM

SYNOPSIS
       sbigtopgm

       [sbigfile]

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       sbigtopgm  reads  an  image file in the native format used by the Santa
       Barbara Instrument Group (SBIG) astronomical CCD cameras, and  produces
       a PGM image as output.  Additional information on SBIG cameras and doc‐
       umentation  of  the  file  format  is  available  at  the   Web   site,
       http://www.sbig.com/ ⟨http://www.sbig.com/⟩ .

       sbigtopgm  recognizes some variation on the documented SBIG Type 3 for‐
       mat.  It allows any capitalization  in  the  header.   It  ignores  all
       whitespace  in the header except newlines.  So a header line can end in
       newline, CRLF, or the bizarre LF-CR actually required by the spec.

OPTIONS
       There are no command line options defined specifically  for  sbigtopgm,
       but it recognizes the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm
       (See
        Common Options ⟨index.html#commonoptions⟩ .)
