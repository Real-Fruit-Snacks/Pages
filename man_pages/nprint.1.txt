DESCRIPTION

With
nprint, you can print files on print queues of a
NetWare file server.

There are a lot
of options, so you should probably wrap some default
configurations into some shell scripts.

nprint
looks up the file $HOME/.nwclient to find a file
server, a user name and possibly a password. See nwclient(5)
for more information. Please note that the access
permissions of .nwclient MUST be 600, for security
reasons.

OPTIONS

filename

filename is the name of
the file you want to print. If file is
&rsquo;&minus;&rsquo;, or no filename is given,
standard input is used.

-h

-h is used to print out
a short help text.

-S
server

server is the name of
the server you want to use.

-U
username

username is the user
name to use for the print request at the server.

-P
password

password is the password
to use for the print request at the server. If neither
-n nor -P are given, and the user has no open
connection to the server, nprint prompts for a
password.

-n

-n should be given if no
password is required for the print request.

-C

By default, passwords are
converted to uppercase before they are sent to the server,
because most servers require this. You can turn off this
conversion by -C.

-q
queuename

queuename is the name of
the print queue to use at the print server. At present, you
must specify it in upper case characters.

-d
job-description

job-description is the
string that appears in pconsole when you list the jobs for
the print queue. It will also appear in the
"Description" field on the banner page.

-p
pathname-in-banner

pathname-in-banner is
the string (up to 79 characters) you want to be printed in
the "Directory" field on the banner page.

-B
username-in-banner

username-in-banner is
the string (up to 12 characters) you want to appear on the
lower part of the banner page. It will also appear in the
"User name" field.

-s

Supress printing of banner
page

-f
filename-in-banner

filename-in-banner is
the string (up to 12 characters) you want to appear in large
letters on the lower part of the banner page. Default: the
name of the file that is printed, or
&rsquo;stdin&rsquo;.

-l
lines

lines is the number of
lines to put on one page. Default: 66.

-r
rows

rows is the number of
rows to put on one page. Default: 80.

-c
copies

copies tells the print
server to the specified number of copies. Default: 1.

-t
tabs

tabs is the number of
spaces to print for a Tab-Character. Default: 8.

-T

tells the print server to
expand Tab-Character and use 8 spaces

-N

tells the print server
not to use Form Feeds

-F
form-number

form-number is the the
number of the form to be put into the printer. If it&rsquo;s
different from the one currently in the printer, your job is
only printed if a printer operator has put in the correct
form.

NOTES

The
&rsquo;-B&rsquo; option was formerly
&rsquo;-b&rsquo;. But it conflicted with
&rsquo;bindery only&rsquo; login option.
