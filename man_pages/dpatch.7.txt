[directory] 
debian/patches/script.dpatch -pkg-custom
[directory]

DESCRIPTION

A dpatch
is a program that modifies the source tree in a given
directory. How it does that is entirely up to the
person writing it. It can be a script that calls
patch(1) with the appropriate options, a complicated
perl script that does some deep magic, or anything else. The
only requirement is that it MUST accept the
-patch and -unpatch options, followed by the
destination (or working) directory, when specified. For the
sake of compatibility, the second argument is only present
when a working directory was explicitly set with dpatch
--workdir.

For some of the
dpatch(1) features to work, the script should follow
a common style: there should be a line near the top of the
file with the following format: "filename --
author email>". And one or more
"# DP: description" lines. These will be
used by dpatch cat for example.

WARNING

dpatch
is deprecated, please switch to the ’3.0
(quilt)’ Debian source package format instead. See
http://wiki.debian.org/Projects/DebSrc3.0#FAQ for a
short guide on how to do it.
