NAME
       Dpkg::Control - parse and manipulate official control-like information

DESCRIPTION
       The Dpkg::Control object is a smart version of Dpkg::Control::Hash.  It
       associates a type to the control information. That type can be used to
       know what fields are allowed and in what order they must be output.

       The types are constants that are exported by default. Here's the full
       list:

       CTRL_UNKNOWN
           This type is the default type, it indicates that the type of
           control information is not yet known.

       CTRL_INFO_SRC
           Corresponds to the first stanza in a debian/control file in a
           Debian source package.

METHODS
       All the methods of Dpkg::Control::Hash are available. Those listed
       below are either new or overridden with a different behavior.

       $c = Dpkg::Control->new(%opts)
           If the "type" option is given, it's used to setup default values
           for other options. See set_options() for more details.

       $c->set_options(%opts)
           Changes the value of one or more options. If the "type" option is
           changed, it is used first to define default values for others
           options. The option "allow_pgp" is set to 1 for CTRL_PKG_SRC,
           CTRL_FILE_CHANGES and CTRL_REPO_RELEASE and to 0 otherwise. The
           option "drop_empty" is set to 0 for CTRL_INFO_PKG and CTRL_INFO_SRC
           and to 1 otherwise. The option "name" is set to a textual
           description of the type of control information.

           The output order is also set to match the ordered list returned by
           Dpkg::Control::Fields::field_ordered_list($type).

       $c->get_type()
           Returns the type of control information stored. See the type
           parameter set during new().
