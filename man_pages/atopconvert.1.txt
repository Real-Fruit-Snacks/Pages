NAME

atopconvert
- convert raw log file to newer version

SYNOPSIS

atopconvert
[-t version ] rawinput [rawoutput]

DESCRIPTION

The program
atopconvert can be used to convert the layout of a
raw log file to a newer version. The only mandatory argument
is the name of the raw input file. When no output file is
specified on the command line, atopconvert only shows
the version of the input file. When the name of an output
file is specified, the input file will be converted to the
output file, or just copied when the input file already has
the required version.

The program
atopconvert converts the input file (by default) to
the format used by the newest version of atop and
writes to the output file. With the -t option, an
alternative target version can be specified for the output
file (instead of the newest version) in the format
major.minor (example: 2.3). 
After the conversion is finished, the output file can be
read by the newer version of atop or can even be
extended by that atop version.

NOTES

The raw input
file should be at least of version 2.0!

Files can only
be upgraded to higher version, but not downgraded.
