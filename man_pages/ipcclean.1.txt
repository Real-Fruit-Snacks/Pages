NAME

ipcclean
&minus; remove shared memory and semaphores from an aborted
PostgreSQL server

SYNOPSIS

ipcclean

DESCRIPTION

ipcclean
removes all shared memory segments and semaphore sets owned
by the current user. It is intended to be used for cleaning
up after a crashed PostgreSQL server (postmaster(1)).
Note that immediately restarting the server will also clean
up shared memory and semaphores, so this command is of
little real utility.

Only the
database administrator should execute this program as it can
cause bizarre behavior (i.e., crashes) if run during
multiuser execution. If this command is executed while a
server is running, the shared memory and semaphores
allocated by that server will be deleted, which would have
rather severe consequences for that server.

NOTES

This script is
a hack, but in the many years since it was written, no one
has come up with an equally effective and portable solution.
Since the postmaster can now clean up by itself, it
is unlikely that ipcclean will be improved upon in
the future.

The script
makes assumption about the format of output of the
ipcs utility which may not be true across different
operating systems. Therefore, it may not work on your
particular OS.
