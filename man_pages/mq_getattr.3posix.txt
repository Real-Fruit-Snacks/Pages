PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       mq_getattr — get message queue attributes (REALTIME)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <mqueue.h>

       int mq_getattr(mqd_t mqdes, struct mq_attr *mqstat);

DESCRIPTION
       The mq_getattr() function  shall  obtain  status  information  and  at‐
       tributes  of  the  message queue and the open message queue description
       associated with the message queue descriptor.

       The mqdes argument specifies a message queue descriptor.

       The results shall be returned in the mq_attr  structure  referenced  by
       the mqstat argument.

       Upon  return,  the  following  members shall have the values associated
       with the open message queue description as set when the  message  queue
       was opened and as modified by subsequent mq_setattr() calls: mq_flags.

       The  following attributes of the message queue shall be returned as set
       at message queue creation: mq_maxmsg, mq_msgsize.

       Upon return, the following members within the mq_attr structure  refer‐
       enced  by  the mqstat argument shall be set to the current state of the
       message queue:

       mq_curmsgs
                 The number of messages currently on the queue.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion,  the  mq_getattr()  function  shall  return
       zero. Otherwise, the function shall return -1 and set errno to indicate
       the error.

ERRORS
       The mq_getattr() function may fail if:

       EBADF  The mqdes argument is not a valid message queue descriptor.
