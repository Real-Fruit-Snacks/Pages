NAME

idmap_tdb -
Samba's idmap_tdb Backend for Winbind

DESCRIPTION

The idmap_tdb
plugin is the default backend used by winbindd for storing
SID/uid/gid mapping tables.

In contrast to
read only backends like idmap_rid, it is an allocating
backend: This means that it needs to allocate new user and
group IDs in order to create new mappings.

IDMAP OPTIONS

range = low -
high

Defines the available matching
uid and gid range for which the backend is
authoritative.

EXAMPLES

This example
shows how tdb is used as the default idmap backend. This
configured range is used for uid and gid allocation.

[global]

# "backend = tdb" is redundant here since it
is the default

idmap config * : backend = tdb

idmap config * : range = 1000000-2000000
