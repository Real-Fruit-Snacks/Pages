NAME
       dvddirdel  -  Deletes  a previously authored DVD directory structure in
       DIR

SYNOPSIS
       dvddirdel [ -o DIR ]

DESCRIPTION
       dvddirdel safely deletes a previously authored DVD directory  structure
       in  DIR. Only items that look like part of a DVD-Video directory struc‐
       ture are removed.

       If you just want to replace an existing output  directory  with  a  new
       one, dvdauthor(1) can do that directly with its -O option.

USAGE
       dvddirdel -o DIR

CAVEATS
       None.

BUGS
       None.
