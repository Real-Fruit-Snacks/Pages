NAME

nscd.conf -
configuration file for Name Service Caching Daemon

DESCRIPTION

/etc/nscd.conf
configures the caches used by nscd(8) as well as some
generic options. nscd(8) is able to use a
configuration file at a different location, when supplied
with the -f or --config-file command line
option.

The
configuration file consists of a set of lines. Empty lines,
and text after a &rsquo;#&rsquo; is ignored. All remaining
lines denote the setting of an option. White space before
and after options, and between options and option arguments
is ignored.

There are two
kinds of options: General options influence
nscd(8)&rsquo;s general behaviour, while cache
related options only affect the specified cache. Options are
set like this:

general_option
option 
cache_option cache_name option

GENERAL OPTIONS

logfile file

Specifies the name of the debug
log-file that nscd(8) should use if
debug-level is higher than 0. If this option
is not set, nscd(8) will write its debug output to
stderr.

debug-level level

If level is higher than
0, nscd(8) will create some debug output. The
higher the level, the more verbose the output.

threads #threads

This option sets the number of
threads that nscd(8) should use by default. It can be
overridden by calling nscd(8) with the -t or
--nthreads argument. If neither this configuration
option nor the command line argument is given,
nscd(8) uses 5 threads by default. The minimum is 3.
More threads means more simultaneous connections that
nscd(8) can handle.

max-threads #threads

Specifies the maximum number of
threads to be started.

server-user user

By default, nscd(8) is
run as user root. This option can be set to force
nscd(8) to drop root privileges after startup. It
cannot be used when nscd(8) is called with the
-S or --secure argument. Also note that some
services require that nscd run as root, so using this may
break those lookup services.

stat-user user

Specifies the user who is
allowed to request statistics.

paranoia bool

bool must be one of
yes or no. Enabling paranoia mode causes
nscd(8) to restart itself periodically.

restart-interval time

Sets the restart interval to
time seconds if periodic restart is enabled by enabling
paranoia mode. The default value is 3600.

CACHE OPTIONS

All cache
options take two arguments. The first one denotes the
service or cache the option should affect. Currently
service can be one of passwd, group, or
hosts. 
enable-cache service bool

bool must be one of
yes or no. Each cache is disabled by default
and must be enabled explicitly by setting this options to
yes.

positive-time-to-live service secs

This is the number of seconds
after which a cached entry is removed from the cache. This
defaults to 3600 seconds (i. e. one hour).

negative-time-to-live service secs

If an entry is not found by the
Name Service, it is added to the cache and marked as
"not existent". This option sets the number of
seconds after which such a not existent entry is removed
from the cache. This defaults to 20 seconds for the
password and host caches and to 60 seconds for
the group cache.

suggested-size service prime-number

This option sets the size of
the hash that is used to store the cache entries. As this is
a hash, it should be reasonably larger than the maximum
number of entries that is expected to be cached
simultaneously and should be a prime number. It defaults to
a size of 211 entries.

check-files service bool

bool must be one of
yes (default) or no. If file checking is
enabled, nscd(8) periodically checks the modification
time of /etc/passwd, /etc/group, or
/etc/hosts (for the passwd, group, and
host cache respectively) and invalidates the cache if
the file has changed since the last check.

persistent service bool

bool must be one of
yes (default) or no. Keep the content of the
cache for service over nscd(8) restarts. Useful when
paranoia mode is set.

shared service bool

bool must be one of
yes (default) or no. The memory mapping of the
nscd(8) databases for service is shared with the
clients so that they can directly search in them instead of
having to ask the daemon over the socket each time a lookup
is performed.

reload-count #number

Sets the number of times a
cached record is reloaded before it is pruned from the
cache. Each cache record has a timeout, when that timeout
expires, nscd(8) will either reload it (query the NSS
service again if the data hasn&rsquo;t changed), or drop
it.

max-db-size service number-of-bytes

Sets the maximum allowable size
for the service.

auto-propagate service bool

When set to no for passwd or
group service, then the .byname requests are not
added to passwd.byuid or group.bygid cache.
This may help for tables containing multiple records for the
same id.
