NAME
       ppmbrighten - replaced by pambrighten

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       Starting  with Netpbm 10.86 (March 2019), ppmbrighten is obsolete.  Use
       pambrighten(1) instead.

       pambrighten is mostly backward compatible with  ppmbrighten.   You  can
       use  the  pambrighten manual for ppmbrighten as long as you ignore fea‚Äê
       tures that were added after Netpbm 10.86.

       One way in which pambrighten is not backward compatible is that
         pambrighten does not have a -normalize option.  If you want
         that function, use pnmnorm on the image before passing it to
         pambrighten.

       Another backward incompatibility is that pambrighten produces the
         same kind of output as the input, whereas ppmbrighten always
         produces PPM.  If you need PPM output, pass the results through
         ppmtoppm.

       ppmbrighten is currently implemented as a triviel program that
         invokes pambrighten, pnmnorm, and ppmtoppm.
