string] 

[-width columns]
addrs ...

DESCRIPTION

ap is a
program that parses addresses according to the ARPA Internet
standard. It also understands many non-standard formats. It
is useful for seeing how nmh will interpret an
address.

The ap
program treats each argument as one or more addresses, and
prints those addresses out in the official RFC 822 format.
Hence, it is usually best to enclose each argument in quotes
for the shell.

To override the
output format used by ap, the -format
string or -format file switches are
used. This permits individual fields of the address to be
extracted with ease. The string is simply a format string,
and the file is simply a format file. See
mh-format(5) for the details.

In addition to
the standard escapes, ap also recognizes the
following additional escape:

string

Here is the
default format string used by ap:

if an error was detected, print the error, a
&rsquo;:&rsquo;, and the address in error. Otherwise, output
the RFC 822-proper format of the address.
