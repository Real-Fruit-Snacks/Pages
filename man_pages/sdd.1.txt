NAME

sdd &minus;
disk dump and restore to and from tape or file; copy and/or
reblock

SYNOPSIS

sdd [
option=value ] [ &minus;flag ]

DESCRIPTION

Sdd
copies the specified input file to a specified output file
performing the requested conversions. The standard input and
output are used by default. The input and output block size
may be specified to take advantage of raw physical I/O.

After
completion, sdd reports the number of whole records, the sum
of bytes from partial input and output blocks and the total
amount in kilo bytes on inout and output.

If ibs
and obs differ, sdd is faster than dd
due to the use of an intelligent algorithm.

OPTIONS

&minus;help

Print a summary of the available
options. 

if=name

Input is taken from file
name; default is stdin.

If sdd
is installed suid root, name may be in remote syntax:
user@host:filename as in rcp(1) even if invoked by
non root users. See SUID NOTES for more information.

To make a file
local although it includes a colon (:), the filename must
start with: &rsquo;/&rsquo;, &rsquo;./&rsquo;
or &rsquo;../&rsquo;

of=name

Output is taken from file
name; default is stdout. Note that sdd
creates and truncates the output file by default; therefore
the oseek=# option is useless without the
&minus;notrunc option except in special cases such as
using magnetic tape or disk special files.

If sdd
is installed suid root, name may be in remote syntax:
user@host:filename as in rcp(1) even if invoked by
non root users.

Note that if
sdd talks to an old rmt remote tape server, it
does not open a remote file with the O_CREAT open
flag because this would be extremely dangerous. If the
rmt server on the other side is the rmt server
that comes with star or the GNU rmt server,
sdd may use the symbolic mode for the open flags.
Only the symbolic open modes allow to send all possible open
modes in a portable way to remote tape servers.

It is
recommended to use the rmt server that comes with
star. It is the only rmt server that gives
platform independent compatibility with BSD, Sun and GNU
rmt clients and it includes security features that
may be set up in /etc/default/rmt.

&minus;inull

Do not read input from file. This is similar to
if=/dev/zero but much faster. Sdd uses a prepared
cleared buffer to satisfy writes.

&minus;onull

Do not produce any output. This is similar to
of=/dev/null but actually does not write to
any file.

ibs=#,
obs=#, bs=#

Set input block size, output
block size or both to # (default 512 Bytes).

cbs=#

Set Conversion buffer size to #.

ivsize=#,
ovsize=#

Set input volume size or output
volume size to #. You can make copies from devices of
different size by using this option. If you want to make a
copy to a tape having a size of 60 MBytes you should use the
option ovsize=60M. If the capacity of the tape
is exceeded, sdd wil ask for a second volume. In case
ivsize is exceeded, if N is typed,
it is treated as an EOF condition and sdd writes any
buffered data to output and exits. In case ovsize is
exceeded, if N is typed, sdd stops
and the statistics it prints show that more data were read
than written.

count=#

Transfer # of input records or
until EOF.

iseek=#,
iskip=#

Seek/skip the first # Bytes
from input before beginning transfer.

oseek=#,
oskip=#

Seek/skip the first # Bytes
from output before beginning transfer.

seek=#,
skip=#

Seek/skip the first # Bytes
from input and output before beginning transfer.

ivseek=#,
ovseek=#

Seek # Bytes from
input/output at the beginning of each input/output volume
before beginning transfer. (You can skip labels of disks and
floppies with this option.) Note that the iseek/oseek
options still work, but only apply to the first volume.
Their values are added to the values of ivseek and
ovseek.

&minus;notrunc

Do not truncate an already
existing output file before beginning transfer. This enables
it to copy one file into another.

&minus;pg

Print a dot to stderr each time a record is
written to indicate progress.

&minus;time,
&minus;t

Report the total time and the
transfer rate.

&minus;noerror

Do not stop transfer on I/O
errors. Error messages will appear on the screen.

&minus;noerrwrite

Do not write blocks that are
not read corretly. Seek on the output to skip the bad block.
The output file must be seekable or &minus;noerrwrite
will not work correctly.

&minus;noseek

Do not seek after I/O
errors. This implies try=1.

try=#

Set retry count to #. Only if
&minus;noerror was specified. (default 2)

&minus;debug

Turn on debugging messages. You can get knowledge about
record sizes on tapes with variable record size with this
option. 

&minus;fill

Pad every output record with zeros up to obs. If
ibs equals obs, or only bs was
specified, every record will be padded with zeros, otherwise
this only applies to the last record.

&minus;swab

Swaps bytes (except for the last byte in odd block sizes
and odd transfers due to EOF).

&minus;block,
&minus;unblock

Convert fixed length records to
variable records and vice versa.

&minus;lcase,
&minus;ucase

Map alphabetics to lower/upper
case.

&minus;ascii,
&minus;ebcdic, &minus;ibm

Convert EBCDIC to
ASCII resp. ASCII to EBCDIC resp.
ASCII to the IBM variant of EBCDIC.

&minus;help

Prints a short summary of the sdd options and
exists. 

&minus;version

Prints the sdd version
number string and exists.

EXAMPLES

sdd
if=/dev/rsd0a of=/dev/nrst8 bs=2x7x17b

Copies the disk
/dev/rsd0a to the tape /dev/nrst8 using a
record size of 2*7*17 blocks. (this is 2 Cylinders.)

sdd
if=/dev/rsd0c of=/dev/rsd1c seek=1b bs=63k

Copy the whole
disk sd0 to sd1 preserving the old label on
disk sd1.

FILES

None.

SEE ALSO

dd(1), star(1),
rmt(1), tr(1), cp(1), copy(1)

DIAGNOSTICS

sdd: Read f
records + p bytes (total of x bytes = d.nnk). 
sdd: Wrote f records + p bytes (total of x bytes =
d.nnk).

The number of
full records, the number of bytes in partial records and the
total amount of data in KBytes.

With the
QUIT signal ( usually ^\ ) the actual state is
displayed.

NOTES

Opposed to
dd, sdd is able to handle &minus;iseek
&minus;oseek &minus;seek as well as &minus;iskip
&minus;oskip &minus;skip regardless to the buffer size.
You can make a whole physical copy of a disk without copying
the label in one pass of sdd.

When numbers
are unspecified the are taken to be bytes.

You can make
them &rsquo;words&rsquo; (2 bytes) if they are followed by a
&rsquo;w&rsquo; or &rsquo;W&rsquo;.

You can make
them blocks (512 bytes) if they are followed by a
&rsquo;b&rsquo; or &rsquo;B&rsquo;.

You can make
them Kbytes (1024 bytes) if they are followed by a
&rsquo;k&rsquo; or &rsquo;K&rsquo;.

You can make
them Mbytes (1024 * 1024 bytes) if they are followed by a
&rsquo;m&rsquo; or &rsquo;M&rsquo;.

You can make
them Gbytes (1024 * 1024 *1024 bytes) if they are followed
by a &rsquo;g&rsquo; or &rsquo;G&rsquo;.

A pair of
numbers may be separated by &rsquo;*&rsquo; or
&rsquo;x&rsquo; to indicate a product.

SUID NOTES

If sdd
is installed suid root, sdd is able to make
connections to remote files for non root users. This is done
by using the rcmd(3) interface to get a connection to a
rmt(1) server.

Sdd
resets its effective uid back to the real user id
immediately after setting up the remote connection to the
rmt server and before opening any other file.

BUGS

The option
iskip=# and oskip=# and
skip=# as well as &minus;block and
&minus;unblock are not implemented.

It is confusing
to allow the use of all additions together with the record
counter &minus;count as they are possible with
obs=#.
