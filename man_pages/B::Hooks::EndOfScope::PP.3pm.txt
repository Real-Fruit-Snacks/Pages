B::Hooks::EndOfScope::UserpContributed Perl DocumB::Hooks::EndOfScope::PP(3pm)

NAME
       B::Hooks::EndOfScope::PP - Execute code after a scope finished
       compilation - PP implementation

VERSION
       version 0.26

DESCRIPTION
       This is the pure-perl implementation of B::Hooks::EndOfScope based only
       on modules available as part of the perl core. Its leaner sibling
       B::Hooks::EndOfScope::XS will be automatically preferred if all
       dependencies are available and $ENV{B_HOOKS_ENDOFSCOPE_IMPLEMENTATION}
       is not set to 'PP'.

FUNCTIONS
   on_scope_end
           on_scope_end { ... };

           on_scope_end $code;

       Registers $code to be executed after the surrounding scope has been
       compiled.

       This is exported by default. See Sub::Exporter on how to customize it.
