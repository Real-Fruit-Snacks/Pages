NAME

quadrangle -
reference element (rheolef-7.2)

DESCRIPTION

The quadrangle
reference_element(6) is K = [-1,1]^2.

This
two-dimensional reference_element(6) is then
transformed, after the Piola geometrical application, as a
quadrangle in a 2D or 3D physical space, as a
geo_element(6).

Curved high
order Pk quadrangles (k >= 1), in 2D or 3D geometries,
are supported. These quadrangles have additional edge-nodes
and face-nodes. These nodes are numbered as: first vertex,
then edge-node, following the edge numbering order and
orientation, and finally the face internal nodes, following
the quadrangle lattice.
