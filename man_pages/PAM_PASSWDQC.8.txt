NAME

pam_passwdqc —
Password quality-control PAM module

SYNOPSIS

[service-name]
module-type control-flag pam_passwdqc
[options]

DESCRIPTION

The pam_passwdqc module
is a simple password strength checking module for PAM. In
addition to checking regular passwords, it offers support
for passphrases and can provide randomly generated ones.

The
pam_passwdqc module provides functionality for only
one PAM management group: password changing. In terms of the
module-type parameter, this is the
“password” feature.

The
pam_chauthtok() service function may ask the user for
a new password, and verify that it meets certain minimum
standards. If the chosen password is unsatisfactory, the
service function returns PAM_AUTHTOK_ERR.

The set of
options that may be passed to the module is exactly the same
as the set of options that may be specified in the
configuration file (suggested location
/etc/passwdqc.conf, to be specified in the
config=/etc/passwdqc.conf option). These options are
described in passwdqc.conf(5).

AUTHORS

The pam_passwdqc module
was written for Openwall GNU/*/Linux by Solar Designer
. This manual page was written
for the FreeBSD Project by ThinkSec AS and NAI Labs, the
Security Research Division of Network Associates, Inc. under
DARPA/SPAWAR contract N66001-01-C-8035
(“CBOSS”), as part of the DARPA CHATS research
program. It has since been revised, most importantly to
refer to passwdqc.conf(5) instead of describing the options
right on this page.
