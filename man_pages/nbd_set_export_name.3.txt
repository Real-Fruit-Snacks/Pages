NAME

nbd_set_export_name
- set the export name

SYNOPSIS

#include

int nbd_set_export_name ( 
struct nbd_handle *h, const char *export_name 
);

DESCRIPTION

For servers
which require an export name or can serve different content
on different exports, set the "export_name" to
connect to. The default is the empty string
"".

This is only
relevant when connecting to servers using the newstyle
protocol as the oldstyle protocol did not support export
names. The NBD protocol limits export names to 4096 bytes,
but servers may not support the full length. The encoding of
export names is always UTF-8.

When option
mode is not in use, the export name must be set before
beginning a connection. However, when
nbd_set_opt_mode(3) has enabled option mode, it is
possible to change the export name prior to
nbd_opt_go(3). In particular, the use of
nbd_opt_list(3) during negotiation can be used to
determine a name the server is likely to accept, and
nbd_opt_info(3) can be used to learn details about an
export before connecting.

This call may
be skipped if using nbd_connect_uri(3) to connect to
a URI that includes an export name.

RETURN VALUE

If the call is
successful the function returns 0.

ERRORS

On error -1 is
returned.

Refer to
"ERROR HANDLING" in libnbd(3) for how to
get further details of the error.

The following
parameters must not be NULL: "h",
"export_name". For more information see
"Non-NULL parameters" in libnbd(3).
