NAME
       File::MimeInfo::Applications - Find programs to open a file by mimetype

SYNOPSIS
         use File::MimeInfo::Magic;
         use File::MimeInfo::Applications;

         my $file = '/foo/bar';
         my $mimetype = mimetype($file)
           || die "Could not find mimetype for $file\n";

         my ($default, @other) = mime_applications($mimetype);

         if (defined $default) {
           $default->system($file)
         }
         else {
           # prompt user with choice from @others
           # ...
         }

DESCRIPTION
       This module tries to find applications that can open files with a
       certain mimetype. This is done in the way suggested by the freedesktop
       Desktop Entry specification. This module is intended to be compatible
       with file managers and other applications that implement this
       specification.

       This module depends on File::DesktopEntry being installed.

       To use this module effectively you need to have the desktop-file-utils
       package from freedesktop and run update-desktop-database after
       installing new .desktop files.  See
       <http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/desktop-file-utils>.

       At the moment of writing this module is compatible with the way
       Nautilus (Gnome) and with Thunar (XFCE) handle applications for
       mimetypes. I understand KDE is still working on implementing the
       freedesktop mime specifications but will follow. At the very least all
       perl applications using this module are using the same defaults.

EXPORT
       All methods are exported by default.

METHODS
       "mime_applications(MIMETYPE)"
           Returns an array of File::DesktopEntry objects. The first is the
           default application for this mimetype, the rest are applications
           that say they can handle this mimetype.

           If the first result is undefined there is no default application
           and it is good practice to ask the user which application he wants
           to use.

       "mime_applications_all(MIMETYPE)"
           Like "mime_applications()" but also takes into account applications
           that can open mimetypes from which MIMETYPE inherits. Parent
           mimetypes tell something about the data format, all code inherits
           from text/plain for example.

       "mime_applications_set_default(MIMETYPE, APPLICATION)"
           Save a default application for this mimetype. This action will
           affect other applications using the same mechanism to find a
           default application.

           APPLICATION can either be a File::DesktopEntry object or the
           basename of a .desktop file.

       "mime_applications_set_custom(MIMETYPE, COMMAND)"
           Save a custom shell command as default application.  Generates a
           DesktopEntry file on the fly and calls
           "mime_applications_set_custom".  Returns the DesktopEntry object.

           No checks are done at all on COMMAND.  It should however contain at
           least one word.

NOTES
       This module looks for associations files in the order specified in
       version 1.0 of the MIME applications specification. It will also
       attempt a last-resort fallback to the legacy file
       $XDG_DATA_HOME/applications/defaults.list. In all cases, it will only
       write to the recommended per-user defaults file located at
       $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mimeapps.list.
