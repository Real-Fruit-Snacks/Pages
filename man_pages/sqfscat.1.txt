NAME
       sqfscat - tool to cat files from a squashfs filesystem to stdout

SYNOPSIS
       sqfscat [OPTIONS] FILESYSTEM [list of files to cat to stdout]

DESCRIPTION
       Squashfs  is  a  highly  compressed read-only filesystem for Linux.  It
       uses either gzip/xz/lzo/lz4/zstd compression to  compress  both  files,
       inodes  and  directories.   Inodes in the system are very small and all
       blocks are packed to minimise data overhead. Block sizes  greater  than
       4K are supported up to a maximum of 1Mbytes (default block size 128K).

       Squashfs is intended for general read-only filesystem use, for archival
       use (i.e. in cases where a .tar.gz file  may  be  used),  and  in  con‐
       strained  block device/memory systems (e.g. embedded systems) where low
       overhead is needed.

OPTIONS
       -v, -version
              print version, licence and copyright information.

       -p NUMBER, -processors NUMBER
              use NUMBER processors.  By default will use the number  of  pro‐
              cessors available.

       -o BYTES, -offset BYTES
              skip  BYTES  at start of FILESYSTEM. Optionally a suffix of K, M
              or G can be given to specify Kbytes, Mbytes  or  Gbytes  respec‐
              tively (default 0 bytes).

       -ig, -ignore-errors
              treat errors writing files to stdout as non-fatal.

       -st, -strict-errors
              treat all errors as fatal.

       -no-exit, -no-exit-code
              don't set exit code (to nonzero) on non-fatal errors.

       -da SIZE, -data-queue SIZE
              set data queue to SIZE Mbytes.  Default 256 Mbytes.

       -fr SIZE, -frag-queue SIZE
              set fragment queue to SIZE Mbytes.  Default 256 Mbytes.

       -no-wild, -no-wildcards
              do not use wildcard matching in filenames.

       -r, -regex
              treat filenames as POSIX regular expressions rather than use the
              default shell wildcard expansion (globbing).

       -h, -help
              output options text to stdout.

DECOMPRESSORS AVAILABLE
       gzip, lzo, lz4, xz, zstd, lzma

EXIT STATUS
       0      The file or files were output to stdout OK.

       1      FATAL errors occurred, e.g. filesystem corruption,  I/O  errors.
              Sqfscat did not continue and aborted.

       2      Non-fatal errors occurred, e.g. not a regular file, or failed to
              resolve pathname.  Sqfscat continued and did not abort.

       See -ignore-errors, -strict-errors and -no-exit-code  options  for  how
       they affect the exit status.

EXAMPLES
       sqfscat IMAGE.SQFS hello
              Output the contents of "hello" to stdout.

       sqfscat IMAGE.SQFS hello world
              Output the contents of "hello" and then "world" to stdout.

       sqfscat IMAGE.SQFS "*.[ch]"
              Output  the contents of all the files in the root directory that
              match the wildcard *.[ch], to stdout,  e.g.   hello.c,  hello.h,
              world.c, world.h.

       Note:  when  passing wildcarded names to Sqfscat, they should be quoted
       (as in the above examples), to ensure that they are  not  processed  by
       the shell.
