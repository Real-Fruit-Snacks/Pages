NAME
       GnuPG - The GNU Privacy Guard suite of programs

DESCRIPTION
       GnuPG is a set of programs for public key encryption and digital signa‐
       tures.  The program most users will want to use is the OpenPGP  command
       line  tool, named gpg2.  gpgvis a stripped down version of gpg2 with no
       encryption functionality, used only  to  verify  signatures  against  a
       trusted  keyring.   gpgsm  is the X.509/CMS (for S/MIME) counterpart of
       gpg2. gpg-agent is a passphrase and private key daemon which  may  also
       emulate the ssh-agent.
