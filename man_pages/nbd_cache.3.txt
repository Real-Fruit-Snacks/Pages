NAME

nbd_cache -
send cache (prefetch) command to the NBD server

SYNOPSIS

#include

int nbd_cache ( 
struct nbd_handle *h, uint64_t count, 
uint64_t offset, uint32_t flags 
);

DESCRIPTION

Issue the cache
(prefetch) command to the NBD server, which if supported by
the server causes data to be prefetched into faster storage
by the server, speeding up a subsequent nbd_pread(3)
call. The server can also silently ignore this command. Note
this will generally return an error if
nbd_can_cache(3) is false.

Note that not
all servers can support a "count" of 4GiB or
larger; nbd_get_extended_headers_negotiated(3)
indicates which servers will parse a request larger than 32
bits. The NBD protocol does not yet have a way for a client
to learn if the server will enforce an even smaller maximum
cache size, although a future extension may add a constraint
visible in nbd_get_block_size(3).

The
"flags" parameter must be 0 for now (it exists for
future NBD protocol extensions).

By default,
libnbd will reject attempts to use this function with
parameters that are likely to result in server failure, such
as requesting an unknown command flag. The
nbd_set_strict_mode(3) function can be used to alter
which scenarios should await a server reply rather than
failing fast.

RETURN VALUE

If the call is
successful the function returns 0.

ERRORS

On error -1 is
returned.

Refer to
"ERROR HANDLING" in libnbd(3) for how to
get further details of the error.

The following
parameters must not be NULL: "h". For more
information see "Non-NULL parameters" in
libnbd(3).
