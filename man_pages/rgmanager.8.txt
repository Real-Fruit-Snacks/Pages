NAME

rgmanager
− Resource Group (Cluster Service) Manager Daemon

DESCRIPTION

rgmanager
handles management of user-defined cluster services (also
known as resource groups). This includes handling of user
requests including service start, service disable, service
relocate, and service restart. The service manager daemon
also handles restarting and relocating services in the event
of failures.

HOW IT WORKS

The service
manager is spawned by an init script after the cluster
infrastructure has been started and only functions when the
cluster is quorate and locks are working.

During
initialization, the service manager runs scripts which
ensure that all services are clear to be started. After
that, it determines which services need to be started and
starts them.

When an event
is received, members which are no longer online have their
services taken away from them. The event should only occur
in the case that the member has been fenced whenever fencing
is available.

When a cluster
member determines that it is no longer in the cluster
quorum, the service manager stops all services and waits for
a new quorum to form.

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS

−f

Run in the foreground (do not
fork). 

−d

Enable debug-level logging.

−w

Disable internal process monitoring (for debugging).

−N

Do not perform stop-before-start. Combined with the
-Z flag to clusvcadm, this can be used to allow
rgmanager to be upgraded without stopping a given user
service or set of services.
