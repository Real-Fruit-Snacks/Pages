NAME

lf64 &minus;
transitional interfaces for 64-bit file offsets

DESCRIPTION

The data types,
interfaces, and macros described on this page provide
explicit access to 64-bit file offsets. They are accessible
through the transitional compilation environment described
on the lfcompile64(5) manual page. The function
prototype and semantics of a transitional interface are
equivalent to those of the standard version of the call,
except that relevant data types are 64-bit entities.

Data
Types 
The following tables list the standard data or struct types
in the left-hand column and their corresponding explicit
64-bit file offset types in the right-hand column, grouped
by header. The absence of an entry in the left-hand column
indicates that there is no existing explicit 32-bit type
that corresponds to the 64-bit type listed in the
right&mdash;hand column. Note that in a 64-bit application,
the standard definition is equivalent to the 64-bit file
offset definition.

System
Interfaces 
The following tables display the standard API and the
corresponding transitional interfaces for 64-bit file
offsets. The interfaces are grouped by header. The interface
name and the affected data types are displayed in courier
font..
