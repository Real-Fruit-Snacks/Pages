NAME

nbdkit-full-plugin
- nbdkit plugin which is always full

SYNOPSIS

nbdkit full
[size=]SIZE

DESCRIPTION

"nbdkit-full-plugin"
is a plugin for nbdkit(1). Reads from this virtual
disk return zeroes. All writes and similar operations like
zero and trim fail with "ENOSPC"
(No space left on device) error.

In other words
this behaves like a sparse (thin-provisioned) virtual disk
which has run out of space on the host.

Equivalent
filters 
Although this is a standalone plugin, it is equivalent to
using either nbdkit-readonly-filter(1):

nbdkit
--filter=readonly null SIZE

or
nbdkit-error-filter(1):

nbdkit
--filter=error null SIZE \ 
error-pwrite=ENOSPC error-pwrite-rate=100% \ 
error-trim=ENOSPC error-trim-rate=100% \ 
error-zero=ENOSPC error-zero-rate=100%

Those filters
may be more flexible because you can place them on top of
other plugins and you can control when to inject errors.

PARAMETERS

[size=]SIZE

Specify the virtual size of the
disk image.

This parameter
is required.

"size="
is a magic config key and may be omitted in most cases. See
"Magic parameters" in nbdkit(1).
