NAME

syslogtocern -
convert thttpd syslog entries into CERN Common Log
format

SYNOPSIS

syslogtocern
logfile ...

DESCRIPTION

Reads one or
more syslog files as input. Takes the thttpd entries, and
converts them into CERN Combined Common Log format. Produces
two files as output: access_log and error_log. If files with
those names already exist in the current directory, they are
overwritten.

SEE ALSO

thttpd(8)

BUGS / DEFICIENCIES

Lumps all
thttpd processes together. It ought to produce separate
files for each, identified by IP address and port number.
However, that change represents a huge increase in
complexity, so next version.
