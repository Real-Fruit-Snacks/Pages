MAKEWHATIS(1) BSD General Commands Manual
MAKEWHATIS(1)

NAME

makewhatis &mdash; create
whatis database

SYNOPSIS

makewhatis
[&minus;a] [&minus;i column]
[&minus;n name]
[&minus;o file] [&minus;v]
[&minus;L] [directories ...]

DESCRIPTION

The makewhatis utility
collects the names and short descriptions from all the
unformatted man pages in the directories and puts
them into a file used by the whatis(1) and apropos(1)
commands. Directories may be separated by colons instead of
spaces. If no directories are specified, the contents
of the MANPATH environment variable will be used, or if that
is not set, the default directory /usr/share/man will
be processed.

The options are
as follows:

&minus;a

Appends to the
output file(s) instead of replacing them. The output will be
sorted with duplicate lines removed, but may have obsolete
entries.

&minus;i
column

Indents the
description by column characters. The default value
is 24.

&minus;n name

Uses
name instead of whatis.

&minus;o file

Outputs all
lines to the file instead of */man/whatis.

&minus;v

Makes
makewhatis more verbose about what it is doing.

&minus;L

Process only
localized subdirectories corresponding to the locale
specified in the standard environment variables.

ENVIRONMENT 
LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, LANG

These variables control what
subdirectories will be processed if the &minus;L
option is used.

MACHINE

If set, its
value is used to override the current machine type when
searching machine specific subdirectories.

MANPATH

Determines the
set of directories to be processed if none are given on the
command line.

FILES 
/usr/share/man

Default
directory to process if the MANPATH environment variable is
not set.

*/man/whatis

The default
output file.

DIAGNOSTICS

The makewhatis utility
exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error
occurs.
