NAME

sd-device - API
for enumerating and introspecting local devices

SYNOPSIS

#include

pkg-config --cflags --libs
libsystemd 

DESCRIPTION

sd-device.h is
part of libsystemd(3) and provides an API to
introspect and enumerate devices on the local system. It
provides a programmatic interface to the database of devices
and their properties mananaged by
systemd-udevd.service(8). This API is a replacement
for libudev(3) and libudev.h.

See

sd_device_get_syspath(3),

sd_device_ref(3)

for more information about the
functions available.

NOTES

Functions
described here are available as a shared library, which can
be compiled against and linked to with the
libsystemd pkg-config(1) file.

The code
described here uses getenv(3), which is declared to
be not multi-thread-safe. This means that the code calling
the functions described here must not call setenv(3)
from a parallel thread. It is recommended to only do calls
to setenv() from an early phase of the program when
no other threads have been started.
