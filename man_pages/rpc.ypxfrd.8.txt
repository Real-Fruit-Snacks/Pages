NAME

rpc.ypxfrd -
NIS map transfer server

SYNOPSIS

/usr/sbin/rpc.ypxfrd
[-d path] [-p port] [--debug]

/usr/sbin/rpc.ypxfrd
--version 

DESCRIPTION

rpc.ypxfrd
is used for speed up the transfer of very large NIS maps
from a NIS master to the NIS slave server. If a NIS slave
server receives a message that there is a new map, it will
start ypxfr for transfering the new map. ypxfr
will read the contents of a map from the master server using
the yp_all() function.

The
rpc.ypxfrd server speeds up the transfer process by
allowing NIS slave servers to simply copy the master servers
map files rather than building their own from scratch.
rpc.ypxfrd uses an RPC-based file transfer
protocol.

If the on-disk
format of the database on both machines is not the same,
rpc.ypxfrd will refuse to send the data and
ypxfr will fallback to yp_all() and fetch
every single entry alone.

rpc.ypxfrd
could be started by inetd. But since it starts very slowly,
it should be started after ypserv from
/etc/init.d/ypxfrd.

OPTIONS

--debug

Causes the server to run in
debugging mode. In debug mode, the server does not
background itself and prints extra status messages to stderr
for each request that it revceives.

-d
path

rpc.ypxfrd is using this
directory instead of /var/yp.

-p
port

rpc.ypxfrd will bind
itself to this port, which makes it possible to have a
router filter packets to the NIS ports. This can restricted
the access to the NIS server from hosts on the Internet.

--version

Prints the version number

SECURITY

rpc.ypxfrd
uses the same functions for checking a host as
ypserv. At first, rpc.ypxfrd will check a
request from an address with /var/yp/securenets or the tcp
wrapper. If the host is allowed to connect to the server,
rpc.ypxfrd will uses the rules from /etc/ypserv.conf
to check the requested map. If a mapname doesn't match a
rule, rpc.ypxfrd will look for the YP_SECURE key in
the map. If it exists, rpc.ypxfrd will only allow
requests on a reserved port.

NOTES

The FreeBSD
ypxfrd protocol is not compatible with that used by
SunOS. This is unfortunate but unavoidable: SUNs protocol is
not freely available, and even if it were it would probably
not be useful since the SunOS NIS v2 implementation uses the
original ndbm package for its map databases whereas the
other implementation uses GNU DBM or Berkeley DB. These
packages uses vastly different file formats. Furthermore,
ndbm and gdbm are byte-order and word width sensitive and
not very smart about it, meaning that a gdbm or ndbm
database created on a big endian or 64bit system cannot be
read on a little endian or 32bit system. The FreeBSD
ypxfrd protocol checks, if both, master and slave,
uses the same database packages and, if necessary, the byte
order of the system.
