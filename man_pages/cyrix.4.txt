DESCRIPTION

cyrix is
an Xorg driver for the Cyrix MediaGX (now Natsemi Geode)
series of processors when using the built in video.

SUPPORTED HARDWARE

The
cyrix driver supports the MediaGX, MediaGXi and
MediaGXm processors, as well as the Natsemi
&rsquo;Geode&rsquo; branded processors. It supports the
CS5510, CS5520, CS5530 and CS5530A companion chips. The
driver supports 4, 8, 15 and 16 bit deep displays with video
compression and acceleration.

The MediaGX run
length compresses its shared framebuffer, for the best
performance on a MediaGX machine pick backgrounds that
compress well horizontally.

xorg.conf(5x) for general configuration details. This

Option "NoAccel"

BUGS

This driver has
not been tested on the original 5510 hardware for some
considerable time.

8bit mode does
not currently work on the CS5510 with external RAMDAC.

The 5530A video
overlay facility is not currently supported.

Xorg uses the
MediaGX &rsquo;SoftVGA&rsquo; interface. On a small number
of boards this is buggy and may result in strange illegal
instruction traps.

Hardware
cursors are not currently supported.
