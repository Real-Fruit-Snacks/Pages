WCSCPY(3POSIX)             POSIX Programmer's Manual            WCSCPY(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       wcpcpy, wcscpy — copy a wide-character string, returning a  pointer  to
       its end

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       wchar_t *wcpcpy(wchar_t *restrict ws1, const wchar_t *restrict ws2);
       wchar_t *wcscpy(wchar_t *restrict ws1, const wchar_t *restrict ws2);

DESCRIPTION
       For  wcscpy():  The  functionality  described on this reference page is
       aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the  requirements
       described  here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The wcpcpy() and  wcscpy()  functions  shall  copy  the  wide-character
       string pointed to by ws2 (including the terminating null wide-character
       code) into the array pointed to by ws1.

       The application shall ensure that  there  is  room  for  at  least  wc‐
       slen(ws2)+1  wide characters in the ws1 array, and that the ws2 and ws1
       arrays do not overlap.

       If copying takes place between objects that overlap,  the  behavior  is
       undefined.

RETURN VALUE
       The  wcpcpy()  function  shall return a pointer to the terminating null
       wide-character code copied into the ws1 buffer.

       The wcscpy() function shall return ws1.

       No return values are reserved to indicate an error.

ERRORS
       No errors are defined.
