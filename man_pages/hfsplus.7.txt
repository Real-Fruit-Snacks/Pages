NAME

hfsplus â€”
a set of tools to access HFS+ file systems

Description

HFS+, also
known as the Macintosh Extended Format, was introduced by
Apple Computer in 1998 with the release of MacOS 8.1. It
contains many improvements over the old HFS file system,
most notably the ability to allocate up to 2^64 blocks,
resulting in much more efficient storage of many small files
on large disks.

The
hfsplus collection allows one to access volumes
formatted with the HFS+ file system from Debian
GNU/Linux and related operating systems. The collection
contains tools to mount and unmount HFS+ volumes, to change
and list directories, and to copy files to and from HFS+
volumes.

Note that
unlike its cousin, the hfsutils collection used for
accessing HFS file systems, hfsplus does not use the
Macintosh pathname syntax with ":" as delimiter.
Instead, it mimics the unix notation, delimiting the names
of volumes, directories and files in a path with
"/", and also understands "." and
".." to some extent.
