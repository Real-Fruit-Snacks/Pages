NAME
       pnminvert - invert a PNM image

SYNOPSIS
       pnminvert

       [pnmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       pnminvert  reads  a PNM image as input, inverts it black for white, and
       produces a PNM image as output.

       If the image is grayscale, pnminvert replaces a pixel with one of  com-
       plementary  brightness,  i.e.  if the original pixel has gamma-adjusted
       gray value G, the output pixel has gray value maxval - G.

       If the image is color, pnminvert inverts each individual RGB  component
       the same as for a grayscale image.

OPTIONS
       There  are  no command line options defined specifically for pnminvert,
       but it recognizes the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm
       (See
        Common Options <index.html#commonoptions> .)
