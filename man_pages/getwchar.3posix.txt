GETWCHAR(3POSIX)           POSIX Programmer's Manual          GETWCHAR(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       getwchar — get a wide character from a stdin stream

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       wint_t getwchar(void);

DESCRIPTION
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with  the
       ISO C  standard.  Any  conflict between the requirements described here
       and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017
       defers to the ISO C standard.

       The getwchar() function shall be equivalent to getwc(stdin).

RETURN VALUE
       Refer to fgetwc().

ERRORS
       Refer to fgetwc().

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       If the wint_t value returned by getwchar() is stored into a variable of
       type wchar_t and then compared against the wint_t macro WEOF,  the  re‐
       sult may be incorrect. Only the wint_t type is guaranteed to be able to
       represent any wide character and WEOF.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
