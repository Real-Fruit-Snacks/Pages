NAME

nbdkit-offset-filter
- nbdkit offset filter

SYNOPSIS

nbdkit
--filter=offset plugin offset=OFFSET range=LENGTH
[plugin-args...]

DESCRIPTION

"nbdkit-offset-filter"
is a filter that limits requests to the byte range
"[offset .. offset+range-1]" within another
plugin.

PARAMETERS

offset=OFFSET

The start offset. The offset
must be &ge; 0.

This parameter
is optional. If not given then "offset=0" is
assumed.

range=LENGTH

The length of data to
serve.

This parameter
is optional. If not given then the range is served starting
from the offset through to the end of the underlying
file/device.

Note it is an
error if the offset and/or range specify data which lies
beyond the end of the underlying device. Use
nbdkit-truncate-filter(1) to truncate or extend the
size of plugins.

EXAMPLES

Serve part
of a file 
Using nbdkit-file-plugin(1), serve the file
"disk.img" starting at offset "1M". The
total length served is "100M" (the underlying file
must therefore be at least "101M" in length):

nbdkit
--filter=offset file disk.img offset=1M range=100M

Serve a
single partition 
An easier way to do this is with
nbdkit-partition-filter(1).

One way to
serve a single partition from a disk is to find the start
and length of the partition, eg using:

$ parted
disk.img -- unit b print 
... 
Number Start End Size Type File system Flags 
1 65536B 104792575B 104727040B primary ext2

You can then
serve the partition only using:

nbdkit
--filter=offset file disk.img offset=65536
range=104727040

FILES

$filterdir/nbdkit-offset-filter.so

The filter.

Use
"nbdkit --dump-config" to find the location of
$filterdir.

VERSION

"nbdkit-offset-filter"
first appeared in nbdkit 1.2.
