       port   The  number  of a port on the current host at which to start the

DESCRIPTION
       The rmiregistry command creates and starts a remote object registry  on
       the  specified  port on the current host.  If the port is omitted, then
       the registry is started on port 1099.  The rmiregistry command produces
       no output and is typically run in the background, for example:

              rmiregistry &

       A  remote  object registry is a bootstrap naming service that's used by
       RMI servers on the same host to bind remote objects to names.   Clients
       on  local and remote hosts can then look up remote objects and make re‐
       mote method invocations.

       The registry is typically used to locate the  first  remote  object  on
       which  an application needs to call methods.  That object then provides
       application-specific support for finding other objects.

       The methods of the java.rmi.registry.LocateRegistry class are  used  to
       get a registry operating on the local host or local host and port.

       The  URL-based  methods  of the java.rmi.Naming class operate on a reg‐
       istry and can be used to:

       • Bind the specified name to a remote object

       • Return an array of the names bound in the registry

       • Return a reference, a stub, for the remote object associated with the
         specified name

       • Rebind the specified name to a new remote object

       • Destroy  the  binding for the specified name that's associated with a
         remote object

OPTIONS
       -Joption
              Used with any Java option to pass the option  following  the  -J
              (no  spaces  between  the  -J and the option) to the Java inter‐
              preter.
