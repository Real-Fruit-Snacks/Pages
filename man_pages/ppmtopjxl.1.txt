NAME

ppmtopjxl -
convert a PPM image to an HP PaintJet XL PCL file

SYNOPSIS

ppmtopjxl
[-nopack] [-gamma n]
[-presentation] [-dark] [-diffuse]
[-cluster] [-dither] [-xshift s]
[-yshift s] [-xshift s]
[-yshift s]
[{-xsize|-width|-xscale} s]
[{-ysize|-height|-yscale} s]
[ppmfile]

DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

ppmtopjxl
reads a PPM image as input and produces a PCL file suitable
for printing on an HP PaintJet XL printer as output.

The generated
file is not suitable for printing on a normal PrintJet
printer. The -nopack option generates a file which
does not use the normal TIFF 4.0 compression method and thus
might be printable on a normal PaintJet printer (not an
XL).

OPTIONS

In addition to
the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most
notably -quiet, see
 Common Options ),
ppmtopjxl recognizes the following command line
options: 
-nopack

Generate a file
which does not use the normal TIFF 4.0 compression method.
This file might be printable on a normal PaintJet printer
(not an XL).

-gamma

Set the gamma correction for the image. The useful range
for the PaintJet XL is approximately 0.6 to 1.5.

-dither,
-cluster, -diffuse

Alter the
rendering algorithm used for images. These options select
ordered dithering, clustered ordered dithering, or error
diffusion respectively.

-dark

Enhance images with a dark background when they are
reduced in size.

-presentation

Turn on
presentation mode, in which two passes are made over the
paper to increase ink density. You should use this only for
images where quality is critical.

-xsize,
-ysize

Resize the
image. The parameter to either of these options is
interpreted as the number of dots to set the width or height
to, but you may append an optional dimension of
’pt’ (points), ’dp’
(decipoints), ’in’ (inches), or
’cm’ (centimetres). If you specify only
one dimension, ppmtopjxl will scale the other one
appropriately.

-width,
-height

Synonyms of
-xsize and -ysize.

-xscale,
-yscale

Alternatives to
-xsize and -ysize. Scale the image by a simple
factor.

-xshift,
-yshift

Shift the image
on the page. These move the image the specified dimensions
right and down.
