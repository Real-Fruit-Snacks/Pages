NAME
       gp-collect-app - collect performance data for the target application

SYNOPSIS
       gprofng collect app [OPTION(S)] TARGET [TARGET_ARGUMENTS]

DESCRIPTION
       Collect  performance data on the target program. In addition to Program
       Counter PC) sampling, hardware event counters and various  tracing  op‐
       tions are supported.

OPTIONS
       --version
              print the version number and exit.

       --help print usage information and exit.

       --verbose {on|off}
              enable (on) or disable (off) verbose mode; the default is "off".

       -p {off|on|lo|hi|<value>}
              disable  (off)  or  enable  (on) clock-profiling using a default
              sampling granularity, or enable  clock-profiling  implicitly  by
              setting the sampling granularity (lo, hi, or a specific value in
              ms); by default clock profiling is enabled.

       -h {<ctr_def>...,<ctr_n_def>}
              enable  hardware  event  counter  profiling   and   select   the
              counter(s); to see the supported counters on this system use the
              -h option without other arguments.

       -o <exp_name>
              specify the name for (and path to) the experiment directory; the
              the default path is the current directory.

       -O <exp_name>
              the  same as -o, but unlike the -o option, silently overwrite an
              existing experiment directory with the same name.

       -C <label>
              add up to 10 comment labels to the experiment;  comments  appear
              in the notes section of the header.

       -j  {on|off|<path>}  enable  (on), or disable (off) Java profiling when
       the target
              program is a JVM; optionally set the  <path>  to  a  non-default
              JVM; the default is "-j on".

       -J <java-args>
              specify arguments to the JVM.

       -t <duration>[m|s]
              specify the duration over which to record data; the default unit
              is seconds (s), but can be set to minutes (m).

       -n     dry run; display several run-time settings, but do not  run  the
              target, or collect performance data.

       -y <signal>[,r]
              specify delayed initialization and a pause/resume signal; by de‐
              fault the target starts in paused mode; if the optional  r  key‐
              word is provided, start in resumed mode.

       -F {off|on|=<regex>}
              control  to  follow  descendant processes; disable (off), enable
              (on), or collect data on all  descendant  processes  whose  name
              matches  the  specified  regular  expression; the default is "-F
              on".

       -a {off|on|ldobjects|src|usedldobjects|usedsrc}
              specify archiving of binaries and other files;  in  addition  to
              disable  this feature (off), or enable archiving off all loadob‐
              jects and sources (on), the other options support a more refined
              selection.  All  of these options enable archiving, but the key‐
              word controls what exactly is selected: all load objects  (ldob‐
              jects),  all source files (src), the loadobjects asscoiated with
              a program counter (usedldobjects), or the source  files  associ‐
              ated  with a program counter (usedsrc); the default is "-a ldob‐
              jects".

       -S {off|on|<seconds>}
              disable (off) or enable (on) periodic sampling  of  process-wide
              resource  utilization;  by default sampling occurs every second;
              use the <seconds> option to change this; the default is "-S on".

       -l <signal>
              specify a signal that will trigger a sample of process-wide  re‐
              source utilization.

       -s <option>[,<API>]
              enable  synchronization wait tracing; <option> is used to define
              the specifics of the tracing (on,  off,  <threshold>,  or  all);
              <API>  is  used  to select the API: "n" selects native/Pthreads,
              "j" selects Java, and "nj" selects  both;  the  default  is  "-s
              off".

       -H {off|on}
              disable  (off),  or enable (on) heap tracing; the default is "-H
              off".

       -i {off|on}
              disable (off), or enable (on) I/O tracing; the  default  is  "-i
              off".
