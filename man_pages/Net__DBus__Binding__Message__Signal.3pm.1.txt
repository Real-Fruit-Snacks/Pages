NAME
       Net::DBus::Binding::Message::Signal - a message encoding a signal

SYNOPSIS
         use Net::DBus::Binding::Message::Signal;

         my $signal = Net::DBus::Binding::Message::Signal->new(
             object_path => "/org/example/myobject",
             interface => "org.example.myobject",
             signal_name => "foo_changed");

         $connection->send($signal);

DESCRIPTION
       This module is part of the low-level DBus binding APIs, and should not
       be used by application code. No guarantees are made about APIs under
       the "Net::DBus::Binding::" namespace being stable across releases.

       This module provides a convenience constructor for creating a message
       representing a signal.

METHODS
       my $signal = Net::DBus::Binding::Message::Signal->new( object_path =>
       $path, interface => $interface, signal_name => $name);
           Creates a new message, representing a signal [to be] emitted by the
           object located under the path given by the "object_path" parameter.
           The name of the signal is given by the "signal_name" parameter, and
           is scoped to the interface given by the "interface" parameter.
