DESCRIPTION

System activity
data can be accessed at the special request of a user (see
sar(1)) and automatically, on a routine basis, as
described here. The operating system contains several
counters that are incremented as various system actions
occur. These include counters for CPU utilization,
buffer usage, disk and tape I/O activity, TTY
device activity, switching and system-call activity,
file-access, queue activity, inter-process communications,
and paging. For more general system statistics, use
iostat (1M), sar(1), or vmstat(1M).

sadc and
two shell procedures, sa1 and sa2, are used to
sample, save, and process this data.

sadc,
the data collector, samples system data n times, with
an interval of t seconds between samples, and writes
in binary format to ofile or to standard output. The
sampling interval t should be greater than 5 seconds;
otherwise, the activity of sadc itself may affect the
sample. If t and n are omitted, a special
record is written. This facility can be used at system boot
time, when booting to a 
multi-user state, to mark the time at which the counters
restart from zero. For example, when accounting is enabled,
the /etc/init.d/perf file writes the restart mark to
the daily data file using the command entry:

su sys
-c "/usr/lib/sa/sadc /var/adm/sa/sa’date
+%d’"

The shell
script sa1, a variant of sadc, is used to
collect and store data in the binary file
/var/adm/sa/sadd, where dd is the
current day. The arguments t and n cause
records to be written n times at an interval of
t seconds, or once if omitted. The following entries
in /var/spool/cron/crontabs/sys will produce records
every 20 minutes during working hours and hourly
otherwise:

0 * * * 0-6
/usr/lib/sa/sa1 
20,40 8−17 * * 1−5 /usr/lib/sa/sa1

See
crontab(1) for details.

The shell
script sa2, a variant of sar, writes a daily
report in the file /var/adm/sa/sardd. See the
OPTIONS section in sar(1) for an explanation
of the various options. The following entry in
/var/spool/cron/crontabs/sys will report important
activities hourly during the working day:

5 18 * *
1−5 /usr/lib/sa/sa2 -s 8:00 -e 18:01
-i 1200 -A
