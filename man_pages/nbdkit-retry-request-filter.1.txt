NAME

nbdkit-retry-request-filter
- retry single requests on error

SYNOPSIS

nbdkit
--filter=retry-request PLUGIN 
[retry-request-retries=N] [retry-request-delay=N] 
[retry-request-open=false]

DESCRIPTION

"nbdkit-retry-request-filter"
is a filter for nbdkit that transparently retries single
requests if they fail. This is useful for plugins that are
not completely reliable or have random behaviour. For
example nbdkit-curl-plugin(1) might behave this way
if pointed at a load balancer which sometimes redirects to a
web server that is not responsive.

An alternative
filter with different trade-offs is
nbdkit-retry-filter(1). That filter is more
heavyweight because it always reopens the whole plugin
connection on failure.

PARAMETERS

retry-request-retries=N

The number of times any single
request will be retried before we give up and fail the
operation. The default is 2.

retry-request-delay=N

The number of seconds to wait
before retrying. The default is 2 seconds.

retry-request-open=false

If set to false, do not retry
opening the plugin. The default is to treat plugin open in
the same way as other requests.

FILES

$filterdir/nbdkit-retry-request-filter.so

The filter.

Use
"nbdkit --dump-config" to find the location of
$filterdir.
