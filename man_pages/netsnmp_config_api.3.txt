DESCRIPTION

The functions
are a fairly extensible system of parsing various
configuration files at the run time of an application. The
configuration file flow is broken into the following
phases:

1.

Registration of handlers.

2.

Reading of the configuration files for pre-MIB parsing
requirements. 

3.

Reading and parsing of the textual MIB files.

4.

Reading of the configuration files for configuration
directives. 

5.

Optionally re-reading the configuration files at a
future date.

The idea is
that the calling application is able to register
handlers for certain tokens specified in
certain named configuration files. The
read_configs() function can then be called to look
for all relevant configuration files, match the first word
on each line against the list of registered tokens and pass
the remainder of the line to the appropriate registered
handler.

REGISTERING A HANDLER

register_config_handler()

Registers a configuration
handler routine, which should be called to process
configuration directives starting with the specified token.
For example:

register_config_handler("snmp",
"exampleToken", example_handler, NULL, "ARG1
[ARG2]");

would register
the example_handler() function so that it will get
called every time the first word of a line in the
snmp.conf configuration file(s) matches
"exampleToken". 
Calling the appropriate handlers to process the
configuration file directives is the responsibility of
read_configs() (see below).

register_const_config_handler()

Similar to the
register_config_handler() function, but the parser
routine is explicitly constrained to not modify the string
being parsed.

register_prenetsnmp_mib_handler()

Similar to the
register_config_handler() function, but the
registered handler routine will be called before the
textual MIBs are read in. This is typically used for tokens
that will affect the configuration of the MIB parser, and
will normally only be used within the SNMP library
itself.

register_mib_handlers()

Initialisation routine to
register the internal SNMP library configuration
handlers.

unregister_config_handler()

Removes the registered
configuration handler for the specified filePrefix
and token.

unregister_all_config_handlers()

Removes all registered
configuration handlers.

Token
Handlers 
Handler functions should have the following signature:

void
handler(const char *token, char
*line); 
or 
void handler(const char *token, const char
*line); br (if registered using
register_const_config_handler)

The function
will be called with two arguments, the first being the token
that triggered the call to this function (i.e. the token
used when registering the handler), and the second being the
remainder of the configuration file line (i.e. everything
following the white space following the matched token).

Freeing
Handlers 
If the token handler function dynamically allocates
resources when processing a configuration entry, then these
may need to be released before re-reading the configuration
files. If the fourth parameter ( releaser ) passed to
register_config_handler is non-NULL, then this
specifies a function to be called before re-reading the
configuration files. This function should free any resources
allocated by the token handler function and reset its notion
of the configuration to its default. The token handler
function can then safely be called again. No arguments are
passed to the resource freeing handler. 
Note that this function is not called when the handler is
unregistered individually (but is called as part of
unregister_all_config_handlers() ).

Application
Handlers 
register_app_config_handler() 
register_app_prenetsnmp_mib_handler() 
unregister_app_config_handler()

These functions are analagous
to register_config_handler(),
register_prenetsnmp_mib_handler() and
unregister_config_handler() but do not require the
file type argument (which is filled in by the application).
It is intended that MIB modules written for the agent use
these functions to allow the agent to have more control over
which configuration files are read (typically the
snmpd.conf files).

READING CONFIGURATION FILES

read_premib_configs()

read_configs()

These routines process the
configuration files found in the configuration search path
(see below). For each entry, the handler registered for that
configuration token is called.

read_premib_configs()
is run before the MIB files are read in, and processes those
configuration tokens registered using
register_prenetsnmp_mib_handler() (or
register_app_prenetsnmp_mib_handler() ). All other
entries are ignored.

read_configs()
is run after the MIB files have been read in, and processes
those configuration tokens registered using
register_config_handler() (or
register_app_config_handler() ). If it encounters a
configuration token for which no handler has been registered
(either pre- or post-mib), then it will display a warning
message, and continue processing with the next line of the
configuration file.

Configuration
Search Path 
The configuration files to be read are found by searching a
list of configuration directories for appropriately named
files. In each such directory, the library will look for
files named 
snmp.conf, 
snmp.local.conf, 
app.conf, 
app.local.conf, 
(where app is the appication-specific filePrefix used
to register configuration handlers). It is not necessary for
any or all of these files to be present in each directory.
Missing files will be silently skipped. 
The idea behind the two different suffixes is that the first
file can be shared (via rdist or an NFS mount) across a
large number of machines and the second file can be used to
configure local settings for one particular machine.

The default
list of directories to search is /etc/snmp,
followed by /usr/share/snmp, followed by
/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/snmp, followed by
$HOME/.snmp. This list can be changed by setting
the environmental variable SNMPCONFPATH to be a
(colon separated) list of directories to search.

init_snmp()

The normal mode of operation would be to register the
application-specific configuration handlers, and then invoke
init_snmp(). This would call the routines listed
above to register the internal library configuration
handlers, process any configuration tokens registered with
register_prenetsnmp_mib_handler(), read in the
textual MIB files using init_mib(), and finally parse
the configuration file tokens registered with
register_config_handler().

If the
init_snmp() function is used, none of these functions
need to be explicitly called by the application.

HELP STRINGS AND ERRORS

The
usageLine parameter passed to
register_config_handler() and similar calls, is used
to display help information when the
read_config_print_usage() function is called. This
function is used by all of the applications when the
-H flag is passed on the command line. It prints a
summary of all of the configuration file lines, and the
associated files, that the configuration system understands.
The usageLine parameter should be a list of arguments
expected after the token, and not a lengthy description
(which should go into a manual page instead). The
lead prefix will be prepended to each line that the
function prints to stderr, where it displays its output.

The
init_snmp() function should be called before the
read_config_print_usage() function is called, so that
the library can register its configuration file directives
as well for the read_config_print_usage() function to
display.

Error
Handling Functions 
The two functions config_pwarn() and
config_perror() both take an error string as an
argument and print it to stderr along with the file and line
number that caused the error. A call to the second function
will also force read_configs() to eventually return
with an error code indicating to itâ€™s calling function
that it should abort the operation of the application.
