DESCRIPTION

genpng
creates an overview image for a given source code file of
either plain text or .gcov file format.

Note that the
GD.pm Perl module has to be installed for this script
to work (it may be obtained from
http://www.cpan.org).

Note also that
genpng is called from within genhtml so that
there is usually no need to call it directly.

OPTIONS

-h 
--help

Print a short help text, then
exit.

-v 
--version

Print version number, then
exit.

-t
tab-size 
--tab-size tab-size

Use tab-size spaces in
place of tab.

All occurrences
of tabulator signs in the source code file will be replaced
by the number of spaces defined by tab-size (default
is 4).

-w
width 
--width width

Set width of output image to
width pixel.

The resulting
image will be exactly width pixel wide (default is
80).

Note that
source code lines which are longer than width will be
truncated.

filename 
--output-filename filename

Write image to
