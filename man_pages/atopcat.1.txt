NAME

atopcat
- concatenate raw log files to stdout

SYNOPSIS

atopcat
[-dv] rawfile [rawfile]...

DESCRIPTION

The program
atopcat can be used to concatenate several raw log
files into one stream (stdout). In this way, raw log files
can be merged into one larger file by redirecting stdout to
a file. Alternatively, merged data from several raw log
files can be transferred directly into atop or
atopsar via a pipe.

Options:

-d

dry-run: read logfile(s) but do not generate output on
stdout 

-v

verbose: print one line per sample containing date/time,
interval length in seconds, compressed length of the
system-level information and compressed length of the
process-level information.

EXAMPLES

Concatenate the
raw log files of five contiguous working days, write it into
a new raw log file for that week and view that week
interactively:   
atopcat /var/log/atop/atop_2020021[0-4] > week_2020_7

atop -r week_2020_7

Concatenate the
raw log files of a week and view that week interactively
(since atop reads from a pipe, previous intervals can
not be retrieved while viewing):   
atopcat /var/log/atop/atop_2020021[0-6] | atop -r -

Concatenate all
raw log files of January 2020 and generate parsable output
about the CPU utilization:   
atopcat /var/log/atop/atop_202001?? | atop -r -
-PCPU

Concatenate the
daily raw log files of February 3 and 4, and generate a
report about memory utilization from 14:00h on the first day
till 11:00h on the second day:   
atopcat /var/log/atop/atop_2020020[34] |  

atopsar -m -r - -b
202002031400 -e 202002041100

Repair a raw
log file from which the last interval has not been
completely written (e.g. if you intend to expand the file
with new samples):   
atopcat /var/log/atop/atop_20200303 >
/tmp/repaired

In the latter
case, atopcat reports that the input file is
incomplete and stops after the last consistent sample.
