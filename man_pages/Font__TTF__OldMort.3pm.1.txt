NAME
       Font::TTF::OldMort - Glyph Metamorphosis table in a font

DESCRIPTION
INSTANCE VARIABLES
       version
           table version number (Fixed: currently 1.0)

       chains
           list of metamorphosis chains, each of which has its own fields:

           defaultFlags
               chain's default subfeature flags (UInt32)

           featureEntries
               list of feature entries, each of which has fields:

               type
               setting
               enable
               disable
           subtables
               list of metamorphosis subtables, each of which has fields:

               type
                   subtable type (0: rearrangement; 1: contextual
                   substitution; 2: ligature; 4: non-contextual substitution;
                   5: insertion)

               direction
                   processing direction ('LR' or 'RL')

               orientation
                   applies to text in which orientation ('VH', 'V', or 'H')

               subFeatureFlags
                   the subfeature flags controlling whether the table is used
                   (UInt32)

               Further fields depend on the type of subtable:

                   Rearrangement table:

                   classes
                       array of lists of glyphs

                   states
                       array of arrays of hashes{'nextState', 'flags'}

                   Contextual substitution table:

                   classes
                       array of lists of glyphs

                   states
                       array of array of hashes{'nextState', 'flags',
                       'actions'}, where "actions" is an array of two elements
                       which are offsets to be added to [marked, current]
                       glyph to get index into "mappings" (or "undef" if no
                       mapping to be applied)

                   mappings
                       list of glyph codes mapped to through the state table
                       mappings

                   Ligature table:

                   Non-contextual substitution table:

                   Insertion table:

METHODS
   $t->read
       Reads the table into memory

   $t->out($fh)
       Writes the table to a file either from memory or by copying

   $t->print($fh)
       Prints a human-readable representation of the table
