NAME

nbd_get_version
- return the version of the library

SYNOPSIS

#include

const char * nbd_get_version ( 
struct nbd_handle *h 
);

DESCRIPTION

Return the
version of libnbd. This is returned as a string in the form
"major.minor.release" where each of major, minor
and release is a small positive integer. For example:

minor 
&darr; 
"1.0.3" 
&uarr; &uarr; 
major release 
major = 0

The major number was 0 for the
early experimental versions of libnbd where we still had an
unstable API.

major = 1

The major number is 1 for the
versions of libnbd with a long-term stable API and ABI. It
is not anticipated that major will be any number other than
1.

minor = 0, 2, ... (even)

The minor number is even for
stable releases.

minor = 1, 3, ... (odd)

The minor number is odd for
development versions. Note that new APIs added in a
development version remain experimental and subject to
change in that branch until they appear in a stable
release.

release

The release number is
incremented for each release along a particular branch.

RETURN VALUE

This call
returns a statically allocated string, valid for the
lifetime of the process or until libnbd is unloaded by
dlclose(3). You must not try to free the
string.

ERRORS

This function
does not fail.

The following
parameters must not be NULL: "h". For more
information see "Non-NULL parameters" in
libnbd(3).

VERSION

This function
first appeared in libnbd 1.0.

If you need to
test if this function is available at compile time check if
the following macro is defined:

#define
LIBNBD_HAVE_NBD_GET_VERSION 1
