PTHREAD_ATTR_GETSCHEDPARAM(POSIXXProgrammer'PTHREAD_ATTR_GETSCHEDPARAM(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       pthread_attr_getschedparam, pthread_attr_setschedparam —  get  and  set
       the schedparam attribute

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pthread.h>

       int pthread_attr_getschedparam(const pthread_attr_t *restrict attr,
           struct sched_param *restrict param);
       int pthread_attr_setschedparam(pthread_attr_t *restrict attr,
           const struct sched_param *restrict param);

DESCRIPTION
       The pthread_attr_getschedparam() and pthread_attr_setschedparam() func‐
       tions, respectively, shall get and set  the  scheduling  parameter  at‐
       tributes  in the attr argument. The contents of the param structure are
       defined in the <sched.h> header. For the SCHED_FIFO and SCHED_RR  poli‐
       cies, the only required member of param is sched_priority.

       For the SCHED_SPORADIC policy, the required members of the param struc‐
       ture are sched_priority,  sched_ss_low_priority,  sched_ss_repl_period,
       sched_ss_init_budget,    and    sched_ss_max_repl.     The    specified
       sched_ss_repl_period must be greater than or  equal  to  the  specified
       sched_ss_init_budget  for  the  function to succeed; if it is not, then
       the function shall fail. The value of sched_ss_max_repl shall be within
       the  inclusive  range [1,{SS_REPL_MAX}] for the function to succeed; if
       not,  the  function  shall  fail.   It  is  unspecified   whether   the
       sched_ss_repl_period and sched_ss_init_budget values are stored as pro‐
       vided by this function or are rounded to align with the  resolution  of
       the clock being used.

       The  behavior  is undefined if the value specified by the attr argument
       to pthread_attr_getschedparam()  or  pthread_attr_setschedparam()  does
       not refer to an initialized thread attributes object.

RETURN VALUE
       If      successful,      the      pthread_attr_getschedparam()      and
       pthread_attr_setschedparam() functions shall return zero; otherwise, an
       error number shall be returned to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The pthread_attr_setschedparam() function shall fail if:

       ENOTSUP
              An  attempt  was  made  to  set  the attribute to an unsupported
              value.

       The pthread_attr_setschedparam() function may fail if:

       EINVAL The value of param is not valid.

       These functions shall not return an error code of [EINTR].

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       After these attributes have been set, a thread can be created with  the
       specified attributes using pthread_create().  Using these routines does
       not affect the current running thread.

RATIONALE
       If an implementation detects that the value specified by the attr argu‐
       ment  to  pthread_attr_getschedparam()  or pthread_attr_setschedparam()
       does not refer to an initialized thread attributes object, it is recom‐
       mended that the function should fail and report an [EINVAL] error.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
