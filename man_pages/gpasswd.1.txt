名称
       gpasswd - administer /etc/group and /etc/gshadow

大纲
       gpasswd [选项] group

描述
       The gpasswd command is used to administer /etc/group, and /etc/gshadow.
       Every group can have administrators, members and a password.

       System administrators can use the -A option to define group
       administrator(s) and the -M option to define members. They have all
       rights of group administrators and members.

       gpasswd called by a group administrator with a group name only prompts
       for the new password of the group.

       If a password is set the members can still use newgrp(1) without a
       password, and non-members must supply the password.

   请注意组密码
       Group passwords are an inherent security problem since more than one
       person is permitted to know the password. However, groups are a useful
       tool for permitting co-operation between different users.

选项
       Except for the -A and -M options, the options cannot be combined.

       The options which apply to the gpasswd command are:

       -a, --add user
           Add the user to the named group.

       -d, --delete user
           Remove the user from the named group.

       -h, --help
           显示帮助信息并退出。

       -Q, --root CHROOT_DIR
           Apply changes in the CHROOT_DIR directory and use the configuration
           files from the CHROOT_DIR directory. Only absolute paths are
           supported.

       -r, --remove-password
           Remove the password from the named group. The group password will
           be empty. Only group members will be allowed to use newgrp to join
           the named group.

       -R, --restrict
           Restrict the access to the named group. The group password is set
           to "!". Only group members with a password will be allowed to use
           newgrp to join the named group.

       -A, --administrators user,...
           设置有管理权限的用户列表。

       -M, --members user,...
           设置组成员列表。

CAVEATS
       This tool only operates on the /etc/group and /etc/gshadow files.  Thus
       you cannot change any NIS or LDAP group. This must be performed on the
       corresponding server.

配置文件
       The following configuration variables in /etc/login.defs change the
       behavior of this tool:
