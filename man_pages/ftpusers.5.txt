NAME
       ftpusers - list of users that may not log in via the FTP daemon

DESCRIPTION
       The text file ftpusers contains a list of users that may not log in us‐
       ing the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server daemon.  This file is  used
       not  merely  for  system administration purposes but also for improving
       security within a TCP/IP networked environment.

       The ftpusers file will typically contain a list of the users  that  ei‐
       ther  have  no business using ftp or have too many privileges to be al‐
       lowed to log in through the FTP server daemon.  Such users usually  in‐
       clude root, daemon, bin, uucp, and news.

       If  your  FTP  server daemon doesn't use ftpusers, then it is suggested
       that you read its documentation to find out how  to  block  access  for
       certain  users.   Washington  University FTP server Daemon (wuftpd) and
       Professional FTP Daemon (proftpd) are known to make use of ftpusers.

   Format
       The format of ftpusers is very simple.  There is one account  name  (or
       username) per line.  Lines starting with a # are ignored.

FILES
       /etc/ftpusers
