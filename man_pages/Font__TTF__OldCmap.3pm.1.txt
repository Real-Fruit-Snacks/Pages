NAME
       Font::TTF::OldCmap - Character map table

       This module is deprecated

DESCRIPTION
       Looks after the character map. The primary structure used for handling
       a cmap is the Font::TTF::Segarr which handles the segmented arrays of
       format 4 tables, and in a simpler form for format 0 tables.

       Due to the complexity of working with segmented arrays, most of the
       handling of such arrays is via methods rather than via instance
       variables.

       One important feature of a format 4 table is that it always contains a
       segment with a final address of 0xFFFF. If you are creating a table
       from scratch this is important (although Font::TTF::Segarr can work
       quite happily without it).

INSTANCE VARIABLES
       The instance variables listed here are not preceded by a space due to
       their emulating structural information in the font.

       Num Number of subtables in this table

       Tables
           An array of subtables ([0..Num-1])

       Each subtables also has its own instance variables which are, again,
       not preceded by a space.

       Platform
           The platform number for this subtable

       Encoding
           The encoding number for this subtable

       Format
           Gives the stored format of this subtable

       Ver Gives the version (or language) information for this subtable

       val This points to a Font::TTF::Segarr which contains the content of
           the particular subtable.

METHODS
   $t->read
       Reads the cmap into memory. Format 4 subtables read the whole subtable
       and fill in the segmented array accordingly.

       Format 2 subtables are not read at all.

   $t->ms_lookup($uni)
       Given a Unicode value in the MS table (Platform 3, Encoding 1) locates
       that table and looks up the appropriate glyph number from it.

   $t->find_ms
       Finds the Microsoft Unicode table and sets the "mstable" instance
       variable to it if found. Returns the table it finds.

   $t->out($fh)
       Writes out a cmap table to a filehandle. If it has not been read, then
       just copies from input file to output

   @map = $t->reverse([$num])
       Returns a reverse map of the table of given number or the Microsoft
       cmap. I.e. given a glyph gives the Unicode value for it.

BUGS
       â€¢   No support for format 2 tables (MBCS)
