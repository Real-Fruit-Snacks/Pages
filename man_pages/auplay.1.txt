auplay - play a
sound file to a Network Audio System server

SYNOPSIS

auplay
[-audio servername] [-volume 0-100] [-i] [-I]
[-l] files...

DESCRIPTION

The
auplay program can be used to play audio data stored
in the .SND, .AU, or .WAV formats common on Sun workstations
and PCs. It is typically used from shell scripts or command
line procedures. If no filenames are given on the command
line, audio data will be read fron stdin, unless the
-l option is given.

OPTIONS

The following
options may be used with the auplay program: 
-audio servername

This option specifies the
Network Audio System server on which the files should be
played.

-volume 0-100

This option specifies the
volume at which the data should be played as a percentage of
the maximum possible volume. The default is 100 percent.

-i

This option indicates that the header information
associated with the sound data should be printed along with
playing the data.

-I

This option indicates that the header information
associated with the sound data should be printed instead of
playing the data.

-l

This option indicates that a list of filenames is to be
read from stdin. auplay will play these files after
playing any files given explicitly as command line
arguments.
