NAME

osinfo-db-import
- Import an osinfo database archive

SYNOPSIS

osinfo-db-import
[OPTIONS...] [ARCHIVE-FILE]

DESCRIPTION

The
osinfo-db-import tool will take an osinfo database
archive and extract its contents into one of the standard
database locations on the current host: 
system

This is the primary system-wide
database location, intended for use by operating system
vendors distributing database files in the native package
format.

local

This is the secondary
system-wide database location, intended for use by system
administrators wishing to provide an updated database for
all users.

user

This is the user private
database location, intended for use by unprivileged local
users wishing to provide applications they use with an
updated database.

If run by a
privileged account (ie root), the local database
location will be used by default, otherwise the user
location will be used.

When passing a
non local ARCHIVE-FILE, only http:// and https:// protocols
are supported.

With no
ARCHIVE-FILE, or when ARCHIVE-FILE is -, read standard
input.
