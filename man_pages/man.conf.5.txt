NAME

man.conf
- configuration file for man

DESCRIPTION

This is the
configuration file for the man(1), apropos(1), and
makewhatis(8) utilities. Its presence, and all directives,
are optional.

This file is an
ASCII text file. Leading whitespace on lines, lines starting
with &rsquo;#&rsquo;, and blank lines are ignored. Words are
separated by whitespace. The first word on each line is the
name of a configuration directive.

The following
directives are supported: 
manpath path

Override the default search
path for man(1), apropos(1), and makewhatis(8). It
can be used multiple times to specify multiple paths, with
the order determining the manual page search order.

Each path is a
tree containing subdirectories whose names consist of the
strings &rsquo;man&rsquo; and/or &rsquo;cat&rsquo; followed
by the names of sections, usually single digits. The former
are supposed to contain unformatted manual pages in mdoc(7)
and/or man(7) format; file names should end with the name of
the section preceded by a dot. The latter should contain
preformatted manual pages; file names should end with
&rsquo;.0&rsquo;.

Creating a
mandoc.db(5) database with makewhatis(8) in each directory
configured with manpath is recommended and necessary
for apropos(1) to work, and also for man(1) on operating
systems like OpenBSD that install each manual page with only
one file name in the file system, even if it documents
multiple utilities or functions.

output option
[value]

Configure the default value of
an output option. These directives are overridden by the
-O command line options of the same names. For
details, see the mandoc(1) manual.

FILES

/etc/man.conf

EXAMPLES

The following configuration
file reproduces the defaults: installing it is equivalent to
not having a man.conf file at all.

manpath
/usr/share/man 
manpath /usr/X11R6/man 
manpath /usr/local/man

SEE ALSO

apropos(1),
man(1), makewhatis(8)

HISTORY

A relatively
complicated man.conf file format first appeared in
4.3BSD-Reno. For OpenBSD 5.8, it was redesigned from
scratch, aiming for simplicity.
