APPLICATION USAGE
       This utility is typically used in shell scripts, as shown in the  EXAM‐
       PLES  section.  The  special built-in utility : is sometimes more effi‐
       cient than true.

EXAMPLES
       This command is executed forever:

           while true
           do
               command
           done

RATIONALE
       The true utility has been retained in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017, even
       though the shell special built-in : provides similar functionality, be‐
       cause true is widely used in historical scripts and is less cryptic  to
       novice script readers.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
