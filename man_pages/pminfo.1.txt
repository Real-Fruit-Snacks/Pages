pminfo -
display information about performance metrics

SYNOPSIS

pminfo
[-dfFIlLmMstTvVxz?] [-a archive]
[-b batchsize] [-c dmfile]
[--container name] [-h hostname]
[-K spec] [-[n|N]
pmnsfile] [-O time] [-Z
timezone] [metricname | pmid |
indom]...

DESCRIPTION

pminfo
displays various types of information about performance
metrics available through the facilities of the Performance
Co-Pilot (PCP).

The metrics of
interest are named in the metricname arguments. If
metricname is a non-leaf node in the PMNS, then
pminfo will recursively descend the PMNS and report
on all leaf nodes. If no metricname argument is
given, the root of the PMNS is used.

If the
metricname argument is in numeric dotted notation, it
is interpreted as either a 3-dotted pmid (metric
identifier - domain, cluster, item numbers) or a 2-dotted
indom (instance domain identifier - domain, serial
number). In the pmid case, a reverse PMID-to-name
lookup is performed, and in the indom case, the
instance domain is reported directly. This latter mode can
be used to report the instance domain ’’one
line’’ and long form help text summaries.

Unless directed
to another host by the -h option, by default
pminfo will contact the Performance Metrics Collector
Daemon (PMCD) on the local host. The connection to a PMCD is
only required if pminfo requires distributed PMNS
information, and/or meta-data describing metrics, and/or
metric values, and/or help text.

The -a
option causes pminfo to use the specified set of
archives rather than connecting to a PMCD.

The -L
option causes pminfo to use a local context to
collect metrics from PMDAs on the local host without PMCD.
Only some metrics are available in this mode.

The -a,
-h and -L options are mutually exclusive.

OPTIONS

The available
command line options are: 
-a archive, --archive=archive

Performance metric values are
retrieved from the set of Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) archive
files identified by the archive argument, which is a
comma-separated list of names, each of which may be the base
name of an archive or the name of a directory containing one
or more archives.

-b, --batch

This option may be used to
define the maximum number of metrics to be fetched in a
single request for the -f and -v options. The
default value for batchsize is 128.

-c dmfile,
--derived=dmfile

The dmfile argument
specifies a file that contains derived metric definitions in
the format described for pmLoadDerivedConfig(3). The
-c option provides a way to load derived metric
definitions that is an alternative to the more generic use
of the PCP_DERIVED_CONFIG environment variable as
described in PCPIntro(1). Using the -c option
and the PCP_DERIVED_CONFIG environment variable to
specify the same configuration is a bad idea, so
choose one or the other method.

--container=container

Specify an individual
container to be queried.

-d, --desc

Metric descriptions detailing
the PMID, data type, data semantics, units, scale and
associated instance domain.

-f, --fetch

Fetch and print values for all
instances. When fetching from a set of archives, only those
instances present in the first archive record for a metric
will be displayed; see also the -O option, else use
pmdumplog(1) which may be a better tool for examining
archives.

-F,
--fetchall

Same as -f but try
harder to fetch instances for metrics which have
non-enumerable instance domains (e.g. metrics in the
’’proc’’ subtree of the default PMNS
on some platforms).

-h host,
--host=host

Fetch performance metrics from
pmcd(1) on host, rather than from the default
localhost.

-I,
--fullindom

Print the InDom in verbose
mode.

-K spec,
--spec-local=spec

When using the -L/
option to fetch metrics from a local context, this option
controls the DSO PMDAs that should be made accessible. The
spec argument conforms to the syntax described in
pmSpecLocalPMDA(3). More than one -K option
may be used.

-l, --labels

Print label sets associated
with metrics and instances. Labels are optional metric
metadata described in detail in
pmLookupLabels(3).

-L,
--local-PMDA

Use a local context to collect
metrics from DSO PMDAs on the local host without PMCD. See
also -K.

-m, --pmid

Print the PMID in terse
mode.

-M,
--fullpmid

Print the PMID in verbose
mode.

-n pmnsfile,
--namespace=pmnsfile

Normally pminfo operates
on the distributed Performance Metrics Name Space (PMNS),
however if the -n option is specified an alternative
local PMNS is loaded from the file pmnsfile.

-N pmnsfile,
--uniqnames=pmnsfile

The -N option supports
the same function as -n, except for the handling of
duplicate names for the same Performance Metric Identifier
(PMID) in pmnsfile - duplicate names are allowed with
-n but they are not allowed with -N.

-O time,
--origin=time

When used in conjunction with
an archive source of metrics and the options -f/, the
time argument defines a time origin at which the
metrics should be fetched from the set of archives. Refer to
PCPIntro(1) for a complete description of this
option, and the syntax for the time argument.

-s, --series

Print time series identifiers
associated with metrics, instances and sources. These unique
identifiers are calculated from intrinsic (non-optional)
labels and other metric metadata associated with each PMAPI
context (sources), metrics and instances. Archive, local
context or pmcd(1) connections for the same host all
produce the same source identifier. See also
pmLookupLabels(3) and the -l option.

-t, --oneline

Print the ’’one
line’’ help summary, if available.

-T,
--helptext

Print the help text, if
available.

-v, --verify

Verify mode in which
descriptions and values are retrieved, but only error
conditions are reported. This option silently disables any
output from the options -f/--fetch,
-l/--labels, -I/--fullindom,
-M/--fullpmid, -m/--pmid,
-t/--oneline and
-T/--helptext.

-V, --version

Display version number and
exit.

-x, --events

Like the
-f/--fetch option, but with the additional
functionality that if a value is processed that is of type
PM_TYPE_EVENT or PM_TYPE_HIGHRES_EVENT, then the event
records will be unpacked and the details of each event
record reported.

-z,
--hostzone

Change the reporting timezone
to the local timezone at the host that is the source of the
performance metrics, as identified via either the -h
or -a options.

-Z timezone,
--timezone=timezone

By default, pminfo
reports the time of day according to the local timezone on
the system where pminfo is run. The -Z option
changes the timezone to timezone in the format of the
environment variable TZ as described in
environ(7).

-?, --help

Display usage message and
exit.

FILES

$PCP_VAR_DIR/pmns/*

default local PMNS
specification files

PCP ENVIRONMENT

Environment
variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On
each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains
the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).

For environment
variables affecting PCP tools, see
pmGetOptions(3).
