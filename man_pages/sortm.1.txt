sortm - sort
nmh messages

SYNOPSIS

sortm

[-help] [-version]
[+folder] [msgs] [-all | -noall]
[-datefield field] [-textfield
field] [-notextfield] [-limit
days] [-nolimit] [-check |
-nocheck] [-verbose | -noverbose]

DESCRIPTION

sortm
sorts the specified messages in the named folder according
to the chronological order of the &ldquo;Date:&rdquo; field
of each message.

If no messages
are specified, the default is all messages in the folder.
However, if no messages are specified and the -noall
switch is enabled, then sortm reports that as an
error and exits with non-zero status. -noall is most
useful in the user&rsquo;s profile, to avoid inadvertent
sorting of an entire folder. The -all switch can then
be used on the command line to disable it. Of course, a
message specification of all can be used in any
case.

The
-verbose switch directs sortm to tell the user
the general actions that it is taking to place the folder in
sorted order.

The
-datefield field switch tells sortm the
name of the field to use when making the date comparison. If
the user has a special field in each message, such as
&ldquo;BB-Posted:&rdquo; or &ldquo;Delivery-Date:&rdquo;,
then the -datefield switch can be used to direct
sortm which field to examine.

The
-textfield field switch causes sortm to
sort messages by the specified text field. All characters
except letters and numbers are stripped and the resulting
strings are sorted datefield-major, textfield-minor, using a
case insensitive comparison. If this field is
&ldquo;subject&rdquo;, any leading "re:" is
stripped off.

With
-textfield field, if -limit days
is specified, messages with the same textfields that are
dated within &rsquo;days&rsquo; of each other appear
together. Specifying -nolimit makes the limit
infinity. With -limit 0, the sort is instead
simply textfield-major.

For example, to
order a folder by date-major, grouping messages with the
same subject on the same date together, use:

sortm
-textfield subject +folder

sortm
always issues a warning for each message that is missing a
&ldquo;Date:&rdquo; field, has a &ldquo;Date:&rdquo; field
that cannot be parsed, or has a format error in any header
field. With the -check switch, sortm inhibits
all modifications to the folder if there are any such
messages, and exits with non-zero status. With the default
of -nocheck, sortm sorts messages with a
missing or invalid &ldquo;Date:&rdquo; field using their
file modification times.

When ordering
messages based on their dates, if they have the same dates,
their original message order is preserved.

DEFAULTS

&rsquo;+folder&rsquo;
defaults to the current folder 
&rsquo;msgs&rsquo; defaults to all without -noall,
has no default with -noall 
&rsquo;-all&rsquo; 
&rsquo;-datefield&rsquo; defaults to date 
&rsquo;-notextfield&rsquo; 
&rsquo;-noverbose&rsquo; 
&rsquo;-nolimit&rsquo; 
&rsquo;-nocheck&rsquo;

CONTEXT

If a folder is
given, it will become the current folder. If the current
message is moved, sortm will preserve its status as
current.

HISTORY

Timezones used
to be ignored when comparing dates: they aren&rsquo;t any
more.

Messages which
were in the folder, but not specified by &rsquo;msgs&rsquo;,
used to be moved to the end of the folder; now such messages
are left untouched.

sortm
sometimes did not preserve the message numbering in a folder
(e.g., messages 1, 3, and 5, might have been renumbered to
1, 2, 3 after sorting). This was a bug, and has been fixed.
To compress the message numbering in a folder, use
&ldquo;folder -pack&rdquo; as always.

BUGS

When
sortm complains about a message which it can&rsquo;t
temporally order, it complains about the message number
prior to sorting. It should indicate what the message
number will be after sorting.
