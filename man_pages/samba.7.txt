NAME
       samba - A Windows AD and SMB/CIFS fileserver for UNIX

SYNOPSIS
       samba

DESCRIPTION
       The Samba software suite is a collection of programs that implements
       the Server Message Block (commonly abbreviated as SMB) protocol for
       UNIX systems and provides Active Directory services. The first version
       of the SMB protocol is sometimes also referred to as the Common
       Internet File System (CIFS). For a more thorough description, see
       http://www.ubiqx.org/cifs/. Samba also implements the NetBIOS protocol
       in nmbd.

       samba(8)
           The samba daemon provides the Active Directory services and file
           and print services to SMB clients. The configuration file for this
           daemon is described in smb.conf(5).

       smbd(8)
           The smbd daemon provides the file and print services to SMB
           clients. The configuration file for this daemon is described in
           smb.conf(5).

       nmbd(8)
           The nmbd daemon provides NetBIOS nameservice and browsing support.
           The configuration file for this daemon is described in smb.conf(5).

       winbindd(8)
           winbindd is a daemon that is used for integrating authentication
           and the user database into unix.

       smbclient(1)
           The smbclient program implements a simple ftp-like client. This is
           useful for accessing SMB shares on other compatible SMB servers,
           and can also be used to allow a UNIX box to print to a printer
           attached to any SMB server.

       samba-tool(8)
           The samba-tool is the main Samba Administration tool regarding
           Active Directory services.

       testparm(1)
           The testparm utility is a simple syntax checker for Samba's
           smb.conf(5) configuration file. In AD server mode samba-tool
           testparm should be used though.

       smbstatus(1)
           The smbstatus tool provides access to information about the current
           connections to smbd.

       nmblookup(1)
           The nmblookup tool allows NetBIOS name queries to be made.

       smbpasswd(8)
           The smbpasswd command is a tool for setting passwords on local
           Samba but also on remote SMB servers.

       smbcacls(1)
           The smbcacls command is a tool to set ACL's on remote SMB servers.

       smbtree(1)
           The smbtree command is a text-based network neighborhood tool.

       smbtar(1)
           The smbtar can make backups of data directly from SMB servers.

       smbspool(8)
           smbspool is a helper utility for printing on printers connected to
           SMB servers.

       smbcontrol(1)
           smbcontrol is a utility that can change the behaviour of running
           samba, smbd, nmbd and winbindd daemons.

       rpcclient(1)
           rpcclient is a utility that can be used to execute RPC commands on
           remote SMB servers.

       pdbedit(8)
           The pdbedit command can be used to maintain the local user database
           on a Samba server.

       net(8)
           The net command is the main administration tool for Samba member
           and standalone servers.

       wbinfo(1)
           wbinfo is a utility that retrieves and stores information related
           to winbind.

       profiles(1)
           profiles is a command-line utility that can be used to replace all
           occurrences of a certain SID with another SID.

       log2pcap(1)
           log2pcap is a utility for generating pcap trace files from Samba
           log files.

       vfstest(1)
           vfstest is a utility that can be used to test vfs modules.

       ntlm_auth(1)
           ntlm_auth is a helper-utility for external programs wanting to do
           NTLM-authentication.

       smbcquotas(1)
           smbcquotas is a tool to manage quotas on remote SMB servers.

COMPONENTS
       The Samba suite is made up of several components. Each component is
       described in a separate manual page. It is strongly recommended that
       you read the documentation that comes with Samba and the manual pages
       of those components that you use. If the manual pages and documents
       aren't clear enough then please visit https://devel.samba.org for
       information on how to file a bug report or submit a patch.

       If you require help, visit the Samba webpage at https://www.samba.org/
       and explore the many option available to you.

CONTRIBUTIONS
       If you wish to contribute to the Samba project, then I suggest you join
       the Samba mailing list at https://lists.samba.org.

       If you have patches to submit, visit https://devel.samba.org/ for
       information on how to do it properly. We prefer patches in git

CONTRIBUTORS
       Contributors to the project are now too numerous to mention here but
       all deserve the thanks of all Samba users. To see a full list, look at
       the change-log in the source package for the pre-CVS changes and at
       https://git.samba.org/ for the contributors to Samba post-GIT. GIT is
       the Open Source source code control system used by the Samba Team to
       develop Samba. The project would have been unmanageable without it.

AUTHOR
       The original Samba software and related utilities were created by
       Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by the Samba Team as an Open
       Source project similar to the way the Linux kernel is developed.
