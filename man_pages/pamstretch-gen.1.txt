SYNOPSIS
       pamstretch-gen N [pnmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       pamstretch-gen is a program which uses pamstretch(1) and pamscale(1) to
       smoothly  scale  up a Netpbm image by any factor; it's like a more gen-
       eral version of pamstretch (hence the name).

       pamstretch-gen uses the -dropedge option on pamstretch.

OPTIONS
       There are no command line options defined specifically for  pamstretch-
       gen, but it recognizes the options common to all programs based on lib-
       netpbm (See
        Common Options <index.html#commonoptions> .)

       The Netpbm global options -quiet and  -plain  did  not  exist  on  pam-
       stretch-gen  prior  to version 10.86 (March 2019).  -quiet did not work
       until version 10.91 (June 2020).
