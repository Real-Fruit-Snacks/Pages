NAME
       Image::ExifTool::WritePostScript.pl - Write PostScript meta information

SYNOPSIS
       This file is autoloaded by Image::ExifTool::PostScript.

DESCRIPTION
       This file contains routines to write meta information in PostScript
       documents.  Six forms of meta information may be written:

           1) PostScript comments (Adobe DSC specification)
           2) XMP information embedded in a document-level XMP stream
           3) EXIF information embedded in a Photoshop record
           4) IPTC information embedded in a PhotoShop record
           5) ICC_Profile information embedded in an ICCProfile record
           6) TIFF information embedded in DOS-style binary header

NOTES
       Currently, information is written only in the outer-level document.

       Photoshop will discard meta information in a PostScript document if it
       has to rasterize the image, and it will rasterize anything that doesn't
       contain the Photoshop-specific 'ImageData' tag.  So don't expect
       Photoshop to read any meta information added to EPS images that it
       didn't create.

       The following two acronyms may be confusing since they are so similar
       and have different meanings with respect to PostScript documents:

           DSC = Document Structuring Conventions
           DCS = Desktop Color Separation
