PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       difftime — compute the difference between two calendar time values

SYNOPSIS
       #include <time.h>

       double difftime(time_t time1, time_t time0);

DESCRIPTION
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with  the
       ISO C  standard.  Any  conflict between the requirements described here
       and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017
       defers to the ISO C standard.

       The difftime() function shall compute the difference between two calen‐
       dar times (as returned by time()): time1- time0.

RETURN VALUE
       The difftime() function shall return the difference expressed  in  sec‐
       onds as a type double.

ERRORS
       No errors are defined.
