NAME
       ilbmtoppm - convert an ILBM file into a PPM image

SYNOPSIS
       ilbmtoppm  [-ignore<chunkID>] [ -isham | -isnotham | -isehb | -isnotehb
       | -isdeep |  -isnotdeep  ]  [-cmaponly]  [-adjustcolors]  [-transparent
       color] [-maskfile filename [-verbose] [ILBMfile]

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       ilbmtoppm  reads  an IFF ILBM file as input and produces a PPM image as
       output.  ilbmtoppm can handle the following ILBM types:

       •      Normal ILBMs with 1-16 planes.

       •      Amiga Extra_Halfbrite (EHB)

       •      Amiga HAM with 3-16 planes.

       •      24 bit.

       •      Multiplatte (normal or HAM) pictures.

       •      Color map (BMHD + CMAP chunk only, nPlanes = 0).

       •      Unofficial direct color.  1-16 planes for each color component.

       ilbmtoppm uses these ILBM chunks: BMHD, CMAP,  CAMG  (only  HAM  &  EHB
       flags  used), PCHG, BODY unofficial DCOL chunk to identify direct color
       ILBM.  It ignores these chunks: GRAB, DEST,  SPRT,  CRNG,  CCRT,  CLUT,
       DPPV,  DRNG,  EPSF.   It  ignores, but displays in verbose mode, these:
       NAME, AUTH, (c), ANNO, DPI.  It skips chunks whose type it doesn't rec‐
       ognize.

OPTIONS
       In  addition  to  the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm
       (most notably -quiet, see
        Common Options ⟨index.html#commonoptions⟩ ), ilbmtoppm recognizes  the
       following command line options:

       -transparent color
              This is the color that should "show through" in places where the
              image is transparent.

              color is like  the  argument  of  the  pnm_parsecolor()  library
              routine ⟨libnetpbm_image.html#colorname⟩ .

       -verbose
              Give some information about the ILBM file.

       -ignore chunkID
              Skip  a  chunk.  chunkID is the 4-letter IFF chunk identifier of
              the chunk to be skipped.

       -isham | -isehb
              Treat the input file as a HAM or Extra_Halfbrite  picture,  even
              if  these flags are not set in the CAMG chunk (or if there is no
              CAMG chunk).

       -maskfile filename
              This names a file for  ilbmtoppm  to  create  with  the  image's
              transparency  mask.   The mask file is a PBM image which maps to
              the input image with white pixels representing transparent  pix‐
              els in the image and black pixels representing opaque pixels.

              If  you  don't specfy this, or the image does not contain trans‐
              parency information, ilbmtoppm does not create a mask file.

       -cmaponly
              With this option, ilbmtoppm generates a PPM of the ILBM's  color
              map, not the image itself.

              ilbmtoppm does the same thing even without -cmaponly if the ILBM
              is a pure color map stream (it  has  a  bitmap  header  with  an
              nplanes value of zero or has no BODY chunk.

       -adjustcolors
              If  all  colors  in the CMAP have a value of less then 16, ilbm‐
              toppm assumes a 4-bit colormap and gives a warning.   With  this
              option the colormap is scaled to 8 bits.

LIMITATIONS
       The  multipalette PCHG BigLineChanges and Huffman decompression code is
       untested.
