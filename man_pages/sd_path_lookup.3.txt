DESCRIPTION

sd_path_lookup()
and sd_bus_path_lookup_strv() return a single path or
set of file system paths specified by the argument
type. In case of sd_path_lookup() a single
NUL-terminated string is returned. When type
specifies a set of paths, they are concatenated using
":" as a separator (as is traditionally done for
e.g. $PATH or $LD_LIBRARY_PATH). In case of
sd_path_lookup_strv() a NULL-terminated array
of strings is returned (strv). If suffix suffix is
given, it is concatenated to each of the paths after a slash
("/"). All returned paths are absolute.

For paths which
refer to user directories, the relevant XDG standard is
followed, with support for environment variables like
$XDG_DOCUMENTS_DIR, $XDG_DESKTOP_DIR, ..., and
explicit configuration in /etc/xdg/user-dirs.conf or
${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/user-dirs.dirs. See
XDG Base Directory
Specification
[1]
for details.

systemd-path(1)
is a wrapper around sd_path_lookup() and allows the
same set of paths to be queried.

RETURN VALUE

On
success, sd_path_lookup() and
sd_path_lookup_strv() return a non-negative integer.
On failure, a negative errno-style error number is returned
by either function.

The
returned string or string array (strv) must be
free(3)'d by the caller.

Errors

Returned errors may indicate the following
problems:

-EOPNOTSUPP

Unknown
identifier type.

Added
in version 246.

-EINVAL

Output
argument is NULL.

Added
in version 246.

-ENXIO

Query
failed because of an undefined environment variable (e.g.
for SD_PATH_USER_RUNTIME when $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR
is not defined).

Added
in version 246.

-ENOMEM

Memory
allocation failed.

Added
in version 246.

EXAMPLES

Look
up the location of ~/Documents

#include

#include 

int
main(void) { 
int r; 
char *t;

r
= sd_path_lookup(SD_PATH_USER_DOCUMENTS, NULL, &t); 
if (r 
return EXIT_FAILURE;

printf("~/Documents:
%s\n", t); 
free(t);

return
EXIT_SUCCESS; 
}

Note
that the default answer of $HOME/Documents may be overridden
by user-dirs.conf or $XDG_DOCUMENTS_DIR.

NOTES

Functions
described here are available as a shared library, which can
be compiled against and linked to with the
libsystemd pkg-config(1) file.

The
code described here uses getenv(3), which is declared
to be not multi-thread-safe. This means that the code
calling the functions described here must not call
setenv(3) from a parallel thread. It is recommended
to only do calls to setenv() from an early phase of
the program when no other threads have been
started.

HISTORY

sd_path_lookup()
and sd_path_lookup_strv() were added in version
246.
