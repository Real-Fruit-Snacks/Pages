DESCRIPTION

Open vSwitch
daemons accept certain commands at runtime to control their
behavior and query their settings. Every daemon accepts a
common set of commands documented under Common
Commands below. Some daemons support additional commands
documented in their own manpages. ovs-vswitchd in
particular accepts a number of additional commands
documented in ovs-vswitchd(8).

The
ovs-appctl program provides a simple way to invoke
these commands. The command to be sent is specified on
ovs-appctl’s command line as non-option
arguments. ovs-appctl sends the command and prints
the daemon’s response on standard output.

In normal use
only a single option is accepted:

•

-t  or --target

Tells
ovs-appctl which daemon to contact.

If
 begins with / it must name a Unix
domain socket on which an Open vSwitch daemon is listening
for control channel connections. By default, each daemon
listens on a Unix domain socket in the rundir (e.g.
/run) named ..ctl,
where  is the program’s name and
 is its process ID. For example, if
ovs-vswitchd has PID 123, it would listen on
ovs-vswitchd.123.ctl.

Otherwise,
ovs-appctl looks in the rundir for a pidfile, that
is, a file whose contents are the process ID of a running
process as a decimal number, named
.pid. (The --pidfile option
makes an Open vSwitch daemon create a pidfile.)
ovs-appctl reads the pidfile, then looks in the
rundir for a Unix socket named
..ctl, where  is
replaced by the process ID read from the pidfile, and uses
that file as if it had been specified directly as the
target.

On Windows,
 can be an absolute path to a file that
contains a localhost TCP port on which an Open vSwitch
daemon is listening for control channel connections. By
default, each daemon writes the TCP port on which it is
listening for control connection into the file
.ctl located inside the rundir. If
 is not an absolute path, ovs-appctl
looks in the rundir for a file named
.ctl. The default target is
ovs-vswitchd.

•

-T  or
--timeout= 

By default, or
with a  of 0, ovs-appctl waits
forever to connect to the daemon and receive a response.
This option limits runtime to approximately 
seconds. If the timeout expires, ovs-appctl exits
with a SIGALRM signal.

COMMON COMMANDS

Every Open
vSwitch daemon supports a common set of commands, which are
documented in this section.

General
Commands 
These commands display daemon-specific commands and the
running version. Note that these commands are different from
the --help and --version options that return
information about the ovs-appctl utility itself.

•

list-commands

Lists the
commands supported by the target.

•

version

Displays the
version and compilation date of the target.

Logging
Commands 
Open vSwitch has several log levels. The highest-severity
log level is:

•

off

No message is
ever logged at this level, so setting a logging
destination’s log level to off disables logging
to that destination.

The following
log levels, in order of descending severity, are
available:

•

emer

A major failure
forced a process to abort.

•

err

A high-level
operation or a subsystem failed. Attention is warranted.

•

warn

A low-level
operation failed, but higher-level subsystems may be able to
recover.

•

info

Information
that may be useful in retrospect when investigating a
problem.

•

dbg

Information
useful only to someone with intricate knowledge of the
system, or that would commonly cause too-voluminous log
output. Log messages at this level are not logged by
default.

Every Open
vSwitch daemon supports the following commands for examining
and adjusting log levels:

•

vlog/list

Lists the known
logging modules and their current levels.

•

vlog/list-pattern

Lists logging
pattern used for each destination.

•

vlog/set
[] 

Sets logging
levels. Without any , sets the log level for
every module and destination to dbg. Otherwise,
 is a list of words separated by spaces or
commas or colons, up to one from each category below:

•

A valid module name, as
displayed by the vlog/list command on
ovs-appctl(8), limits the log level change to the
specified module.

•

syslog, console, or file, to limit
the log level change to only to the system log, to the
console, or to a file, respectively.

On Windows
platform, syslog is only useful if  was
started with the --syslog-target option (it has no
effect otherwise).

•

off, emer,
err, warn, info, or dbg, to
control the log level. Messages of the given severity or
higher will be logged, and messages of lower severity will
be filtered out. off filters out all messages.

Case is not
significant within .

Regardless of
the log levels set for file, logging to a file will
not take place unless the target application was invoked
with the --log-file option.

For
compatibility with older versions of OVS, any is
accepted within  but it has no effect.

•

vlog/set
PATTERN:: 

Sets the log
pattern for  to . Each
time a message is logged to ,
 determines the message’s formatting.
Most characters in  are copied literally to
the log, but special escapes beginning with % are
expanded as follows:

•

%A

The name of the
application logging the message, e.g.
ovs-vswitchd.

•

%B

The RFC5424
syslog PRI of the message.

•

%c

The name of the
module (as shown by ovs-appctl --list) logging the
message.

•

%d

The current
date and time in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS).

•

%d{}

The current
date and time in the specified , which takes
the same format as the  argument to
strftime(3). As an extension, any # characters
in  will be replaced by fractional seconds,
e.g. use %H:%M:%S.### for the time to the nearest
millisecond. Sub-second times are only approximate and
currently decimal places after the third will always be
reported as zero.

•

%D

The current UTC
date and time in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS).

•

%D{}

The current UTC
date and time in the specified , which takes
the same format as the  argument to
strftime``(3). Supports the same extension for sub-second
resolution as ``%d{...}.

•

%E

The hostname of
the node running the application.

•

%m

The message
being logged.

•

%N

A serial number
for this message within this run of the program, as a
decimal number. The first message a program logs has serial
number 1, the second one has serial number 2, and so on.

•

%n

A new-line.

•

%p

The level at
which the message is logged, e.g. DBG.

•

%P

The
program’s process ID (pid), as a decimal number.

•

%r

The number of
milliseconds elapsed from the start of the application to
the time the message was logged.

•

%t

The subprogram
name, that is, an identifying name for the process or thread
that emitted the log message, such as monitor for the
process used for --monitor or main for the
primary process or thread in a program.

•

%T

The subprogram
name enclosed in parentheses, e.g. (monitor), or the
empty string for the primary process or thread in a
program.

•

%%

A literal
%.

A few options
may appear between the % and the format specifier
character, in this order:

•

-

Left justify
the escape’s expansion within its field width. Right
justification is the default.

•

0

Pad the field
to the field width with 0 characters. Padding with
spaces is the default.

•

A number
specifies the minimum field width. If the escape expands to
fewer characters than  then it is padded to
fill the field width. (A field wider than  is
not truncated to fit.)

The default
pattern for console and file output is %D{%Y-%m-%dT
%H:%M:%SZ}|%05N|%c|%p|%m; for syslog output,
%05N|%c|%p|%m.

Daemons written
in Python (e.g. ovs-monitor-ipsec) do not allow
control over the log pattern.

•

vlog/set
FACILITY: 

Sets the
RFC5424 facility of the log message.  can be
one of kern, user, mail, daemon,
auth, syslog, lpr, news,
uucp, clock, ftp, ntp,
audit, alert, clock2, local0,
local1, local2, local3, local4,
local5, local6 or local7.

•

vlog/close

Causes the
daemon to close its log file, if it is open. (Use
vlog/reopen to reopen it later.)

•

vlog/reopen

Causes the
daemon to close its log file, if it is open, and then reopen
it. (This is useful after rotating log files, to cause a new
log file to be used.)

This has no
effect if the target application was not invoked with the
--log-file option.

OPTIONS

-h,
--help

Prints a brief help message to
the console.

-V, --version

Prints version information to
the console.
