NAME

pcp.env
- script to set Performance Co-Pilot run-time environment
variables

SYNOPSIS

/etc/pcp.env

DESCRIPTION

The
pcp.env script is sourced by assorted Performance
Co-Pilot (PCP) scripts and utilities to define the PCP
operating environment variables. The conjugate for
executable programs using the PCP libraries is the
__pmGetConfig(3) function.

Typical usage
of pcp.env in a script is as follows :

#! /bin/sh

# source the
PCP environment variables 
. /etc/pcp.env 
rest of script ...

The full syntax
and semantics of the pcp.conf file and the
__pmGetConfig function are described in their
respective reference pages.

If the file
$HOME/.pcp/pcp.conf exists then this will be
processed after the system-wide pcp.conf file. This
provides a mechanism to selectively modify or augment the
environment settings for PCP scripts, which maybe useful if
the scripts are run with sudo(1) which cleans the
environment of important settings that are required to
ensure the correct execution of the PCP scripts, e.g.
$PATH or $PERL5LIB.

ENVIRONMENT

The
PCP_CONF environment variable specifies an
alternative path to the pcp.conf file.
