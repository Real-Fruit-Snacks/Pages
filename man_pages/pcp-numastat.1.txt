NAME

pcp-numastat
- report on NUMA memory allocation

SYNOPSIS

pcp
[pcp options] numastat [-Vw?]

DESCRIPTION

pcp-numastat
displays NUMA allocation statistics from the kernel memory
allocator. Each process has NUMA policies that specify on
which node pages are allocated. The performance counters in
the kernel track on which nodes memory is allocated and
these values are sampled and reported by
pcp-numastat.

Counters are
maintained individually for each NUMA node. Details of the
semantics of each reported metric can be retrieved using the
following command:

# pminfo -dt
mem.numa.alloc

OPTIONS

When invoked
via the pcp(1) command, the -h/--host,
-a/--archive, -O/--origin,
-Z/--timezone and several other pcp
options become indirectly available; refer to
PCPIntro(1) for a complete description of these
options.

The additional
command line options available for pcp-numastat are:

-V, --version

Display the current version of
the command.

-w width,
--width=width

Limit display to
width.

-?, --help

Display usage message and
exit.

NOTES

pcp-numastat
is inspired by the numastat(1) command and produces
exactly the same output.

PCP ENVIRONMENT

Environment
variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On
each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains
the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).

For environment
variables affecting PCP tools, see
pmGetOptions(3).
