PUBLICKEY(5) BSD File Formats Manual PUBLICKEY(5)

NAME

publickey &mdash; public
key database

SYNOPSIS

/etc/publickey

DESCRIPTION

/etc/publickey is the
public key database used for secure RPC (Remote Procedure
Calls). Each entry in the database consists of a network
user name (which may either refer to a user or a hostname),
followed by the user&rsquo;s public key (in hex notation), a
colon, and then the user&rsquo;s secret key encrypted with
its login password (also in hex notation).

This file is
altered either by the user through the chkey(1) command or
by the system administrator through the newkey(8) command.
The file /etc/publickey should only contain data on
the NIS master machine, where it is converted into the NIS
database publickey.byname.
