NAME
       ppmcolors - obsolete

DESCRIPTION
       ppmcolors  is  obsolete.   The  more general program pamseq(1) took its
       place in June 2002.

       ppmcolors remains for backward compatibility, but all it  does  is  run
       pamseq.  It is slower and less flexible than running pamseq directly.
