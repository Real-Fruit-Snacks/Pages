UPGT(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual UPGT(4)

NAME

upgt &mdash;
Conexant/Intersil PrismGT SoftMAC USB IEEE 802.11b/g
wireless network device

SYNOPSIS

To compile this driver into the
kernel, place the following lines in your kernel
configuration file:

device ehci

device uhci 
device ohci 
device usb 
device upgt 
device wlan

Alternatively,
to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following line in loader.conf(5):

if_upgt_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION

The upgt driver supports
the USB 2.0 Conexant/Intersil PrismGT series wireless
adapters based on the GW3887 chipset.

These are the
modes the upgt driver can operate in:

BSS mode

Also known as
infrastructure mode, this is used when associating
with an access point, through which all traffic passes. This
mode is the default.

monitor mode

In this mode
the driver is able to receive packets without associating
with an access point. This disables the internal receive
filter and enables the card to capture packets from networks
which it wouldn&rsquo;t normally have access to, or to scan
for access points.

upgt
supports software WEP. Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) is the
de facto encryption standard for wireless networks. It can
be typically configured in one of three modes: no
encryption; 40-bit encryption; or 104-bit encryption.
Unfortunately, due to serious weaknesses in WEP protocol it
is strongly recommended that it not be used as the sole
mechanism to secure wireless communication. WEP is not
enabled by default.

The upgt
driver can be configured at runtime with ifconfig(8).

FILES

This driver requires the
upgtfw firmware to be installed before it will work.
The firmware files are not publicly available. A package of
the firmware which can be installed via pkg_add(1) is
available:

EXAMPLES

Join an existing BSS network
(i.e., connect to an access point):

ifconfig wlan
create wlandev upgt0 inet 192.168.0.20 \ 
netmask 0xffffff00

Join a specific
BSS network with network name
&rsquo;&rsquo;my_net&rsquo;&rsquo;:

ifconfig wlan
create wlandev upgt0 ssid my_net up

Join a specific
BSS network with 64-bit WEP encryption:

ifconfig wlan
create wlandev upgt0 ssid my_net \ 
wepmode on wepkey 0x1234567890 weptxkey 1 up

HISTORY

The upgt driver first
appeared in OpenBSD 4.3.

AUTHORS

The upgt driver was
written by Marcus Glocker
mglocker [AT] openbsd.org>.

The hardware
specification was reverse engineered by the people at
http://www.prism54.org.

CAVEATS

The upgt driver just
supports the USB 2.0 devices (GW3887 chipset) but not the
USB 1.0 devices containing the NET2280, ISL3880, and ISL3886
chipsets. Some further efforts would be necessary to add USB
1.0 support to the driver.
