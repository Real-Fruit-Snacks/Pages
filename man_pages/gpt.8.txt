GPT(8) BSD System Manager’s Manual GPT(8)

NAME

gpt — GUID
partition table maintenance utility

SYNOPSIS

gpt
[general_options] command
[command_options] device ...

DESCRIPTION

The gpt utility provides
the necessary functionality to manipulate GUID partition
tables (GPTs), but see BUGS below for how and where
functionality is missing. The basic usage model of the
gpt tool follows that of the cvs(1) tool. The general
options are described in the following paragraph. The
remaining paragraphs describe the individual commands with
their options. Here we conclude by mentioning that a
device is either a special file corresponding to a
disk-like device or a regular file. The command is applied
to each device listed on the command line.

General
Options 
The general options allow the user to change default
settings or otherwise change the behaviour that is
applicable to all commands. Not all commands use all default
settings, so some general options may not have an effect on
all commands.

The
−p count option allows the user to
change the number of partitions the GPT can accomodate. This
is used whenever a new GPT is created. By default, the
gpt utility will create space for 128 partitions (or
32 sectors of 512 bytes).

The
−r option causes the gpt utility to open
the device for reading only. Currently this option is
primarily useful for the show command, but the intent
is to use it to implement dry-run behaviour.

The
−v option controls the verbosity level. The
level increases with every occurrence of this option. There
is no formalized definition of the different levels yet.

Commands

gpt add [−b number]
[−i index] [−s
count] [−t type] device
...

The add command allows
the user to add a new partition to an existing table. By
default, it will create a UFS partition covering the first
available block of an unused disk space. The
command-specific options can be used to control this
behaviour.

The
−b number option allows the user to
specify the starting (beginning) sector number of the
partition. The minimum sector number is 1, but has to fall
inside an unused region of disk space that is covered by the
GPT.

The
−i index option allows the user to
specify which (free) entry in the GPT table is to be used
for the new partition. By default the first free entry is
selected.

The
−s count option allows the user to
specify the size of the partition in sectors. The minimum
size is 1.

The
−t type option allows the user to
specify the partition type. The type is given as an UUID,
but gpt accepts efi, swap, ufs,
linux and windows as aliases for the most
commonly used partition types.

gpt create
[−p] device ...

The create command
allows the user to create a new (empty) GPT.

The
−p option tells gpt to create only the
primary table and not the backup table. This option is only
useful for debugging and should not be used otherwise.

gpt destroy
[−r] device ...

The destroy command
allows the user to destroy an existing, possibly not empty
GPT.

The
−r option instructs gpt to destroy the
table in a way that it can be recovered.

gpt migrate
[−k] [−s] device ...

The migrate command
allows the user to migrate an MBR-based disk partitioning
into a GPT-based partitioning.

The
−k option instructs gpt to not destroy
the current MBR. This option is primarily useful for
debugging and should not be used by users.

The
−s option prevents migrating BSD disk labels
into GPT partitions by creating the GPT equivalent of a
slice.

gpt remove
[−b number] [−i
index] [−s count]
[−t type] device ...

The remove command
allows the user to remove any partitions that match the
selection. BEWARE: when no options are given, all GPT
partitions will match and thus will be deleted.

The
−b number option selects the partitions
that starts at the given number.

The
−i index option selects the partition
with the given partition number.

The
−s count option selects all partitions
that have the given size. This can cause multiple partitions
to be removed.

The
−t type option selects all partitions
that have the given type. The type is given as an UUID or by
the aliases that the add command accepts. This can
cause multiple partitions to be removed.

gpt show device
...

The show command
displays the current partitioning on the listed devices and
gives an overall view of the disk contents.

HISTORY

The gpt utility appeared
in FreeBSD 5.0 for ia64.

BUGS

The development of the
gpt utility is still work in progress. Many necessary
features are missing or partially implemented. In practice
this means that the manual page, supposed to describe these
features, is farther removed from being complete or useful.
As such, missing functionality is not even documented as
missing. However, it is believed that the currently present
functionality is reliable and stable enough that this tool
can be used without bullet-proof footware if one thinks one
does not make mistakes.

It is expected
that the basic usage model does not change, but it is
possible that future versions will not be compatible in the
strictest sense of the word. For example, the
−p count option may be changed to a
command option rather than a generic option. There are only
two commands that use it so there is a chance that the
natural tendency for people is to use it as a command
option. Also, options primarily intended for diagnostic or
debug purposes may be removed in future versions.

Another
possibility is that the current usage model is accompanied
by other interfaces to make the tool usable as a back-end.
This all depends on demand and thus feedback.
