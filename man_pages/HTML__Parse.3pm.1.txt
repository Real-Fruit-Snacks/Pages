NAME
       HTML::Parse - Deprecated, a wrapper around HTML::TreeBuilder

VERSION
       This document describes version 5.07 of HTML::Parse, released August
       31, 2017 as part of HTML-Tree.

SYNOPSIS
         See the documentation for HTML::TreeBuilder

DESCRIPTION
       Disclaimer: This module is provided only for backwards compatibility
       with earlier versions of this library.  New code should not use this
       module, and should really use the HTML::Parser and HTML::TreeBuilder
       modules directly, instead.

       The "HTML::Parse" module provides functions to parse HTML documents.
       There are two functions exported by this module:

       parse_html($html) or parse_html($html, $obj)
           This function is really just a synonym for $obj->parse($html) and
           $obj is assumed to be a subclass of "HTML::Parser".  Refer to
           HTML::Parser for more documentation.

           If $obj is not specified, the $obj will default to an internally
           created new "HTML::TreeBuilder" object configured with
           strict_comment() turned on.  That class implements a parser that
           builds (and is) a HTML syntax tree with HTML::Element objects as
           nodes.

           The return value from parse_html() is $obj.

       parse_htmlfile($file, [$obj])
           Same as parse_html(), but pulls the HTML to parse, from the named
           file.

           Returns "undef" if the file could not be opened, or $obj otherwise.

       When a "HTML::TreeBuilder" object is created, the following variables
       control how parsing takes place:

       $HTML::Parse::IMPLICIT_TAGS
           Setting this variable to true will instruct the parser to try to
           deduce implicit elements and implicit end tags.  If this variable
           is false you get a parse tree that just reflects the text as it
           stands.  Might be useful for quick & dirty parsing.  Default is
           true.

           Implicit elements have the implicit() attribute set.

       $HTML::Parse::IGNORE_UNKNOWN
           This variable contols whether unknown tags should be represented as
           elements in the parse tree.  Default is true.

       $HTML::Parse::IGNORE_TEXT
           Do not represent the text content of elements.  This saves space if
           all you want is to examine the structure of the document.  Default
           is false.

       $HTML::Parse::WARN
           Call warn() with an appropriate message for syntax errors.  Default
           is false.

REMEMBER!
       HTML::TreeBuilder objects should be explicitly destroyed when you're
       finished with them.  See HTML::TreeBuilder.
