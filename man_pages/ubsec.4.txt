UBSEC(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual UBSEC(4)

NAME

ubsec â€” Broadcom
and BlueSteel uBsec 5x0x crypto accelerator

SYNOPSIS

To compile this driver into the
kernel, place the following lines in your kernel
configuration file:

device
crypto 
device cryptodev 
device ubsec

Alternatively,
to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following line in loader.conf(5):

ubsec_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION

The ubsec driver supports
cards containing Broadcom and BlueSteel uBsec 5x0x crypto
accelerator chips.

The ubsec
driver registers itself to accelerate DES, Triple-DES,
MD5-HMAC, and SHA1-HMAC operations for ipsec(4) and
crypto(4).

On those models
which contain a public key engine (almost all of the more
recent ones), this feature is registered with the crypto(4)
subsystem.

On all models
except the Bluesteel 5501 and Broadcom 5801, the driver
registers itself to provide random data to the random(4)
subsystem.

HARDWARE

The ubsec driver supports
cards containing any of the following chips:

Bluesteel 5501

The original
chipset, no longer made. This extremely rare unit was not
very fast, lacked an RNG, and had a number of other
bugs.

Bluesteel 5601

A faster and
fixed version of the original, with a random number unit and
large number engine added.

Broadcom BCM5801

A BCM5805
without public key engine or random number generator.

Broadcom BCM5802

A slower
version of the BCM5805.

Broadcom BCM5805

Faster version
of Bluesteel 5601.

Broadcom BCM5820

64 bit version
of the chip, and significantly more advanced.

Broadcom BCM5821

Faster version
of the BCM5820. This is the chip found on the Sun Crypto
Accelerator 1000.

Broadcom BCM5822

Faster version
of the BCM5820.

Broadcom BCM5823

A BCM5822 with
AES capability.

Broadcom BCM5825

Faster version
of the BCM5823.

HISTORY

The ubsec device driver
appeared in OpenBSD 2.8. The ubsec device driver
was imported to FreeBSD 5.0.

BUGS

The BCM5801 and BCM5802 have not
actually been tested. The AES capability of the BCM5823 is
not yet supported; it is awaiting public disclosure of
programming information from Broadcom.
