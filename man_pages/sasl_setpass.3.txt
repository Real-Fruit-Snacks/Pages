DESCRIPTION

sasl_setpass(sasl_conn_t *conn, 
const char *user, 
const char *pass, unsigned passlen, 
const char *oldpass, unsigned oldpasslen, 
unsigned flags)

sasl_setpass will set
passwords in the sasldb, and trigger the setpass callbacks
for all available mechanisms. 
Parameters

•

conn – is the SASL connection context

•

user – is the username to set the password
for 

•

pass – the password to set

•

passlen – length of the password to set
(pass) 

•

oldpass – optional. The old password.

•

oldpasslen – optional. The old password
length. 

•

flags –

are flags
including SASL_SET_CREATE and SASL_SET_DISABLE
(to cause the creating of nonexistent accounts and the
disabling of an account, respectively)

oldpass
and oldpasslen are unused in the Cyrus SASL
implementation, though are passed on to any mechanisms that
may require them.

RETURN VALUE

SASL callback
functions should return SASL return codes. See sasl.h for a
complete list. SASL_OK indicates success.

Other return
codes indicate errors and should be handled.
