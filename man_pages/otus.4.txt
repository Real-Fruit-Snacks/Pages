OTUS(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual OTUS(4)

NAME

otus &mdash; Atheros
AR9170 USB IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n wireless network device

SYNOPSIS

To compile this driver into the
kernel, place the following lines in your kernel
configuration file:

device ehci

device uhci 
device ohci 
device usb 
device otus 
device wlan

Alternatively,
to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following line in loader.conf(5):

if_otus_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION

The otus driver supports
USB 2.0 wireless network devices based on the Atheros AR9170
chipset.

The Atheros
AR9170 is a draft-802.11n adapter that uses an external
radio to operate in either 2.4GHz only or 2.4GHz and
5GHz.

The AR9101 radio
supports 1T1R operation in 2GHz only.

The AR9102 radio
supports 2T2R operation in 2GHz only.

The AR9104 radio
supports 2T2R operation both 2GHz and 5GHz.

These are the
modes the otus driver can operate in:

BSS mode

Also known as
infrastructure mode, this is used when associating
with an access point, through which all traffic passes. This
mode is the default.

The otus
driver can be configured to use Wired Equivalent Privacy
(WEP) or Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA-PSK and WPA2-PSK). WPA
is the de facto encryption standard for wireless networks.
It is strongly recommended that WEP not be used as the sole
mechanism to secure wireless communication, due to serious
weaknesses in it.

The otus
driver can be configured at runtime with ifconfig(8).

FILES

The driver needs at least
version 1.0 of the following firmware files, which is loaded
when an interface is attached:

/boot/kernel/otusfw-init.ko 
/boot/kernel/otusfw-main.ko

HARDWARE

The otus driver provices

EXAMPLES

Join an existing BSS network
(i.e., connect to an access point):

ifconfig wlan
create wlandev otus0 inet 192.168.0.20 \ 
netmask 0xffffff00

Join a specific
BSS network with network name
&rsquo;&rsquo;my_net&rsquo;&rsquo;:

ifconfig wlan
create wlandev otus0 ssid my_net up

Join a specific
BSS network with 64-bit WEP encryption:

ifconfig wlan
create wlandev otus0 ssid my_net \ 
wepmode on wepkey 0x1234567890 weptxkey 1 up

DIAGNOSTICS

%s: failed load firmware of
file otusfw-main  For some reason, the driver was
unable to read the microcode file from the filesystem. The
file might be missing or corrupted.

CAVEATS

The otus driver only
supports 802.11a/b/g operations. 802.11 operation is not
supported at this time.
