DESCRIPTION

When
folder is given the -print switch (the
default), it lists: the current folder, the number of
messages in it and their range (low-high), the
folder&rsquo;s current message, and an indication of extra
files, if any. For example:

inbox+

has 16 messages

( 3- 22);

cur= 5.

If a
+folder and/or msg are specified, they will
become the current folder and/or message. (When a
+folder argument is given, this corresponds to a
&ldquo;cd&rdquo; operation in the shell; when no
+folder argument is given, this corresponds roughly
to a &ldquo;pwd&rdquo; operation in the shell.) If
-noprint is specified, a +folder and/or
msg may still be specified to set the current folder
and/or message, but the folder summary will not be
printed.

If the
specified (or default) folder doesn&rsquo;t exist,
folder will ask the user if the folder should be
created; when standard input is not a tty, the answer is
assumed to be &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. The -create switch
tells folder to create new folders without query.
(This is an easy way to create an empty folder for later
use.) Specifying -nocreate will cause folder
to print an error message and exit without creating a
folder.

Multiple
Folders 
Specifying -all will produce a summary line for each
top-level folder in the user&rsquo;s nmh directory,
sorted alphabetically. (If folder is invoked by a
name ending with &ldquo;s&rdquo; (e.g. folders),
-all is assumed.) Specifying -recurse with
-all will include a line for all sub-folders. These
folders are all preceded by any read-only folders, which
occur as &ldquo;atr-cur-&rdquo; entries in the
user&rsquo;s nmh context. For example:

FOLDER

# MESSAGES

RANGE

CUR (OTHERS)

/var/work/folder

has 35 messages

( 1- 35);

cur=23.

/usr/bugs/Mail

has 82 messages

( 1-108);

cur=82.

ff

has no messages.

inbox+

has 16 messages

( 3- 22);

cur= 5.

mh

has 76 messages

(15- 76);

cur=70.

notes

has 2 messages

( 1- 2);

cur= 1.

ucom

has 124 messages

( 1-124);

cur= 6; (others).

TOTAL = 339 messages in 7
folders

The
&ldquo;+&rdquo; after inbox indicates that it is the
current folder. The &ldquo;(others)&rdquo; indicates that
the folder ucom contains files which aren&rsquo;t
messages; these may either be sub-folders, or files that
don&rsquo;t belong under the nmh file naming
scheme.

The header is
output if either the -all or -header switches
are specified. It is suppressed by -noheader.

The folder and
message totals are output if either the -all or
-total switches are specified. They are suppressed by
-nototal.

If -fast
is given, only the folder name (or names, in the case of
-all) will be listed. (This is faster because the
folders need not be read.)

If a
+folder is given with the -all switch,
folder will, in addition to setting the current
folder, list the top-level sub-folders for the current
folder (with -norecurse) or list all sub-folders
under the current folder recursively (with
-recurse).

If msg
is supplied, together with +folder or without
-all, it will become the current message of
+folder (if it had been supplied) or the current
folder.

The
-recurse switch lists each folder recursively, so its
use effectively defeats the speed enhancement of
-fast, since each folder must be searched for
sub-folders. Nevertheless, the combination of these options
is useful.

Compacting a
Folder 
The -pack switch will compress the message names in
the designated folders, removing holes in message numbering.
The -verbose switch directs folder to tell the
user the general actions it is taking to compress the
folder.

The Folder
Stack 
The -push switch directs folder to push the
current folder onto the folder-stack, and make the
+folder argument the current folder. If
+folder is not given, the current folder and the top
of the folder-stack are exchanged. This corresponds
to the &ldquo;pushd&rdquo; operation in the shell.

The -pop
switch directs folder to discard the top of the
folder-stack, after setting the current folder to
that value. No +folder argument is allowed. This
corresponds to the &ldquo;popd&rdquo; operation in the
shell. The -push and -pop switches are
mutually exclusive: the last occurrence of either one
overrides any previous occurrence of the other. The use of
either of these switches also sets -list, by
default.

The
-list switch directs folder to list the
folder-stack. No +folder argument is allowed.
After a successful -push or -pop, the
-list action is taken, unless a -nolist switch
follows them on the command line. This corresponds to the
&ldquo;dirs&rdquo; operation in the shell. The -push,
-pop, and -list switches disable the default
-print behavior.

DEFAULTS

+folder

The current folder.

msg

&ldquo;none&rdquo;

-nofast

-noheader

-nototal

-nopack

-norecurse

-noverbose

-print

is the default if none of -list, -push, or
-pop are specified.

-list

is the default if -push, or -pop is
specified. 

CONTEXT

If
+folder and/or msg are given, they will become
the current folder and/or message.

BUGS

There is no way
to restore the default behavior (to ask the user whether to
create a non-existent folder) after -create or
-nocreate is given.
