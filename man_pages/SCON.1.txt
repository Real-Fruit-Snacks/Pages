DESCRIPTION

The scon utility controls
several aspects of the runtime behaviour of the pcvt vt220
driver.

The options are
as follows:

&minus;a

Returns a
string describing the video adaptor found by pcvt, the
string returned could be MDA, HGC, CGA, EGA, VGA or
UNKNOWN.

&minus;c

Specify the
screen number the current (displayed) screen should be
switched to.

&minus;d

Specify the
device filename (i.e., /dev/ttyv2) further operations
specified on the command line should be applied to.

&minus;f

Some programs
which silently assume 24 lines when they run on a VT220 show
incorrect behaviour when the terminal has really 25 lines.
To support full VT220 behaviour, it is possible to force
pcvt to select only 24 lines when it is running in 25-lines
pure VT mode and/or in 28-lines HP-mode. The &minus;f
option requires one additional parameter, the string
&rsquo;on&rsquo; or &rsquo;off&rsquo; to switch this mode
for a virtual screen on or off respectively. This mode has
no effect if any other vertical resolutions are selected
than the two above mentioned.

&minus;h

Prints a
usage/help text.

&minus;l

Lists the
current configuration of runtime changeable options and
fixed parameters (such as the type of the adaptor, and in
case of a VGA adaptor, the Manufacturer, Chipset and 132
column support) of the output portion of the pcvt
driver.

&minus;m

Returns a
string describing the connected display monitor type found
by pcvt, the string returned can be MONO, COLOR or
UNKNOWN.

&minus;v

Specify verbose
operation of the program.

&minus;V

Switch the
specified/current screen into a pure VT220 mode without
recognizing any HP escape sequences and without displaying
function key labels.

&minus;H

Switch the
specified/current screen into a mixed HP/VT220 mode. That
is, that in addition to the full VT220 emulation, the HP
function key labels and the escape sequences for handling
the labels are available to the user.

&minus;s

Specify the
number of character lines on the screen. Possible parameters
are 25, 28, 35, 40, 43 or 50. To use all this screen sizes,
the fonts required for proper operation of a desired size
have to be downloaded to the EGA/VGA font ram. This option
is available only for EGA and VGA boards.

&minus;p

Modify VGA
palette (DAC). The &minus;p is mutually exclusive
with &minus;s, &minus;H, and &minus;V.
Naturally, option &minus;p is available only for VGA
boards. Three flavors are available.

If used with
argument &rsquo;&rsquo;default&rsquo;&rsquo;, this
flag will restore the default palette (as installed by VGA
ROM BIOS after hardware reset).

If used with
argument &rsquo;&rsquo;list&rsquo;&rsquo;, the
current VGA DAC palette entries are listed. Each entry
contains the table index, values for red, green, and blue,
and if there&rsquo;s a known name for this entry, the color
name. Trailing empty table slots (RGB values all zero) are
omitted.

Otherwise, four
comma-separated arguments are expected. The first denotes
the number of palette entry to be modified. This may be
either a number between 0 and 255, or the usual name of an
associated color (case-insensitive). The following values
for red, green and blue are restricted to 0 through 63 due
to VGA DAC conventions. Note that the first delimiter within
such an argument may be a colon
&rsquo;&rsquo;:&rsquo;&rsquo; instead of a comma
&rsquo;&rsquo;,&rsquo;&rsquo; for better readability, but
this violates common command argument conventions. Multiple
&minus;p options may be specified if unambiguous.

&minus;t

Specifying
&minus;t will activate the screen saver. The
behaviour depends on timeout: if timeout is
given as 0, the screen saver is turned off. Otherwise,
timeout is taken as a number of seconds to wait until
activating the screen saver. NOTE: the &minus;t
option is only available if screen saver support has been
compiled into the driver!

&minus;1

Sets 132
columns mode (only available on VGA adaptors).

&minus;8

Sets 80 columns
mode.

When switching
between HP and VT mode, when switching the force 24 lines
mode on and off, or when switching between 80 and 132
columns operation, the screen is cleared, the scrolling
region is reset and the cursor is placed in the home
position.

EXAMPLES

The command &rsquo;&rsquo;scon
&minus;H &minus;s 28&rsquo;&rsquo; places the
current screen into HP mode and sets the screen size to
28x80.

Invoking
&rsquo;&rsquo;

scon &minus;p lightgray,0,15,0
&minus;p 0:45,45,45 &rsquo;&rsquo; will result
in green on gray output for normal text. Note that normal
text color is light gray, and not white as one might
expect.

BUGS

the &minus;c and
&minus;d options collide somehow, this will change in
a future release.
