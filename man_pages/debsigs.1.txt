NAME

debsigs -
process signatures in .deb packages

SYNOPSIS

debsigs
--list|-l [-v] file [file...]

debsigs
--sign=type [--default-key=keyID] [-v]
file [file...]

debsigs
--verify|--check|-c file [file...]

debsigs
--delete=type file [file...]

DESCRIPTION

debsigs
is used to manipulate the cryptographic signatures stored
inside a .deb file. It is not used to verify those
signatures; for that purpose, see
debsig-verify(1).

OPTIONS

--list
or -l or -t

Lists the signatures found in
the specified file.

--sign=type

Creates a new signature of the
type specified in the given file. The signature will be
created using the default key for your GPG
keyring. See " SIGNATURE TYPES"
below for possible values of the "type"
field.

--default-key=keyID

Uses a key other than the
default for signing the package.

--secret-keyring=file or
-K file

Uses a keyring other than the
default for signing the package. This option is passed along
to GPG verbatim; see the discussion in the
gpg(1) manpage for information on how to specify the
keyring file.

-v

Displays verbose output.

--verify or
--check or -c

Invokes debsig-verify to check
the validity of the signature on this package.

--delete=type

Deletes the signature of the
specified type from the package.

SIGNATURE TYPES

A Debian
package may carry different types of signatures. The most
commonly-used ones are:

•

"origin"

The official
signature of the organization which distributes the package,
usually the Debian Project or a GNU/Linux distribution
derived from it. This signature may be added
automatically.

•

"maint"

The signature
of the maintainer of the Debian package. This signature
should be added by the maintainer before uploading the
package.

•

"archive" 

An
automatically-added signature renewed periodically to ensure
that a package downloaded from an online archive is indeed
the latest version distributed by the organization.

See the
/usr/share/doc/debsigs/signing-policy.txt file for
more information and rationale for the different signature
types.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS

It would be
nice to have a command-line option to change the command
used for signing, instead of hard-coding
"gpg".
