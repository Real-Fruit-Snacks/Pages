NAME
       lmhosts - The Samba NetBIOS hosts file

SYNOPSIS
       lmhosts is the samba(7) NetBIOS name to IP address mapping file.

DESCRIPTION
       This file is part of the samba(7) suite.

       lmhosts is the Samba NetBIOS name to IP address mapping file. It is
       very similar to the /etc/hosts file format, except that the hostname
       component must correspond to the NetBIOS naming format.

FILE FORMAT
       It is an ASCII file containing one line for NetBIOS name. The two
       fields on each line are separated from each other by white space. Any
       entry beginning with '#' is ignored. Each line in the lmhosts file
       contains the following information:

              •   IP Address - in dotted decimal format.

              •   NetBIOS Name - This name format is a maximum fifteen
                  character host name, with an optional trailing '#' character
                  followed by the NetBIOS name type as two hexadecimal digits.

                  If the trailing '#' is omitted then the given IP address
                  will be returned for all names that match the given name,
                  whatever the NetBIOS name type in the lookup.

       An example follows:

           #
           # Sample Samba lmhosts file.
           #
           192.9.200.1    TESTPC
           192.9.200.20   NTSERVER#20
           192.9.200.21   SAMBASERVER

       Contains three IP to NetBIOS name mappings. The first and third will be
       returned for any queries for the names "TESTPC" and "SAMBASERVER"
       respectively, whatever the type component of the NetBIOS name
       requested.

       The second mapping will be returned only when the "0x20" name type for
       a name "NTSERVER" is queried. Any other name type will not be resolved.

       The default location of the lmhosts file is in the same directory as
       the smb.conf(5) file.

FILES
       lmhosts is loaded from the configuration directory. This is usually
       /etc/samba or /usr/local/samba/lib.
