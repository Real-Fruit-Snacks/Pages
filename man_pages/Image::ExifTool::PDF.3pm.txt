DESCRIPTION
       This code reads meta information from PDF (Adobe Portable Document
       Format) files.  It supports object streams introduced in PDF-1.5 but
       only with a limited set of Filter and Predictor algorithms, however all
       standard encryption methods through PDF-1.7 extension level 3 are
       supported, including AESV2 (AES-128) and AESV3 (AES-256).
