NAME
       ppmtoeyuv - convert a PPM image into a Berkeley YUV file

SYNOPSIS
       ppmtoeyuv

       [ppmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       ppmtoeyuv  reads  a  PPM image as input and produces a Berkeley Encoder
       YUV (not the same as Abekas YUV) file on the Standard Output file.

       With no argument, ppmtoeyuvtakes input from Standard Input.  Otherwise,
       ppmfile is the file specification of the input file.

       ppmtoeyuv handles multi-image PPM input streams, outputting consecutive
       eyuv images.  There must be at least one image, though.

OPTIONS
       There are no command line options defined specifically  for  ppmtoeyuv,
       but it recognizes the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm
       (See
        Common Options ⟨index.html#commonoptions⟩ .)
