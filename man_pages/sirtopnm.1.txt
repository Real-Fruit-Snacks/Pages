NAME
       sirtopnm - convert a Solitaire file to PNM

SYNOPSIS
       sirtopnm

       [sirfile]

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       sirtopnm  reads a Solitaire Image Recorder file as input and produces a
       PNM image as output.  The type of the output file depends on the  input
       file  - if it's an MGI TYPE 17 file, sirtopnm generates a PGM file.  If
       it's an MGI TYPE 11 file, sirtopnm generates PPM.   The  program  tells
       you which type it is writing.

OPTIONS
       There  are  no  command line options defined specifically for sirtopnm,
       but it recognizes the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm
       (See
        Common Options ⟨index.html#commonoptions⟩ .)
