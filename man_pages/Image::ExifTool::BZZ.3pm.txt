NAME
       Image::ExifTool::BZZ - Utility to decode BZZ compressed data

SYNOPSIS
       This module is used by Image::ExifTool

DESCRIPTION
       This module contains definitions required by Image::ExifTool to decode
       BZZ compressed data in DjVu images.

NOTES
       This code is based on ZPCodec and BSByteStream of DjVuLibre 3.5.21 (see
       additional copyrights and the first reference below), which are covered
       under the GNU GPL license.

       This is implemented as Image::ExifTool::BZZ instead of Compress::BZZ
       because I am hoping that someone else will write a proper Compress::BZZ
       module (with compression ability).
