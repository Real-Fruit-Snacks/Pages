EXINEXT(8)                  System Manager's Manual                 EXINEXT(8)

NAME
       exinext - Finding individual retry times

SYNOPSIS
       exinext address|message-id

DESCRIPTION
       A utility called exinext (mostly a Perl script) provides the ability to
       fish specific information out of the retry database.  Given a mail  do‐
       main  (or  a  complete address), it looks up the hosts for that domain,
       and outputs any retry information for the hosts or for the domain.   At
       present,  the retry information is obtained by running exim_dumpdb (see
       below) and processing the output.  For example:

         exinext piglet@milne.fict.example
         kanga.milne.fict.example:192.168.8.1 error 146: Connection refused
           first failed: 21-Feb-1996 14:57:34
           last tried:   21-Feb-1996 14:57:34
           next try at:  21-Feb-1996 15:02:34
         roo.milne.fict.example:192.168.8.3 error 146: Connection refused
           first failed: 20-Jan-1996 13:12:08
           last tried:   21-Feb-1996 11:42:03
           next try at:  21-Feb-1996 19:42:03
           past final cutoff time

       You can also give exinext a local part, without a domain, and  it  will
       give  any retry information for that local part in your default domain.
       A message id can be used to obtain retry information  pertaining  to  a
       specific  message.   This exists only when an attempt to deliver a mes‐
       sage to a remote host suffers a  message-specific  error  (see  section
       42.2).   exinext  is  not particularly efficient, but then it isn't ex‐
       pected to be run very often.

BUGS
       This manual page needs a major re-work. If somebody knows better  groff
       than  us  and  has more experience in writing manual pages, any patches
       would be greatly appreciated.
