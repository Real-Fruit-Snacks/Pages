NAME

mhparam - print
nmh profile and context components

SYNOPSIS

mhparam

[-help] [-version]
[components] [-all] [-component |

-nocomponent]
[-debug]

DESCRIPTION

mhparam
writes the value of the specified profile component to the
standard output, separated by newlines. Component name
matching is case-insensitive. If the profile component is
not present, the default value (or nothing, if there is no
default) is printed.

If the switch
-component is given, then the component name is
displayed along with the profile components value. This can
be disabled with the switch -nocomponent.

If more than
one component is specified in the components list,
then the switch -component is on by default. If only
one component is specified, then the switch
-nocomponent is on by default.

If -all
is specified, then all components in the nmh profile are
displayed and other arguments are ignored.

mhparam
can provide other information, such as the nmh
version identifier, the locations of the nmh bindir,
libexecdir, etcdir, and docdir install
directories, all proc settings, and the
datalocking method described in mh-profile(5).
Information about the configuration of the nmh
installation is also available, including the default mail
spool locking method. To test whether the configuration
includes support for SASL, TLS, iconv(3), and oauth,
the following commands, respectively, will output a non-null
string to indicate support:

mhparam sasl

mhparam tls 
mhparam iconv 
mhparam oauth

Conversely, no
output means that the specified support is not included. The
-debug switch displays all such other information
available from mhparam.

Examples:

$ mhparam path

/usr/lib/mh/mhl
