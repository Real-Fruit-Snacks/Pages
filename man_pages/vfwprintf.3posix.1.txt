VFWPRINTF(3POSIX)          POSIX Programmer's Manual         VFWPRINTF(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       vfwprintf, vswprintf, vwprintf — wide-character formatted output  of  a
       stdarg argument list

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdarg.h>
       #include <stdio.h>
       #include <wchar.h>

       int vfwprintf(FILE *restrict stream, const wchar_t *restrict format,
           va_list arg);
       int vswprintf(wchar_t *restrict ws, size_t n,
           const wchar_t *restrict format, va_list arg);
       int vwprintf(const wchar_t *restrict format, va_list arg);

DESCRIPTION
       The  functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
       ISO C standard. Any conflict between the  requirements  described  here
       and  the  ISO C  standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1‐2017
       defers to the ISO C standard.

       The vfwprintf(), vswprintf(), and vwprintf() functions shall be equiva‐
       lent to fwprintf(), swprintf(), and wprintf() respectively, except that
       instead of being called with a variable number of arguments,  they  are
       called with an argument list as defined by <stdarg.h>.

       These  functions  shall  not invoke the va_end macro. However, as these
       functions do invoke the va_arg macro, the value of ap after the  return
       is unspecified.

RETURN VALUE
       Refer to fwprintf().

ERRORS
       Refer to fwprintf().

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       Applications using these functions should call va_end(ap) afterwards to
       clean up.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
