NAME

libguestfs-tools.conf
- configuration file for guestfish, guestmount,
virt-rescue

SYNOPSIS

/etc/libguestfs-tools.conf

$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/libguestfs/libguestfs-tools.conf 
$HOME/.libguestfs-tools.rc 
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/libguestfs/libguestfs-tools.conf

DESCRIPTION

libguestfs-tools.conf
(or $HOME/.libguestfs-tools.rc) changes the defaults
for the following programs only:

•

guestfish(1)

•

guestmount(1)

•

virt-rescue(1)

There is
currently only one setting which is controlled by this file.
Adding (or uncommenting):

read_only =
true;

changes these
programs so they act as if the --ro flag was given on
the command line. You can use this to make the programs safe
against accidental modification of a live guest (users would
have to explicitly add the --rw flag to modify
guests). This is not the default because it is not backwards
compatible. See also "OPENING DISKS FOR READ AND
WRITE" in guestfish(1).

Note that
the semicolon is required.

This file is
parsed by the libconfig library. For more information about
the format, see:
http://www.hyperrealm.com/libconfig/libconfig_manual.html

FILE LOCATION

The order of
the configuration files being read is, by importance:

•

$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/libguestfs/libguestfs-tools.conf
($XDG_CONFIG_HOME is $HOME/.config if not set).

•

$HOME/.libguestfs-tools.rc

•

$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/libguestfs/libguestfs-tools.conf (where
$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS means any of the directories in that
environment variable, or just /etc/xdg if not
set) 

•

/etc/libguestfs-tools.conf

This means
local users can override the system configuration by copying
the configuration file (or creating it anew) into
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/libguestfs/libguestfs-tools.conf.

/etc/libguestfs-tools.conf
and $HOME/.libguestfs-tools.rc are the old non-XDG
paths which are read for compatibility.
