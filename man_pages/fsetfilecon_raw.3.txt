setfilecon(3)              SELinux API documentation             setfilecon(3)

NAME
       setfilecon,  fsetfilecon, lsetfilecon - set SELinux security context of
       a file

SYNOPSIS
       #include <selinux/selinux.h>

       int setfilecon(const char *path, const char *con);

       int setfilecon_raw(const char *path, const char *con);

       int lsetfilecon(const char *path, const char *con);

       int lsetfilecon_raw(const char *path, const char *con);

       int fsetfilecon(int fd, const char *con);

       int fsetfilecon_raw(int fd, const char *con);

DESCRIPTION
       setfilecon() sets the security context of the file system object.

       lsetfilecon() is identical to setfilecon, except in the case of a  sym‐
       bolic  link,  where  the link itself has it's context set, not the file
       that it refers to.

       fsetfilecon() is identical to setfilecon, only the open file pointed to
       by  filedes  (as  returned by open(2)) has it's context set in place of
       path.  Since libselinux 3.4 a file opened via O_PATH is supported.

       setfilecon_raw(), lsetfilecon_raw(), and fsetfilecon_raw() behave iden‐
       tically to their non-raw counterparts but do not perform context trans‐
       lation.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, zero is returned. On failure, -1 is returned and  errno  is
       set appropriately.

ERRORS
       If  there  is insufficient space remaining to store the extended attri‐
       bute, errno is set to either ENOSPC, or EDQUOT if quota enforcement was
       the cause.

       If extended attributes are not supported by the filesystem, or are dis‐
       abled, errno is set to ENOTSUP.

       The errors documented for the stat(2) system call are  also  applicable
       here.
