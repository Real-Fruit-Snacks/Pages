NAME

sane-kodak -
SANE backend for big Kodak flatbed and ADF scanners

DESCRIPTION

The
sane-kodak library implements a SANE (Scanner Access
Now Easy) backend which provides access to large Kodak
flatbed and ADF scanners.

This document
describes backend version 7, which shipped with SANE
1.0.21.

SUPPORTED HARDWARE

This version
should support models which speak the Kodak SCSI and
Firewire protocols. The i1860 was used to develop the
backend, but other models may work with only minimal
modifications. Please see the list at
http://www.sane-project.org/sane-supported-devices.html for
an updated list.

If you have a
machine not on that list, or reported as
’untested’: the best way to determine level of
support is to test the scanner directly, or to collect a
trace of the windows driver in action. Please contact the
author for help or with test results.

UNSUPPORTED HARDWARE

Most of the
recent Kodak consumer or workgroup level machines are based
on other chipsets and are not supported by this backend.
Some of these scanners may be supported by another
backend.

OPTIONS

Effort has been
made to expose the basic hardware options, including:

source s

Selects the source for the
scan. Options may include "Flatbed", "ADF
Front", "ADF Back", "ADF
Duplex".

mode m

Selects the mode for the scan.
Options may include "Lineart",
"Halftone", "Gray", and
"Color".

resolution

Controls scan resolution.
Available choices may be limited by mode.

tl-x, tl-y,
br-x, br-y

Sets scan area upper left and
lower right coordinates. These are renamed t, l, x, y by
some frontends.

page-width,
page-height

Sets paper size. Used by
scanner to determine centering of scan coordinates when
using ADF and to detect double feed errors.

Other options
will be available based on the capabilities of the scanner.
Use ’scanimage --help’ to get a list, but be
aware that some options may be settable only when another
option has been set, and that advanced options may be hidden
by some frontend programs.

CONFIGURATION FILE

The
configuration file "kodak.conf" is used to tell
the backend how to look for scanners, and provide options
controlling the operation of the backend. This file is read
each time the frontend asks the backend for a list of
scanners, generally only when the frontend starts. If the
configuration file is missing, the backend will use a set of
compiled defaults, which are identical to the default
configuration file shipped with SANE.

Scanners can be
specified in the configuration file in 2 ways:

"scsi
KODAK"

Requests backend to search all
scsi busses in the system for a device which reports itself
to be a scanner made by ’KODAK’.

"scsi
/dev/sg0" (or other scsi device file)

Requests backend to open the
named scsi device. Only useful if you have multiple
compatible scanners connected to your system, and need to
specify one. Probably should not be used with the other
"scsi" line above.

The only
configuration option supported is
"buffer-size=xxx", allowing you to set the number
of bytes in the data buffer to something other than the
compiled-in default, 32768 (32K). Some users report that
their scanner will "hang" mid-page, or fail to
transmit the image if the buffer is not large enough.

Note: This
option may appear multiple times in the configuration file.
It only applies to scanners discovered by
’scsi/usb’ lines that follow this option.

Note: The
backend does not place an upper bound on this value, as some
users required it to be quite large. Values above the
default are not recommended, and may crash your OS or lockup
your scsi card driver. You have been warned.

ENVIRONMENT

The backend
uses a single environment variable, SANE_DEBUG_KODAK, which
enables debugging output to stderr. Valid values are:

5 Errors 
10 Function trace 
15 Function detail 
20 Option commands 
25 SCSI trace 
30 SCSI detail 
35 Useless noise

KNOWN ISSUES

Most hardware
options are either not supported or not exposed for control
by the user, including: multifeed detection, image
compression, autocropping, endorser, iThresholding,
multi-stream, etc.

CREDITS

The various
authors of the sane-fujitsu backend provided useful code.

Kodak provided access to hardware, documentation and
personnel.
