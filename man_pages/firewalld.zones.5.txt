firewalld.zones
- firewalld zones

DESCRIPTION

What is a
zone? 
A network zone defines the level of trust for network
connections. This is a one to many relation, which means
that a connection can only be part of one zone, but a zone
can be used for many network connections.

The zone
defines the firewall features that are enabled in this
zone:

Predefined
services

A service is a combination of
port and/or protocol entries. Optionally netfilter helper
modules can be added and also a IPv4 and IPv6 destination
address.

Ports
and protocols

Definition of tcp or
udp ports, where ports can be a single port or a port
range.

ICMP
blocks

Blocks selected Internet
Control Message Protocol (ICMP) messages. These messages are
either information requests or created as a reply to
information requests or in error conditions.

Masquerading

The addresses of a private
network are mapped to and hidden behind a public IP address.
This is a form of address translation.

Forward
ports

A forward port is either mapped
to the same port on another host or to another port on the
same host or to another port on another host.

Rich
language rules

The rich language extends the
elements (service, port, icmp-block, masquerade,
forward-port and source-port) with additional source and
destination addresses, logging, actions and limits for logs
and actions. It can also be used for host or network white
and black listing (for more information, please have a look
at firewalld.richlanguage(5)).

For more
information on the zone file format, please have a look at
firewalld.zone(5).

Which zones
are available? 
Here are the zones provided by firewalld sorted according to
the default trust level of the zones from untrusted to
trusted:

drop

Any incoming network packets
are dropped, there is no reply. Only outgoing network
connections are possible.

block

Any incoming network
connections are rejected with an icmp-host-prohibited
message for IPv4 and icmp6-adm-prohibited for IPv6.
Only network connections initiated within this system are
possible.

public

For use in public areas. You do
not trust the other computers on networks to not harm your
computer. Only selected incoming connections are
accepted.

external

For use on external networks
with masquerading enabled especially for routers. You do not
trust the other computers on networks to not harm your
computer. Only selected incoming connections are
accepted.

dmz

For computers in your
demilitarized zone that are publicly-accessible with limited
access to your internal network. Only selected incoming
connections are accepted.

work

For use in work areas. You
mostly trust the other computers on networks to not harm
your computer. Only selected incoming connections are
accepted.

home

For use in home areas. You
mostly trust the other computers on networks to not harm
your computer. Only selected incoming connections are
accepted.

internal

For use on internal networks.
You mostly trust the other computers on the networks to not
harm your computer. Only selected incoming connections are
accepted.

trusted

All network connections are
accepted.

Which zone
should be used? 
A public WIFI network connection for example should be
mainly untrusted, a wired home network connection should be
fairly trusted. Select the zone that best matches the
network you are using.

How to
configure or add zones? 
To configure or add zones you can either use one of the
firewalld interfaces to handle and change the configuration:
These are the graphical configuration tool firewall-config,
the command line tool firewall-cmd or the D-Bus
interface. Or you can create or copy a zone file in one of
the configuration directories.
/usr/lib/firewalld/zones is used for default and
fallback configurations and /etc/firewalld/zones is
used for user created and customized configuration
files.

How to set
or change a zone for a connection? 
The zone is stored into the ifcfg of the connection with
ZONE= option. If the option is missing or empty, the
default zone set in firewalld is used.

If the
connection is controlled by NetworkManager, you can also use
nm-connection-editor to change the zone.

For the addion
or change of interfaces that are not under control of
NetworkManager: firewalld tries to change the ZONE setting
in the ifcfg file, if an ifcfg file exists that is using the
interface.

Only for the
removal of interfaces that are not under control of
NetworkManager: firewalld is not trying to change the ZONE
setting in the ifcfg file. This is needed to make sure that
an ifdown of the interface will not result in a reset of the
zone setting to the default zone. Only the zone binding is
then removed in firewalld then.
