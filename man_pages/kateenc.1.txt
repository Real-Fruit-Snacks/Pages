[−K threshold] −t
filetype [ infile ]

DESCRIPTION

kateenc
creates Kate streams from input files (SubRip SRT subtitles,
LRC lyrics, and libkate’s custom description
language). When saved to an Ogg stream (the default
behavior), a Kate stream may then be merged with other Ogg
streams (eg, a Theora video) using the oggz tools.

OPTIONS

−h

Show command line help.

−V

Show version information.

−M

Allow simple HTML-like markup in SRT files. If this
parameter is used, strings such as ""
will be interpreted to mean italics, rather than appear as
such. Note that various players interpret a slightly
different set of HTML tags, and some do not.

−o outfile

Write the output Kate stream to
the given file name (writes to stdout if not specified).

−l language

Sets the language for the
stream (default is the language specified in the input, or
none).

−c category

Sets the category for the
stream (default is the category specified in the input, or
none).

−s serial

Sets the serial number for the
output Kate stream (does not apply to raw streams).

−C tag=value

Adds a comment to encode into
the output Kate stream. The comment must be of the form
tag=value, and comply with the Vorbis comment rules (eg, tag
is composed of a particular subset of ASCII characters, and
value is valid UTF-8). Note that you might have to escape or
quote the comment for it to be seen as a single command line
parameter.

−t filetype

Specifies the type of the input
(srt, lrc, kate)

−R threshold

Use repeat packets, with the
given threshold (in seconds). Data packets will be repeated
at intervals of roughly threshold seconds, while active.

−K threshold

Use keepalive packets, with the
given threshold (in seconds). Keepalive packets will be
emitted when no other packet has been emitted for roughly
threshold seconds.

EXAMPLES

Create a Kate
stream for Welsh subtitles from a SubRip file:

kateenc
−t srt −l cy −c SUB −o output.ogg
input.srt
