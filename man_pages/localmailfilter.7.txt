DESCRIPTION

The
maildrop mail filter can be used by the Courier mail
server as a mail filtering engine, rejecting unwanted mail
on a per-recipient basis.

The actual
filtering interface used by the Courier mail server does not
really require that maildrop must be used as a mail
filtering engine, it just so happens that maildrop
has a compatible interface that can be used right out of the
box. The following brief information can be used to craft a
homebrewed mail filter to take maildrop's place.

The local mail
filter only works for addresses that correspond to local
accounts. This filtering is not used if the recipient is a
remote address on another mail server. The local mail filter
is disabled by default. To enable local mail filtering you
will need to initialize the /etc/courier/maildropfilter
configuration file to contain the pathname to your local
mail filter.

Local mail
filtering is performed in two distinct phases:

Recipient
filters

When the Courier mail server
receives an address naming a local mail recipient, the local
mail recipient's mail filter is executed before the Courier
mail server acknowledges the address. The local mail filter
tells the Courier mail server whether to: A) accept message
unconditionally - the message is whitelisted; B) reject the
message unconditionally - the Courier mail server tells the
other mail server that the recipient address is invalid; or
C) accept this recipient, but run the content mail filter,
once the message's contents are available.

Content
filters

After receiving the contents of
the message, the mail filter is executed again for any
recipients whose recipient filters used the third option.
The content filter can now examine the contents of the
message, and indicate whether the message should be accepted
or rejected. Content filtering is not available for alias
addresses.

It should be
noted that mail filtering is executed as an integral part of
receiving a message from a remote mail server. If the
message is rejected, the Courier mail server refuses to
accept the message for delivery.

The local mail
filter will be invoked as follows:

HOME=$HOME
FILTER -D uid/gid -M filter

The local mail
filter will NOT be invoked as root, so if it needs to access
files in the recipient's account, it must be installed
setuid to root (as maildrop is installed by
default).

"uid/gid"
is the recipient account's system userid and group id,
respectively. The recipient account's home directory is
placed in the HOME environment variable, prior to
running FILTER, and "filter" is set
as follows:

rcptfilter

The mail filter is invoked
initially when the remote mail server specifies this address
as a recipient. FILTER should terminate with one of
the following exit codes: 0 - this sender is acceptable; 99
- this sender is acceptable, but I want to run the content
filter for this the message; any other non-zero exit code -
the sender is not acceptable, reject the message.

smtpfilter

If FILTER terminates
with exit code 99, FILTER runs again with this
parameter set to the word smtpfilter. FILTER will be invoked
once the message has been received from the remote mail
server, but not yet acknowledged. If FILTER
terminates with a non-zero exit code, the message is
rejected. If FILTER terminated with the exit code of
zero, the message is accepted.

rcptfilter-ext,
smtpfilter-ext

If the recipient created
sub-addresses - see
dot-courier(5)
[1]
- a dash followed by the subaddress
"ext" is appended to the name of the
filter.

rcptfilter-alias-ext

This is
how FILTER gets invoked if the address is a locally
defined mail alias (ext is the alias name).

The
rcptfilter invocation must terminate with a zero exit code
when the message originates from a mailing list or any other
source that should be considered as "whitelisted".
This filtering model does not fit very well with some mail
transfer protocols, so unless trusted sources are explicitly
declared to be whitelisted, there is a remote possibility
that the recipient will be removed from a mailing list
because of a poorly-written mail filter from some other
recipient of the same message. The 0 return exit code (which
is the implied default if no mail filtering is installed)
protects the recipient from being adversely affected, in any
way, by anyone else's mail filter.

The
mail filters may print a diagnostic message before rejecting
a message. The diagnostic message will be returned to the
sending mail relay, where possible.

The
mail filters inherit environment variables that describe the
incoming mail. The following environment variables are
provided by default:

SENDER

The
return address on the message.

TCPREMOTEHOST,
TCPREMOTEIP

When the
message is received via ESMTP, these variables specify the
remote IP address and the corresponding hostname. Hostname
is empty if the IP address does not have a reverse DNS
record, or is set to "softdnserr" if there was a
temporary failure while looking up this IP
address.

BLOCK2

The
default the Courier mail server configuration sets this
environment variable if the remote IP address is listed in
an unsecured relay blacklist. See /etc/courier/esmtpd for
more information. Other environment variables may also be
available. For mail received via ESMTP, environment
variables are usually set in the /etc/courier/smtpaccess
configuration file.

maildrop
implementation 
Maildrop implements this mail filtering API as
follows:

$HOME/.mailfilters

This
directory contains the filtering recipes. This directory,
and its contents, cannot have any group or world
permissions.

smtpfilter*,
rcptfilter*

These
mail filtering recipes directly correspond to the events
defined in the previous section. Maildrop's
"import" statement can be used to gain access to
the environment variables (these mail filters are executed
in maildrop's embedded mode). The mail filtering
recipes can set the EXITCODE variable appropriately
before terminating, in order to accept or reject the
message.

See
maildrop(1)
[2]
for more information.

Filtering
mail to aliases 
The /etc/courier/aliases configuration file is used to mail
aliases, see
makealiases(8)
[3]
. The system administrator may set
aside a reserved local account that will be used to specify
a local mail filter for messages addressed to aliases. The
configuration file /etc/courier/aliasfilteracct specifies
the home directory of the mail account that will be used to
filter alias recipients.

For
example, if /etc/courier/aliasfilteracct contains
/home/admin, then the Courier mail server runs the mail
filter as follows:

HOME=/home/admin
FILTER -D uid/gid -M
rcptfilter-alias-name

Here,
"uid/gid" is owner uid and gid of the specified
directory NOTE: "name" is a fully qualified
address, and the local aliases listed in
/etc/courier/aliases do not typically include the domain
name. If defines an alias called "system", for
example, the -M option will probably be
"system [AT] example.com", if example.com is the
contents of /etc/courier/me configuration file.

Unfortunately,
currently it is not possible to specify content filters
(a.k.a. smtpfilters) for aliases, only recipient
filters.
