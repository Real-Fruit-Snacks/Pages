DESCRIPTION

The kbdmux keyboard
driver provides support for basic keyboard multiplexing. It
is built around the idea of a &rsquo;&rsquo;super
keyboard&rsquo;&rsquo;. The kbdmux driver acts as a
master keyboard consuming input from all slave keyboards
attached to it.

Slave keyboards
can be attached to or detached from the kbdmux
keyboard driver with the kbdcontrol(1) utility.

HISTORY

The kbdmux module was
implemented in FreeBSD 6.0.

CAVEATS

The kbdmux keyboard
driver switches all slave keyboards into K_RAW mode. Thus
all slave keyboards attached to the kbdmux keyboard
share the same state. The kbdmux keyboard is
logically equivalent to one keyboard with lots of duplicated
keys.
