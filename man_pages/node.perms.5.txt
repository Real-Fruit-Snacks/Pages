NAME

node.perms
&minus; LinuxNode permissions file.

DESCRIPTION

Node.perms
file is read at program startup with the knowledge of users
username (call), connection type (AX.25, NET/ROM, ROSE,
TCP/IP), peers IP address (for TCP/IP) and port name (for
AX.25). The first entry matching this information is taken
and user is asked for password and given permissions
according to it.

The lines
within node.perms must either be a comment line,
which starts with a # in the first column, or a permission
entry in the following format, each field being delimited by
white space:

username type
portname password permissions
