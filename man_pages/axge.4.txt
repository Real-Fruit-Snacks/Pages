AXGE(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual AXGE(4)

NAME

axge â€” ASIX
Electronics AX88178A/AX88179 USB Gigabit Ethernet driver

SYNOPSIS

To compile this driver into the
kernel, place the following lines in your kernel
configuration file:

device xhci

device ehci 
device uhci 
device ohci 
device usb 
device miibus 
device uether 
device axge

Alternatively,
to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following line in loader.conf(5):

if_axge_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION

The axge driver provides
support for USB Gigabit Ethernet adapters based on the ASIX
Electronics AX88179 USB 3.0 and AX88178A USB 2.0
chipsets.

The AX88179 and
AX88178A contain a 10/100/1000 Ethernet MAC with a GMII
interface for interfacing with the Gigabit Ethernet PHY.

These devices
will operate with both USB 1.x and USB 2.0 controllers, and
the AX88179 will operate with USB 3.0 controllers. Packets
are received and transmitted over separate USB bulk transfer
endpoints.

The axge
driver supports the following media types:

autoselect

Enable
autoselection of the media type and options. The user can
manually override the autoselected mode by adding media
options to rc.conf(5).

10baseT/UTP

Set 10Mbps
operation. The ifconfig(8) mediaopt option can also
be used to select either full-duplex or
half-duplex modes.

100baseTX

Set 100Mbps
(Fast Ethernet) operation. The ifconfig(8) mediaopt
option can also be used to select either full-duplex
or half-duplex modes.

1000baseT

Set 1000Mbps
(Gigabit Ethernet) operation (AX88178 only). The ifconfig(8)
mediaopt option can also be used to select either
full-duplex or half-duplex modes.

The axge
driver supports the following media options:

full-duplex

Force full
duplex operation.

half-duplex

Force half
duplex operation.

For more
information on configuring this device, see ifconfig(8).
