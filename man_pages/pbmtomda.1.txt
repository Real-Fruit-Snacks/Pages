NAME
       pbmtomda - convert a PBM image to a Microdesign .mda

SYNOPSIS
       pbmtomda

       [-d] [-i] [--]

       [pbmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       pbmtomda  reads  a PBM image as input and produces a MicroDesign 2 area
       file (.MDA) as output.

       If you do not specify pbmfile, pbmtomda uses Standard Input.

OPTIONS
       In addition to the options common to all programs  based  on  libnetpbm
       (most notably -quiet, see
        Common  Options  ⟨index.html#commonoptions⟩ ), pbmtomda recognizes the
       following command line options:

       -d     Halve the height of the output file, to compensate for  the  as‐
              pect ratio used in MicroDesign files.

       -i     Invert the colors used.

       --     End of options (use this if the filename starts with "-")

LIMITATIONS
       There's no way to produce files in MicroDesign 3 format. MD3 itself and
       mdatopbm(1) can read files in either format.

       mdatopbm(1), pbm(1)
