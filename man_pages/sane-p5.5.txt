NAME
       sane-p5 - SANE backend for the Primax PagePartner

DESCRIPTION
       The sane-p5 library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) backend
       that provides access to the Primax PagePartner parallel port sheet  fed
       scanner.

       This  backend  handles 100, 150, 200, 300 and 600 dpi scan resolutions,
       in color and gray modes. The 600 dpi is actually 300x600 with lines en‐
       larged to match the vertical resolution.

       EPP/ECP  MODES ONLY The current version of the backend uses only EPP or
       ECP mode to communicate with the scanner. It is  recommended  that  you
       set  your parallel port to EPP in BIOS with the current version of this
       backend. ECPEPP will only work if you use a  2.4  or  2.6  kernel  with
       ppdev character device support.

DEVICE NAMES
       This backend expects device names of the form:

              port value

       Where value is :

              auto   autodetect all parallel ports and probe them for scanner

              /dev/parport0
                     uses  linux  ppdev  device,  depending  on  the number of
                     available parallel port, you have to  use  /dev/parport1,
                     /dev/parport2, ...

       You can rename any device using the

              option name my_name

       option. This option apply to the last port option.

CONFIGURATION
       Please  make  sure  to  edit dll.conf before you use the backend, since
       this backend isn't enabled by default.

FILES
       /etc/sane.d/p5.conf
              The  backend  configuration  file  (see  also   description   of
              SANE_CONFIG_DIR below).

       /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-p5.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-p5.so
              The shared library implementing this backend (present on systems
              that support dynamic loading).

ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_CONFIG_DIR
              This environment variable specifies the list of directories that
              may contain the configuration file.  On *NIX systems, the direc‐
              tories are separated by a colon (`:'), under OS/2, they are sep‐
              arated  by a semi-colon (`;').  If this variable is not set, the
              configuration file  is  searched  in  two  default  directories:
              first,   the   current  working  directory  (".")  and  then  in
              /etc/sane.d.  If the value of the environment variable ends with
              the  directory separator character, then the default directories
              are searched after the explicitly  specified  directories.   For
              example,  setting SANE_CONFIG_DIR to "/tmp/config:" would result
              in directories tmp/config, ., and /etc/sane.d being searched (in
              this order).

       SANE_DEBUG_P5
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this en‐
              vironment variable controls the debug level  for  this  backend.
              E.g.,  a  value  of 255 requests all debug output to be printed.
              Smaller levels reduce verbosity.

              level   debug output
              ------- ------------------------------
               0       critical errors
               1       errors
               2       warnings & minor errors
               4       information messages
               8       start/stop of functions
               16      tracing messages
               32      I/O functions
               64      I/O functions with traces
               128     scanned/calibration data

BUG REPORTS
       If  something  doesn't  work mail sane-devel@alioth-lists.debian.net or
       submit an issue via https://gitlab.com/sane-project/backends/issues/new
       with  a  label  of  backend/p5.  Please give as much information as you
       can.

       SANE version
              run "scanimage -V" to determine this

       the backend version and your scanner hardware
              run SANE_DEBUG_P5=255 scanimage -L 2>log as root. If  you  don't
              get any output from the p5 backend, make sure a line "p5" is in‐
              cluded into your /etc/sane.d/dll.conf.  If  your  scanner  isn't
              detected,  make  sure  you've defined the right port address, or
              the correct device in your p5.conf.

       the name of your scanner/vendor
              also a worthy information. Please also include the optical reso‐
              lution  and  lamp type of your scanner, both can be found in the
              manual of your scanner.

       any further comments
              if you have comments about the documentation (what could be done
              better),  or  you  think I should know something, please include
              it.
