NAME

pmnsadd
- add new names to the Performance Co-Pilot PMNS

SYNOPSIS

$PCP_BINADM_DIR/pmnsadd
[-?] [-n namespace] file

DESCRIPTION

pmnsmerge(1)
performs the same function as pmnsadd and is faster,
more robust and more flexible. It is therefore recommended
that pmnsmerge(1) be used instead.

pmnsadd
adds subtree(s) of new names into a Performance Metrics Name
Space (PMNS), as used by the components of the Performance
Co-Pilot (PCP).

Normally
pmnsadd operates on the default Performance Metrics
Name Space (PMNS), however if the -n option is
specified an alternative namespace is used from the file
namespace.

The default
PMNS is found in the file $PCP_VAR_DIR/pmns/root
unless the environment variable PMNS_DEFAULT is set,
in which case the value is assumed to be the pathname to the
file containing the default PMNS.

The new names
are specified in the file, arguments and conform to
the syntax for PMNS specifications, see PMNS(5).
There is one PMNS subtree in each file, and the base
PMNS pathname to the inserted subtree is identified by the
first group named in each file, e.g. if the
specifications begin

myagent.foo.stuff
{

mumble

123:45:1 
fumble

123:45:2

}

then the new
names will be added into the PMNS at the non-leaf position
identified by myagent.foo.stuff, and following all other
names with the prefix myagent.foo.

The new names
must be contained within a single subtree of the namespace.
If disjoint subtrees need to be added, these must be
packaged into separate files and pmnsadd used on
each, one at a time.

All of the
files defining the PMNS must be located within the directory
that contains the root of the PMNS, this would typically be
$PCP_VAR_DIR/pmns for the default PMNS, and this
would typically imply running pmnsadd as root.

As a special
case, if file contains a line that begins root { then
it is assumed to be a complete PMNS that needs to be merged,
so none of the subtree extraction and rewriting is performed
and file is handed directly to
pmnsmerge(1).

Provided some
initial integrity checks are satisfied, pmnsadd will
update the PMNS using pmnsmerge(1) - if this fails
for any reason, the original namespace remains
unchanged.

OPTIONS

The available
command line options are: 
-n pmnsfile

Load an alternative Performance
Metrics Name Space (PMNS(5)) from the file
pmnsfile.

-?

Display usage message and exit.

CAVEATS

Once the
writing of the new namespace file has begun, the
signals SIGINT, SIGHUP and SIGTERM will be ignored to
protect the integrity of the new files.

FILES

$PCP_VAR_DIR/pmns/root

the default PMNS, when the
environment variable PMNS_DEFAULT is unset

PCP ENVIRONMENT

Environment
variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On
each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains
the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).
