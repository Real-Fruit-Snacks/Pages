RELEASE NOTES FOR LIBGUESTFS 1.44

Language
bindings 
Python 2 support has been dropped. The minimum version of
Python required is 3.6.

Python bindings
no longer use deprecated
"PyEval_ThreadsInitialized".

Python bindings
now include type hints (Sam Eiderman).

Erlang bindings
now use libei instead of liberl_interface (Sergei
Golovan).

Tools 
virt-get-kernel(1) can now find uncompressed kernels
(Pino Toscano).

virt-sysprep(1)
now regenerates the guest certificate store when a
certificate is removed from the guest (Pino Toscano).

virt-sysprep(1)
can now remove IPA enrollment files and Kerberos keytabs
(Pino Toscano, Christian Heimes and Fran&ccedil;ois
Cami).

API

New APIs

"cryptsetup-open"
and "cryptsetup-close" replace
"luks-open", luks-open-ro and luks-close. The new
APIs add support for BitLocker encryption.

Other API
changes

"lvm-canonical-lv"
no longer produces a noisy error message when called with a
non-LV parameter.

Build
changes 
C programs using libguestfs can now be compiled against the
build directory:

../libguestfs/run
./configure 
../libguestfs/run make

OCaml
components are now linked correctly when building in a
different directory from the source (Geoff Toole).

GCC LTO is now
supported.

Weblate is now
used for localization instead of Zanata (Pino Toscano).

The
dependencies for guestfsd are no longer hard-coded but are
now generated from the built binary, ensuring that they
shouldn&rsquo;t get out of synch in future (Hilko
Bengen).

Internals

lib/guestfs.h was moved to include/guestfs.h in
the source. This is not an externally visible change but
affected a lot of places inside the build system.
