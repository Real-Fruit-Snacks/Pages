NAME

xmode2 - Show
the pulse/space length of infrared signals

SYNOPSIS

xmode2
[options]

DESCRIPTION

The main
purpose of xmode2 is to check operation of your
home-brew LIRC receiver hardware and to see the IR waveform
of the remote controller without an expensive oscilloscope.
Very useful for debugging. Of course this program
won&rsquo;t work with hardware that decodes the signals
itself like e.g. TV cards or the Irman i. e., it only works
with LIRC_MODE_MODE2 type drivers.

xmode2
prints a simple graphics display of the pulse/space lengths.
It accepts a few commands including time base changes; see
the xmode2 -h output.

lirc-lsplugins(1)
allows checking if a driver is a LIRC_MODE2 type one.

OPTIONS

RUNNING AS ROOT

In many cases
xmode2 needs to run as root to access devices not available
to regular users. On the other hand, running as root creates
problems such as log files owned by root, security concerns
etc.

In order to
cope with this, xmode2 by default drops root privileges
after opening the input device. This support is based on
that root permissions are acquired using sudo(1) e. g.,
using

$ sudo xmode2
--driver default --device /dev/lirc0

If not using
sudo, the same behaviour could be accomplished using the
SUDO_USER environment variable e. g.,

#
SUDO_USER=$LOGNAME xmode2 --raw /dev/lirc0

The --keep-root
option will make xmode2 keep it&rsquo;s root privileges for
the complete run.

DRIVER LOADING

Drivers are
loaded dynamically. The search path used for this is
determined by (falling priority):

-

The --plugindir option.

-

The &rsquo;plugindir&rsquo; entry in the [lircd] section
of the lirc_options.conf file.

-

The environment variable LIRC_PLUGINDIR.

-

A hardcoded default (usually
/usr/lib[64]/lirc/plugins). 

FILES

~/.cache/xmode2.log

Debug output. Setting the
XDG_CACHE_HOME environment variable relocates this file to
$XDG_CACHE_HOME/mode2.log
