- extract metric help text for a PMDA

C SYNOPSIS

#include

#include 

int
pmdaText(int ident, int type,
char **buffer, pmdaExt
*pmda);

DESCRIPTION

As part of the
Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) API (see
PMDA(3)), pmdaText uses the standard
PMDA(3) data structures to return the help text for
metric ident in buffer. The help text must be
located in help text files created with newhelp(1),
and the associated files are automatically opened by
pmdaInit(3).

The path to the
(basename of the) help text files can be set in the calls to
pmdaDSO(3) or pmdaDaemon(3) and overridden by
the -h command line option in
pmdaGetOpt(3).

The encoding of
ident follows the internal scheme used below the
routines pmLookupText(3) and
pmLookupInDomText(3), namely ident encodes
either a metric identifier or an instance domain identifier,
according to the value of type.

The type
argument is a bit mask that encodes the interpretation of
ident and the requested form of help text, as
follows: either PM_TEXT_PMID if ident is a
metric identifier, or PM_TEXT_INDOM if ident
is an instance domain identifier, plus either
PM_TEXT_ONELINE for the one line help text or
PM_TEXT_HELP for the full help text.

The
buffer is managed internally (usually it is cached),
and it should not be released or freed by the caller
of pmdaText.

CAVEAT

The PMDA must
be using PMDA_PROTOCOL_2 or later, as specified in
the call to pmdaDSO(3) or pmdaDaemon(3).

DIAGNOSTICS

If the
requested help text could not be obtained, pmdaText
will return PM_ERR_TEXT.
