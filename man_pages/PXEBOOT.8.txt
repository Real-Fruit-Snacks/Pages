PXEBOOT(8) BSD System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
PXEBOOT(8)

NAME

pxeboot &mdash; Preboot
Execution Environment (PXE) bootloader

DESCRIPTION

The pxeboot bootloader is
a modified version of the system third-stage bootstrap
loader(8) configured to run under Intel&rsquo;s Preboot
Execution Environment (PXE) system. PXE is a form of smart
boot ROM, built into Intel EtherExpress Pro/100 and 3Com
3c905c Ethernet cards, and Ethernet-equipped Intel
motherboards. PXE supports DHCP configuration and provides
low-level NIC access services. The pxeboot bootloader
retrieves the kernel, modules, and other files either via
NFS over UDP or by TFTP, selectable through compile-time
options. In combination with a memory file system image or
NFS-mounted root file system, pxeboot allows for
easy, EEPROM-burner free construction of diskless
machines.

The
pxeboot binary is loaded just like any other boot
file, by specifying it in the DHCP server&rsquo;s
configuration file. Below is a sample configuration for the
ISC DHCP v2 server:

option
domain-name "example.com"; 
option routers 10.0.0.1; 
option subnet-mask 255.255.255.0; 
option broadcast-address 10.0.0.255; 
option domain-name-servers 10.0.0.1; 
server-name "DHCPserver"; 
server-identifier 10.0.0.1;

default-lease-time
120; 
max-lease-time 120;

subnet 10.0.0.0
netmask 255.255.255.0 { 
filename "pxeboot"; 
range 10.0.0.10 10.0.0.254; 
}

pxeboot
recognizes next-server and option root-path
directives as the server and path to NFS mount for file
requests, respectively, or the server to make TFTP requests
to. Note that pxeboot expects to fetch
/boot/loader.rc from the specified server before
loading any other files.

In all other
respects, pxeboot acts just like loader(8).

As PXE is still
in its infancy, some firmware versions may not work
properly. The pxeboot bootloader has been extensively
tested on version 0.99 of Intel firmware; pre-release
versions of the newer 2.0 firmware are known to have
problems. Check with the device&rsquo;s manufacturer for
their latest stable release.
