PKCS15-PROFILE(5)             OpenSC File Formats            PKCS15-PROFILE(5)

NAME
       pkcs15-profile - format of profile for pkcs15-init

DESCRIPTION
       The pkcs15-init utility for PKCS #15 smart card personalization is
       controlled via profiles. When starting, it will read two such profiles
       at the moment, a generic application profile, and a card specific
       profile. The generic profile must be specified on the command line,
       while the card-specific file is selected based on the type of card
       detected.

       The generic application profile defines general information about the
       card layout, such as the path of the application DF, various PKCS #15
       files within that directory, and the access conditions on these files.
       It also defines general information about PIN, key and certificate
       objects. Currently, there is only one such generic profile,
       pkcs15.profile.

       The card specific profile contains additional information required
       during card initialization, such as location of PIN files, key
       references etc. Profiles currently reside in @pkgdatadir@

SYNTAX
       This section should contain information about the profile syntax. Will
       add this soonishly.
