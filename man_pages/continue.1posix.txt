PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       continue — continue for, while, or until loop

SYNOPSIS
       continue [n]

DESCRIPTION
       If n is specified, the continue utility shall return to the top of  the
       nth  enclosing  for,  while, or until loop. If n is not specified, con‐
       tinue shall behave as if n was specified as 1. Returning to the top  of
       the loop involves repeating the condition list of a while or until loop
       or performing the next assignment of a for loop, and  re-executing  the
       loop if appropriate.

       The  value of n is a positive decimal integer. If n is greater than the
       number of enclosing loops, the outermost enclosing loop shall be  used.
       If there is no enclosing loop, the behavior is unspecified.

       The  meaning  of ``enclosing'' shall be as specified in the description
       of the break utility.
