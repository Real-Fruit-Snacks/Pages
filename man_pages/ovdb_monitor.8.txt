NAME

ovdb_monitor -
Database maintenance

SYNOPSIS

Use
ovdb_init to start ovdb_monitor

DESCRIPTION

When started
(normally by ovdb_init that is invoked by
rc.news), ovdb_monitor forks three processes
that perform routine database maintenance tasks. These are
transaction checkpointing (every 30 seconds), deadlock
detection (every 30 seconds), and transaction log removal
(every 45 seconds).

The process ID
of the parent is written to ovdb_monitor.pid in the
pathrun directory. This PID is used by other INN
commands to verify that ovdb_monitor is running.

To shut down
ovdb_monitor, send a TERM signal to the process ID in
ovdb_monitor.pid. The parent process will shut down
the three children and wait for their exit before exiting
itself. Note that when running the "rc.news stop"
command to stop the news system, rc.news
automatically takes care of stopping
ovdb_monitor.
