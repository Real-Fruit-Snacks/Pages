PTSNAME(3POSIX)            POSIX Programmer's Manual           PTSNAME(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       ptsname — get name of the slave pseudo-terminal device

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdlib.h>

       char *ptsname(int fildes);

DESCRIPTION
       The ptsname() function shall return the name of the slave pseudo-termi‐
       nal  device associated with a master pseudo-terminal device. The fildes
       argument is a file descriptor that refers to the master device. The pt‐
       sname()  function  shall  return  a  pointer to a string containing the
       pathname of the corresponding slave device.

       The ptsname() function need not be thread-safe.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, ptsname()  shall  return  a  pointer  to  a
       string  which  is  the  name  of the pseudo-terminal slave device. Upon
       failure, ptsname() shall return a null pointer and may set errno.  This
       could occur if fildes is an invalid file descriptor or if the slave de‐
       vice name does not exist in the file system.

       The application shall not modify  the  string  returned.  The  returned
       pointer might be invalidated or the string content might be overwritten
       by a subsequent call to ptsname().  The returned pointer and the string
       content might also be invalidated if the calling thread is terminated.

ERRORS
       The ptsname() function may fail if:

       EBADF  The fildes argument is not a valid file descriptor.

       ENOTTY The  file  associated  with  the fildes argument is not a master
              pseudo-terminal device.
