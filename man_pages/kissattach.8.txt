NAME

kissattach,
spattach - Attach a KISS or 6PACK interface

SYNOPSIS

kissattach
[-b] [-6] [-l] [-m mtu] [-v] [-i inetaddr] tty port
[inetaddr]

spattach
[-b] [-6] [-l] [-m mtu] [-v] [-i inetaddr] tty port
[inetaddr]

DESCRIPTION

Attach a KISS
or a 6PACK interface to what is normally a tty line
connected to a TNC in KISS or 6PACK mode. This program will
turn itself into a background process. To down an interface
send its attach process a SIGTERM.

Kissattach
takes many of the parameters for the port from the
axports(5) file. If the speed parameter in the file is not
equal to zero then it is used for the serial port speed, a
zero value means that no speed is set. The paclen parameter
is used for the device mtu unless overridden by a value on
the command line.

The tty
argument will typically be that of a serial port with a KISS
or 6PACK TNC attached, although it could be a pseudo tty or
a KISS port emulator such as an SCC card. Kissattach
supports BSD-style pseudo-terminals as well as the Unix98
pty&rsquo;s. If the tty argument is "/dev/ptmx",
then Unix98 behaviour will automatically take effect. With
Unix98 pty&rsquo;s, the slave tty name could not be forseen.
That&rsquo;s why kissattach will print the corresponding
slave pty name as a separate line on stdout.

The port
argument is the name of a port as given in the axports(5)
file.

The optional
inetaddr argument is the IP address of the new interface.
Some time it was mandatory argument (although due to
historical reasons this restriction is lifted if the old -i
option is used). But there&rsquo;s really not a need for the
interface to have an IP address assigned to.

OPTIONS

-6

Use the 6PACK line discipline
instead of KISS. This is the default if the program is
called as spattach so the option is a no-op for
spattach. 

-i inetaddr

Set the internet address of the interface. This address
may either be a dotted decimal address or a host name. This
option is now depreciated and the program will complain
about it, though still work.

-l

Log messages to the system log, the default is not
to. 

-b

Allow broadcasts on the interface (default no - because
for e.g. samba broadcasts are a pain..)

-m mtu

Sets the mtu of the interface. If this value is not
given then the value is taken from the paclen parameter in
axports. 

-v

Display the version.
