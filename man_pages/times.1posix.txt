PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding

       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       times — write process times

SYNOPSIS
       times

DESCRIPTION
       The times utility shall write the accumulated user and system times for
       the  shell  and  for all of its child processes, in the following POSIX
       locale format:

           "%dm%fs %dm%fs\n%dm%fs %dm%fs\n", <shell user minutes>,
               <shell user seconds>, <shell system minutes>,
               <shell system seconds>, <children user minutes>,
               <children user seconds>, <children system minutes>,
               <children system seconds>

       The four pairs  of  times  shall  correspond  to  the  members  of  the
       <sys/times.h>  tms structure (defined in the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, Chapter 13, Headers) as returned by  times():  tms_utime,
       tms_stime, tms_cutime, and tms_cstime, respectively.
