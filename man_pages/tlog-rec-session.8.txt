NAME

tlog-rec-session
- start a shell and log terminal I/O

SYNOPSIS

tlog-rec-session
[OPTION...] [CMD_FILE [CMD_ARG...]] 
tlog-rec-session -c [OPTION...] CMD_STRING [CMD_NAME
[CMD_ARG...]]

DESCRIPTION

Tlog-rec-session
is a terminal session I/O logging program, intended for use
as the login shell for a user. The actual user shell to
start is retrieved from configuration or environment.
Tlog-rec-session starts the actual shell under a pseudo-TTY,
connects it to the actual terminal and logs whatever passes
between them including user input, program output, and
terminal window size changes.

Tlog-rec-session
will not start recording if another process with the same
audit session ID (as seen in /proc/PID/sessionid) is already
being recorded. Instead, it will simply start the shell.

If no
"-c" option is specified, then the first
non-option argument CMD_FILE specifies the location of a
shell script the shell should read and the following
arguments (CMD_ARG) specify its arguments.

If the
"-c" option is specified, then a non-option
argument CMD_STRING is required and should contain shell
commands to execute, the following arguments can specify
first the script name (CMD_NAME, i.e. argv[0]) and then its
arguments (CMD_ARG).

If no
non-option arguments are encountered, or the "-i"
option is specified then the shell is started
interactively.

If
tlog-rec-session is invoked under a name beginning with a
dash (i.e. argv[0] beginning with ’-’), then the
executed shell name is also prepended with a dash. This
passes the "login shell" status to the recorded
shell and is equivalent to using the "-l"
option.

If
tlog-rec-session is invoked under a name containing
"-shell-", then the rest of the name after that
string is considered an encoded absolute path to the shell
to execute for the recorded session. The path is expected to
be encoded by replacing all forward slashes ’/’
with dashes ’-’ and any characters to be
preserved as is prepended with a backslash ’\’.
E.g. to have tlog-rec-session execute /bin/dash as the
shell, invoke it with the name
"tlog-rec-session-shell-bin-dash".

This is
normally done by making a symlink with that name pointing to
tlog-rec-session, and then executing the link. Such links
can be assigned to users as their shells to have specific
shells started under recording for specific users.

Tlog-rec-session
loads its parameters first from the system-wide
configuration file /etc/tlog/tlog-rec-session.conf, then
from the file pointed at by TLOG_REC_SESSION_CONF_FILE
environment variable (if set), then from the contents of the
TLOG_REC_SESSION_CONF_TEXT environment variable (if set),
and then from command-line options. Parameters from each of
these sources override the previous one in turn.

OPTIONS

General
options 
-h, --help

Output a command-line usage
message and exit.

-v, --version

Output version information and
exit.

--configuration

Output program configuration in
JSON and exit.

-l, --login

Make the shell a login
shell.

If specified,
the shell is signalled to act as a login shell. This is done
by prepending argv[0] of the shell with a dash
character.

-i, --interactive

Make the shell an interactive
shell.

If specified,
tlog-rec-session passes the -i option to the shell.

-c, --command

Execute shell commands.

If specified,
tlog-rec-session passes the -c option to the shell, followed
by all the positional arguments, which specify the shell
commands to execute along with command name and its
arguments.

ENVIRONMENT

TLOG_REC_SESSION_CONF_FILE

Specifies the location of a
configuration file to be read. The configuration parameters
in this file override the ones in the system-wide
configuration file /etc/tlog/tlog-rec-session.conf.

TLOG_REC_SESSION_CONF_TEXT

Specifies the configuration
text to be read. The configuration parameters in this
variable override the ones in the file specified with
TLOG_REC_SESSION_CONF_FILE.

TLOG_REC_SESSION_SHELL

Specifies the shell to spawn.
Overrides configuration specified with
TLOG_REC_SESSION_CONF_TEXT. Can be overridden by invoking
tlog-rec-session under a special name (see above).

FILES

/etc/tlog/tlog-rec-session.conf

The system-wide configuration
file

EXAMPLES

Start recording
a login shell:

tlog-rec-session -l

Ask the recorded shell to
execute a command:

tlog-rec-session -c
