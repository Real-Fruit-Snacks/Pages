NAME
       gh-codespace-ssh - SSH into a codespace

SYNOPSIS
       gh codespace ssh [<flags>...] [-- <ssh-flags>...] [<command>]

DESCRIPTION
       The  'ssh'  command  is  used  to SSH into a codespace. In its simplest
       form, you can run 'gh cs ssh', select a  codespace  interactively,  and
       connect.

       By default, the 'ssh' command will create a public/private ssh key pair
       to
       authenticate with the codespace inside the ~/.ssh directory.

       The 'ssh' command also supports deeper integration with OpenSSH using a
       '--config'  option  that  generates  per-codespace ssh configuration in
       OpenSSH format.  Including this configuration in your ~/.ssh/config im‚Äê
       proves  the  user experience of tools that integrate with OpenSSH, such
       as bash/zsh completion of ssh hostnames,  remote  path  completion  for
       scp/rsync/sshfs, git ssh remotes, and so on.

       Once  that  is  set  up  (see the second example below), you can ssh to
       codespaces as if they were ordinary remote hosts (using 'ssh', not  'gh
       cs ssh').

       Note  that  the codespace you are connecting to must have an SSH server
       pre-installed.  If the docker image being used for the  codespace  does
       not  have  an  SSH  server,  install  it  in  your  Dockerfile  or, for
       codespaces that use Debian-based images, you can add the  following  to
       your devcontainer.json:

       "features":     {         "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/sshd:1":    {
                 "version": "latest"      } }

OPTIONS
       -c, --codespace <string>
              Name of the codespace

       --config
              Write OpenSSH configuration to stdout

       -d, --debug
              Log debug data to a file

       --debug-file <string>
              Path of the file log to

       --profile <string>
              Name of the SSH profile to use

       --server-port <int>
              SSH server port number (0 => pick unused)

EXAMPLE
              $ gh codespace ssh

              $ gh codespace ssh --config > ~/.ssh/codespaces
              $ printf 'Match all\nInclude ~/.ssh/codespaces\n' >> ~/.ssh/config
