NAME

gh-codespace-ssh
- SSH into a codespace

SYNOPSIS

gh codespace
ssh [...] [-- ...]
[]

DESCRIPTION

The ssh
command is used to SSH into a codespace. In its simplest
form, you can run gh cs ssh, select a codespace
interactively, and connect.

The ssh
command will automatically create a public/private ssh key
pair in the ~/.ssh directory if you do not have an
existing valid key pair. When selecting the key pair to use,
the preferred order is:

1.

Key specified by -i in

2.

Automatic key, if it already exists

3.

First valid key pair in ssh config (according to ssh
-G) 

4.

Automatic key, newly created

The ssh
command also supports deeper integration with OpenSSH using
a --config option that generates per-codespace ssh
configuration in OpenSSH format. Including this
configuration in your ~/.ssh/config improves the user
experience of tools that integrate with OpenSSH, such as
Bash/Zsh completion of ssh hostnames, remote path completion
for scp/rsync/sshfs, git ssh remotes, and so
on.

Once that is
set up (see the second example below), you can ssh to
codespaces as if they were ordinary remote hosts (using
ssh, not gh cs ssh).

Note that the
codespace you are connecting to must have an SSH server
pre-installed. If the docker image being used for the
codespace does not have an SSH server, install it in your
Dockerfile or, for codespaces that use Debian-based
images, you can add the following to your
devcontainer.json:

"features":
{

"ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/sshd:1": {

"version": "latest"

}

}
