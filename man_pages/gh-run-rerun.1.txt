NAME

gh-run-rerun -
Rerun a run

SYNOPSIS

gh run rerun
[] [flags]

DESCRIPTION

Rerun an entire
run, only failed jobs, or a specific job from a run.

Note that due
to historical reasons, the --job flag may not take
what you expect. Specifically, when navigating to a job in
the browser, the URL looks like this:
//actions/runs//jobs/https://github.com///actions/runs//jobs/;.

However, this
 should not be used with the
--job flag and will result in the API returning
404 NOT FOUND. Instead, you can get the correct job
IDs using the following command:

gh run view
 --json jobs --jq ’.jobs[] | {name,
databaseId}’

OPTIONS

-d,
--debug

Rerun with debug logging

--failed

Rerun only failed jobs,
including dependencies

-j, --job

Rerun a specific job from a
run, including dependencies

OPTIONS INHERITED FROM PARENT COMMANDS

-R,
--repo 

Select another repository using
the [HOST/]OWNER/REPO format
