configuration file:

device usb

device ucom

DESCRIPTION

The umct driver provides
support for USB to RS-232 converters based on the Magic
Control Technology USB-232 design. These devices support
most of the standard RS-232 features including baud rates
ranging from 300 to 115200 bits per second. However, neither
hardware nor software flow control seems to be
supported.

Access to
devices under this driver is via the ucom(4) framework and
device nodes.
