FD(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual FD(4)

NAME

fd, stdin,
stdout, stderr â€” file descriptor
files

DESCRIPTION

The files /dev/fd/0
through /dev/fd/# refer to file descriptors which can
be accessed through the file system. If the file descriptor
is open and the mode the file is being opened with is a
subset of the mode of the existing descriptor, the call:

fd =
open("/dev/fd/0", mode);

and the
call:

fd = fcntl(0,
F_DUPFD, 0);

are
equivalent.

Opening the
files /dev/stdin, /dev/stdout and
/dev/stderr is equivalent to the following calls:

fd =
fcntl(STDIN_FILENO, F_DUPFD, 0); 
fd = fcntl(STDOUT_FILENO, F_DUPFD, 0); 
fd = fcntl(STDERR_FILENO, F_DUPFD, 0);

Flags to the
open(2) call other than O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY and O_RDWR are
ignored.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

By default, /dev/fd is
provided by devfs(5), which provides nodes for the first
three file descriptors. Some sites may require nodes for
additional file descriptors; these can be made available by
mounting fdescfs(5) on /dev/fd.
