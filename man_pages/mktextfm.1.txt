NAME

mktextfm -
create a TFM file for a font

SYNOPSIS

mktextfm
[options] font

DESCRIPTION

mktextfm
is used to generate a tfm file from the Metafont source
files for font, or hbf2gf(1), if possible. If
destdir is given, the generated file will be
installed there, otherwise a (rather complicated) heuristic
is used. If the tfm file already exists in the destination
location, this is reported and nothing is done.

If a GF
(Generic Font) bitmap file is also generated, as is typical
with &Mu;F, it is converted to PK (Packed Font) and
installed similarly.

The full
pathname of the generated file is printed on standard
output.

If available,
the mf-nowin(1) variant of Metafont is used to
generate fonts to avoid the possibility of online
display.

mktextfm
is typically called by other programs, via Kpathsea, rather
than from the command line.

OPTIONS

mktextfm
accepts the following options: 
--destdir dir

A directory name. If the
directory is absolute, it is used as-is. Otherwise, it is
appended to the root destination directory set in the
script.

--help

Print help message and exit successfully.

--version

Print version information and
exit successfully.

ENVIRONMENT

One environment
variable is specific to mktextfm:
MF_MODE_EXTRA_INFO. If this is set to a non-empty
value, a Metafont macro mode_include_extra_info will
be invoked when the font is made. The standard
modes.mf file defines this, as of modes.mf version
4.0, released in 2020. This causes the so-called Xerox-world
information, notably including the CODINGSCHEME for
the font, to be included in the tfm file. (This is not done
by default since it is too intrusive to redefine the
necessary primitives, per Don Knuth.) The mftrace(1)
program, for example, can use this to get a clue about the
font encoding, although the information is not always
perfectly definitive or unambiguous.

For more about
the encodings of Metafont fonts, see the section
&rsquo;&rsquo;Bitmap font encodings&rsquo;&rsquo; in the
Dvips manual (e.g.,
https://tug.org/texinfohtml/dvips.html).

The many other
environment variables and various configuration files that
control a TeX system also affect the behavior of
mktextfm, as usual.
