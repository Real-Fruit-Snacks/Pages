NAME

dpt-takeover --
take over a package for the Debian Perl Group

SYNOPSIS

dpt
takeover -t top-directory [option...]
package...

DESCRIPTION

dpt
takeover helps taking over a package and adopting its
control files for maintenance by the Debian Perl group.

dpt
takeover first creates a local Git repository either
from existing Git repository specified with the -g
option, or by importing all package versions available on
snapshot.debian.org via gbp-import-dscs(1).

Next dpt
takeover adds suitable entries to
debian/changelog, using information given by the
-m or the -a options.

Next dpt
takeover runs "dpt-packagecheck -a -A -C
-c" to adjust the control fields.

Finally, the
resulting Git repository is pushed to the Debian
collaborative server, salsa.debian.org, unless the -n
option is used.
