NAME

nbd_set_request_block_size
- control whether NBD_OPT_GO requests block size

SYNOPSIS

#include

int nbd_set_request_block_size ( 
struct nbd_handle *h, bool request 
);

DESCRIPTION

By default,
when connecting to an export, libnbd requests that the
server report any block size restrictions. The NBD protocol
states that a server may supply block sizes regardless of
whether the client requests them, and libnbd will report
those block sizes (see nbd_get_block_size(3));
conversely, if a client does not request block sizes, the
server may reject the connection instead of dealing with a
client sending unaligned requests. This function makes it
possible to test server behavior by emulating older
clients.

Note that even
when block size is requested, the server is not obligated to
provide any. Furthermore, if block sizes are provided
(whether or not the client requested them), libnbd enforces
alignment to those sizes unless
nbd_set_strict_mode(3) is used to bypass client-side
safety checks.

RETURN VALUE

If the call is
successful the function returns 0.

ERRORS

On error -1 is
returned.

Refer to
"ERROR HANDLING" in libnbd(3) for how to
get further details of the error.

The following
parameters must not be NULL: "h". For more
information see "Non-NULL parameters" in
libnbd(3).
