NAME
       fairymax - xboard-compatible chess and chess-variant engine 'Fairy-Max'

SYNOPSIS
       fairymax [hashSize] [iniFile]

       shamax [hashSize] [iniFile]

       maxqi [hashSize] [iniFile]

DESCRIPTION
       fairymax is a program that plays chess and chess variants.  It uses the
       xboard/winboard chess-engine protocol to communicate.  Apart from
       'regular' chess (also known as the Mad-Queen variant), it can play
       Capablanca chess, gothic chess, janus chess, knightmate, cylinder
       chess, berolina chess, superchess, makruk (Thai chess, and also some of
       its variants, Cambodian chess (Ouk), asean chess and ai-wok), courier
       chess, Seirawan chess, Spartan chess, falcon chess, great shatranj,
       team-mate chess, charge of the light brigade, king of the hill,
       bifurcator chess, Los-Alamos chess, Mexican chess, Ciccolini's chess,
       grande acedrex, wildebeest chess (almost), shuffle chess without
       castling and chess with different armies (all combinations of the FIDE,
       Clobberers, Nutters and Rookies armies).  Fairy-Max can be easily
       configured by the user to play other variants as well, by modifying the
       ini file.  This ini file describes the rules of movement of the
       participating pieces and the initial board setup.

       Fairy-Max can also play shatranj, but in this case is not aware of the
       shatranj rule that a bare king loses.  So it might play sub-optimally
       in the late end-game.  A version of Fairy-Max adapted to implement the
       baring rule (and the rule that stalemate is a win) is available under
       the name shamax.  Grande Acedrex and Courier Chess might also have had
       a baring rule, so you may want to play these with shamax instead of
       fairymax too.

       Similarly, a version of Fairy-Max adapted to play Xiang Qi (Chinese
       Chess) is included in the fairymax package as well, under the name
       maxqi.

       fairymax is a derivative of the world's (once) smallest chess program
       (source-code wise), micro-Max.  The latter measures less that 2000
       characters, (about 100 code lines), and has a computer rating of around
       2050 on the CCRL rating list.  Although this is about 1000 rating
       points behind the world champion, micro-Max still makes a quite tough
       opponent even for club players, although it is not unbeatable.

       The main difference between micro-Max and Fairy-Max is that the latter
       loads its move-generator tables, which specify how the various pieces
       move, from an external file, so it can be easily adapted to incorporate
       un-orthodox pieces.  For ease of use of the artificial-intelligence,
       Fairy-Max is equipped with I/O routines that allow it to run with the
       xboard graphical user interface.

       See xboard(6) for instructions about how to use fairymax through
       xboard. To start up quickly, you just need the command: xboard -fcp
       fairymax.  Note that to be able to play the chess variants, it is
       recommended to use the latest XBoard version, as some of the recently
       added variants will use features not supported by older XBoard versions
       (in particular allowing an engine to reconfigure XBoard's ideas on the
       initial setup and how the pieces move).  Problems with older XBoard
       versions might range from only being able to play the variant with
       legality testing switched off, inability to display some of the
       unorthodox pieces in board sizes other than Bulky, Middling or Petite,
       not recognizing variants with non-standard names, to refusing even
       names that by now are standard XBoard variants.

       For some variants even the name is unknown to XBoard, and they are all
       grouped under the catchall name 'fairy'.  Which variant is played by
       Fairy-Max when XBoard is set to 'fairy', can be determined by a
       combobox control in the XBoard 'Engine Settings' menu dialog.  This
       currently applies to the various army combinations of chess with
       different armies.  After having set this Variant fairy selects option,
       activating XBoard's New game menu when already in variant fairy, or
       selecting fairy from the New variant menu dialog will then start the
       selected game.

       Fairymax supports multi-PV mode: by specifying a non-zero multi-PV
       margin in the Engine-Settings dialog of XBoard, Fairy-Max will not only
       print the principal variation for the best move, but also for every
       move that approaches the score of this best move to within the set
       margin.  (If it does not find the best move on the first try, this
       might lead to printing of a few extra lines below the threshold.)
       Fairy-Max now also supports analysis mode, and exclusion of moves from
       the analysis.

       The fmax.ini file from which Fairy-Max by default takes the piece and
       game definitions is a self-documenting text file, which contains
       instructions for how to define new pieces and chess variants.  In
       addition it contains an extensive list of pre-defined pieces, incuding
       many not occurring in any of the pre-defined variants, which the user
       can draw on to define his own variants.

       Amongst the move types supported by Fairy-Max are normal leaper and
       slider moves, (e.g. knight and rook), divergent moves (i.e. capture and
       non-capture moves can be different), hoppers (which jump over other
       pieces, such as the Chinese cannon or the grasshopper), lame leapers
       (the move of which can be blocked on squares they cannot move to, such
       as the Chinese horse and elephant), limited-range sliders (upto range
       5), and any combination thereof, in every possible direction.  The
       board width is configurable upto a width of 14 files, and cylindrical
       boards (where left and right edge connect) are supported as well.  The
       board height can be configured up to 16 ranks.

OPTIONS
       hashSize
               If the first argument to fairymax is numeric, it is taken as an
               indicator for the amount of memory Fairy-Max is allowed to use
               for its internal hash table.  The default value for this
               argument, 22, would result in a memory usage of 48MB.  Each
               next-higher number doubles the memory usage, each next-lower
               halves it.  Running with less than 6MB (i.e. argument 19) is
               not recommended.  When fairymax is running under xboard 4.3.15
               or later the hash-table size can be set through the xboard
               menus, making this argument superfluous.

       iniFile A second or non-numeric first argument is taken as a filename.
               Fairy-Max will use the mentioned file in stead of its default
               fmax.ini file to define the movement of pieces and initial
               setup of the variants.  This makes it easier to define your own
               variants.

       INTERACTIVE OPTIONS
               Fairy-Max also supports some options that can only be set
               interactively, though XBoard's engine settings menu dialog.
               These include a setting to further define -variant fairy, (e.g.
               which armies to pit against each other in chess with different
               armies), and whether makruk is to be played with Thai or
               Cambodian rules (the latter requiring XBoard's legality testing
               to be switched off!).  You can also enable resigning, and set a
               score threshold for when Fairy-Max should do it, and define the
               already mentioned multi-PV margin there.  An 'Info' button in
               the settings dialog makes XBoard pop up a window with some info
               about the currently selected variant.

       Persistent hash
               Some of the interactive options can be used to store the
               current position in a file bearing the name of the variant
               being played, with the extension '.hash' added to it, during
               analysis.  Positions in that file will be loaded into
               Fairy-Max' hash table before every game, protected from
               overwrite.  This can be used to create an opening or end-game
               book for the variant.  The Save in hash file button is
               convenient for saving the occasional position.  For saving many
               positions in a row the option Automatic pesistent-hash dialog
               can be ticked.  This pops up a dialog at the start of every
               analysis search, in which the user then just has to press 'OK'
               to put the score from the analysis into the hash file.  If a
               number is typed in that dialog before pressing 'OK', the
               position will be saved with that score (in centi-Pawn) rather
               than the score determined by the engine's own analysis.  This
               can for instance be used to discourage opening lines the engine
               overrates.  The file will be created in the current directory,
               but at the start of a game both this file, as well as one in
               Fairy-Max' private data files, will be loaded.  The install
               does contain such a persistent hash file for makruk, to help
               Fairy-Max find the checkmate in the 'difficult' corners of the
               KMMMK and KNMMK (with like M) end-games.
