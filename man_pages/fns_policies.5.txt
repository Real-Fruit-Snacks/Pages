fns_policies
− overview of the FNS Policies

DESCRIPTION

FNS
defines policies for naming objects in the federated
namespace. The goal of these policies is to allow easy and
uniform composition of names. The policies use the basic
rule that objects with narrower scopes are named relative to
objects with wider scopes.

FNS
policies are described in terms of the following three
categories: global, enterprise, and application. 
Global naming service

A global naming service is a
naming service that has world-wide scope. Internet
DNS and X.500 are examples of global naming services.
The types of objects named at this global level are
typically countries, states, provinces, cities, companies,
universities, institutions, and government departments and
ministries. These entities are referred to as
enterprises.

Enterprise-level naming
service

Enterprise-level naming
services are used to name objects within an enterprise.
Within an enterprise, there are naming services that provide
contexts for naming common entities such as 
organizational units, physical sites, human users, and
computers. Enterprise-level naming services are bound below
the global naming services. Global naming services provide
contexts in which the root contexts of enterprise-level
naming services can be bound.

Application-level naming
service

Application-level naming
services are incorporated in applications offering services
such as file service, mail service, print service, and so
on. Application-level naming services are bound below
enterprise naming services. The enterprise-level naming
services provide contexts in which contexts of
application-level naming services can be bound.

FNS has
policies for global and enterprise naming. Naming within
applications is left to individual applications or groups of
related applications and not specified by FNS.

FNS
policy specifies that DNS and X.500 are global naming
services that are used to name enterprises. The global
namespace is named using the name .... A DNS
name or an X.500 name can appear after the ....
Support for federating global naming services is planned for
a future release of FNS.

Within an
enterprise, there are namespaces for organizational units,
sites, hosts, users, files and services, referred to by the
names orgunit, site, host, user,
fs, and service. In addition, these namespaces
can be named using these names with an added underscore
(’_’) prefix (for example, host and
_host have the same binding). The following table
summarizes the FNS policies.

In Solaris, an
organizational unit name corresponds to an NIS+
domain name and is identified using either the
fully-qualified form of its NIS+ domain name, or its
NIS+ domain name relative 
to the NIS+ root. Fully-qualified NIS+ domain
names have a terminal dot (’.’). For
example, assume that the NIS+ root domain is
"Wiz.COM." and "sales" is a subdomain of
that. Then, the names org/sales.Wiz.COM. and
org/sales both refer to the organizational unit
corresponding to the same NIS+ domain
sales.Wiz.COM.

User names
correspond to names in the corresponding NIS+
passwd.org_dir table. The file system context
associated with a user is obtained from his entry in the
NIS+ passwd.org_dir table.

Host names
correspond to names in the corresponding NIS+
hosts.org_dir table. The file system context
associated with a host corresponds to the files systems
exported by the host.

EXAMPLES

Example 1:
The types of objects that may be named relative to an
organizational unit name are: user, host, service, file, and
site. Here are some examples of names name objects relative
to organizational unit names: 

org/accounts_payable.finance/site/videoconference.northwing

names a conference room
videoconference located in the north wing of the site
associated with the organizational unit
accounts_payable.finance.

org/finance/user/mjones

names a user mjones in
the organizational unit finance.

org/finance/host/inmail

names a machine inmail
belonging to the organizational unit finance.

org/accounts_payable.finance/fs/pub/blue-and-whites/FY92-124

names a file
pub/blue-and-whites/FY92-124 belonging to the
organizational unit accounts_payable.finance.

org/accounts_payable.finance/service/calendar

names the calendar
service of the organizational unit
accounts_payable.finance. This might manage the
meeting schedules of the organizational unit.

Example 2:
The types of objects that may be named relative to a site
name are services and files. Here are some examples of names
that name objects relative to sites: 
site/b5.mtv/service/printer/speedy

names a printer speedy
in the b5.mtv site.

site/admin/fs/usr/dist

names a file directory
usr/dist available in the site admin.

Example 3:
The types of objects that may be named relative to a user
name are services and files. Here are some examples of names
that name objects relative to users: 
user/jsmith/service/calendar

names the 
calendar service of the user jsmith.

user/jsmith/fs/bin/games/riddles

names the file
bin/games/riddles of the user jsmith.

Example 4:
The types of objects that may be named relative to a host
name are services and files. Here are some examples of names
that name objects relative to hosts: 
host/mailhop/service/mailbox

names the 
mailbox service associated with the machine
mailhop.

host/mailhop/fs/pub/saf/archives.91

names the directory
pub/saf/archives.91 found under the root directory of
the machine mailhop.
