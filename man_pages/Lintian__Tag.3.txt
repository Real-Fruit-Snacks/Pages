Lintian::Tag(3)             Debian Package Checker             Lintian::Tag(3)

NAME
       Lintian::Tag - Lintian interface to tag metadata

SYNOPSIS
           my $tag = Lintian::Tag->new;

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides an interface to tag metadata as gleaned from the
       *.desc files describing the checks.  It can be used to retrieve
       specific metadata elements or to format the tag description.

INSTANCE METHODS
       name
       visibility
       check
       name_spaced
       show_always
       experimental
       explanation
       see_also
       renamed_from
       profile
       load(PATH)
           Loads a tag description from PATH.

       code()
           Returns the one-letter code for the tag.  This will be a letter
           chosen from "E", "W", "I", or "P", based on the tag visibility, and
           other attributes (such as whether experimental is set).  This code
           will never be "O" or "X"; overrides and experimental tags are
           handled separately.
