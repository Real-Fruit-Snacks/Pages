NAME

sqlr-listener
− connect to a TCP port and wait for queries

SYNOPSIS

sqlr-listener
[−id ID] [−config
CONFIGFILE]

DESCRIPTION

The job of the
sqlr-listener is to connect to a TCP port and wait
for queries. When it gets one, it waits for an available
connection daemon, hands off the query to it, waits for the
result set, and hands the result set back to the client.

OPTIONS

CONFIGFILE
is the filename of the configuration file to use. The
default configuration file is
/etc/sqlrelay/sqlrelay.conf.

ID is
the same as the ID argument in the
sqlr-connection daemon and associates a listener with
a pool of connections.

Only one
listener needs to be established for a given ID.
