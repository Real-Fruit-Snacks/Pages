PERIODIC(8)

NAME

periodic &mdash; run
periodic system functions

SYNOPSIS

periodic directory
...

DESCRIPTION

The periodic utility is
intended to be called by cron(8) to execute shell scripts
located in the specified directory.

One or more of
the following arguments must be specified:

daily

Perform the
standard daily periodic executable run. This usually occurs
early in the morning (local time).

weekly

Perform the
standard weekly periodic executable run. This usually occurs
on Sunday mornings.

monthly

Perform the
standard monthly periodic executable run. This usually
occurs on the first day of the month.

security

Perform the standard daily
security checks. This is usually spawned by the daily
run.

path

An arbitrary
directory containing a set of executables to be run.

If an argument
is an absolute directory name it is used as is, otherwise it
is searched for under /etc/periodic and any other
directories specified by the local_periodic setting
in periodic.conf(5) (see below).

The
periodic utility will run each executable file in the
directory or directories specified. If a file does not have
the executable bit set, it is silently ignored.

Each script is
required to exit with one of the following values:

0

The script has
produced nothing notable in its output. The &lang;

basedir &rang; _show_success variable
controls the masking of this output.

1

The script has
produced some notable information in its output. The
&lang;

basedir &rang; _show_info variable
controls the masking of this output.

2

The script has
produced some warnings due to invalid configuration
settings. The &lang;

basedir &rang; _show_badconfig variable
controls the masking of this output.

>2

The script has
produced output that must not be masked.

If the relevant
variable (where &lang; basedir&rang; is the base
directory in which the script resides) is set to
&rsquo;&rsquo;NO&rsquo;&rsquo; in periodic.conf,
periodic will mask the script output. If the variable
is not set to either &rsquo;&rsquo;YES&rsquo;&rsquo; or
&rsquo;&rsquo;NO&rsquo;&rsquo;, it will be given a default
value as described in periodic.conf(5).

All remaining
script output is delivered based on the value of the
&lang;

basedir &rang; _output setting.

If this is set
to a path name (beginning with a &rsquo;/&rsquo; character),
output is simply logged to that file. newsyslog(8) knows
about the files /var/log/daily.log,
/var/log/weekly.log and /var/log/monthly.log,
and if they exist, it will rotate them at the appropriate
times. These are therefore good values if you wish to log
periodic output.

If the
&lang;

basedir &rang; _output value does not
begin with a &rsquo;/&rsquo; and is not empty, it is assumed
to contain a list of email addresses, and the output is
mailed to them.

If &lang;

basedir &rang; _output is not set or is
empty, output is sent to standard output.

ENVIRONMENT

The periodic utility sets
the PATH environment to include all standard system
directories, but no additional directories, such as
/usr/local/bin. If executables are added which depend
upon other path components, each executable must be
responsible for configuring its own appropriate
environment.

FILES 
/etc/crontab

the
periodic utility is typically called via entries in
the system default cron(8) table

/etc/periodic

the top level
directory containing daily, weekly, and
monthly subdirectories which contain standard system
periodic executables

/etc/defaults/periodic.conf

the
periodic.conf system registry contains variables that
control the behaviour of periodic and the standard
daily, weekly, and monthly scripts

/etc/periodic.conf

this file
contains local overrides for the default periodic
configuration

EXAMPLES

The system crontab should have
entries for periodic similar to the following
example:

# do
daily/weekly/monthly maintenance 
0 2 * * * root periodic daily 
0 3 * * 6 root periodic weekly 
0 5 1 * * root periodic monthly

The
/etc/defaults/periodic.conf system registry will
typically have a local_periodic variable reading:

local_periodic="/usr/local/etc/periodic
/usr/X11R6/etc/periodic"

To log
periodic output instead of receiving it as email, add
the following lines to /etc/periodic.conf:

daily_output=/var/log/daily.log

weekly_output=/var/log/weekly.log 
monthly_output=/var/log/monthly.log

To only see
important information from daily periodic jobs, add the
following lines to /etc/periodic.conf:

daily_show_success=NO

daily_show_info=NO 
daily_show_badconfig=NO

DIAGNOSTICS

Exit status is 0 on success and
1 if the command fails for one of the following reasons:

usage:
periodic   No
directory path argument was passed to periodic to
specify where the script fragments reside.

not found  Self explanatory.

HISTORY

The periodic utility
first appeared in FreeBSD 3.0.

BUGS

Since one specifies information
about a directory using shell variables containing the
string, &lang; basedir&rang; , &lang;
basedir&rang; must only contain characters that are
valid within a sh(1) variable name, alphanumerics and
underscores, and the first character may not be numeric.
