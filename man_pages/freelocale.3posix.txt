PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       freelocale — free resources allocated for a locale object

SYNOPSIS
       #include <locale.h>

       void freelocale(locale_t locobj);

DESCRIPTION
       The freelocale() function shall cause the resources allocated for a lo‐
       cale  object returned by a call to the newlocale() or duplocale() func‐
       tions to be released.

       The behavior is undefined if the locobj argument is the special  locale
       object LC_GLOBAL_LOCALE or is not a valid locale object handle.

       Any use of a locale object that has been freed results in undefined be‐
       havior.

RETURN VALUE
       None.

ERRORS
       None.

EXAMPLES
   Freeing Up a Locale Object
       The following example shows a code fragment to  free  a  locale  object
       created by newlocale():

           #include <locale.h>
           ...

           /* Every locale object allocated with newlocale() should be
            * freed using freelocale():
            */

           locale_t loc;

           /* Get the locale. */

           loc = newlocale (LC_CTYPE_MASK | LC_TIME_MASK, "locname", NULL);

           /* ... Use the locale object ... */
           ...

           /* Free the locale object resources. */
           freelocale (loc);

APPLICATION USAGE
       None.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
