NAME

xawtv - a X11
program for watching TV

SYNOPSIS

xawtv [
options ] [ station name ]

DESCRIPTION

xawtv is
a X11 application for watching TV with your unix box. It
uses the Athena widgets.

OPTIONS

All command
line options also have a Resource, so you can put them into
your .Xdefaults file too. 
-h, -help

Print a short description of
all command line options.

-hwscan

Print a list of available
devices.

-f,
-fullscreen

startup in fullscreen mode.

Resource: xawtv.fullscreen (bool).

-n, -noconf

don&rsquo;t read the config
file ($HOME/.xawtv). 
Resource: xawtv.readconfig (bool).

-o, -outfile
base

set basestring for the snapshot
output files. The filename will be
"base-timestamp-nr.ext". 
Resource: xawtv.basename (string).

-c, -device
device

set video4linux device (default
is /dev/video0). This option also disables Xvideo support.

Resource: xawtv.device (string).

-D, -driver
name

set video4linux driver (default
is "libv4l"). This option also disables Xvideo
support. 
Resource: xawtv.driver (string).

-C, -dspdev
device

set audio device (default is
/dev/dsp). 
Resource: xawtv.dspdev (string).

-vbidev device

set vbi device (default is
/dev/vbi0). 
Resource: xawtv.vbidev (string).

-c, -xvport
number

set Xvideo port (defaults to
the first usable if Xvideo is available). This option also
enables Xvideo support. 
Resource: xawtv.xvport (int).

-joydev device

joystick device to use for
controlling xawtv. 
Resource: xawtv.joydev (string).

-v, -debug
level

Be verbose, level may be
0 (default), 1 or 2. It exists just for debugging and
trouble-shooting. 
Resource: xawtv.debug (int).

-remote

X11 display is remote. This
basically disables overlay mode, you might need this if
xawtv fails to autodetect a remote X11 display. 
Resource: xawtv.remote (bool).

-b, -bpp n

force xawtv into n bpp
color depth. Works for switching between 15/16 and 24/32
bpp. This gets just passed through to v4l-conf(8). 
Resource: xawtv.bpp (int).

-shift n

Shift the video display by
n bytes. Try this if your video display isn&rsquo;t
within the xawtv window, some older matrox cards show this
problem. This gets passed through to v4l-conf(8) too. 
Resource: xawtv.shift (int).

-fb

Use the framebuffer device to determine the video
framebuffer address (instead of the DGA extension). Yet
another pass through argument.

Resource: xawtv.fbdev
(bool).

-xv/-noxv

enable/disable the usage of the
Xvideo extension altogether, i.e. -noxv has the same effect
as both -noxv-video and -noxv-image switches (see below).

Resource: xawtv.xv (bool).

-xv-video/-noxv-video

enable/disable the usage of the
Xvideo extension for video overlay (i.e. XvPutVideo).
overlay mode uses this. default is on. 
Resource: xawtv.xvVideo (bool).

-xv-image/-noxv-image

enable/disable the usage of the
Xvideo extension for image scaling (i.e. XvPutImage).
grabdisplay mode uses this. default is on. 
Resource: xawtv.xvImage (bool).

-vm/-novm

enable/disable the usage of the
VidMode extension, default is off. If there is a fullscreen
video mode configured in the config file, the vidmode
extension will be enabled automatically. 
Resource: xawtv.vidmode (bool).

-dga/-nodga

enable/disable the usage of the
DGA extension, default is on. 
Resource: xawtv.dga (bool).

-parallel n

use n compression threads
(default: one). 
Resource: xawtv.parallel (int).

The usual
toolkit options like -geometry are supported too.

SUPPORTED HARDWARE / INTERFACES

v4l2

video4linux two - modern
standard linux video capture API

libv4l

work through the libv4l library, which provides an
additional thin layer on top of video4linux2 devices for
support of more wide range of devices&rsquo; pixel formats
(often required for webcams etc.) It is default for Xawtv on
Linux systems.

bktr

FreeBSD / OpenBSD driver for bt848/878 grabber
cards. 

Xvideo

X11 Extension for video devices. Note that the Xvideo
extension does support overlay only, you can&rsquo;t capture
images/movies if the Xvideo extension is used. On the other
hand this is the only way to scaled video overlay (i.e.
fullscreen without black borders @ 1024x748) if both
hardware and xfree86 driver support it. See README.xfree4
for more details and hints on how to setup Xvideo.

GETTING STARTED

Just start
xawtv. Then verify the settings in the options menu (right
mouse button) and adjust the settings (TV norm, Video
source, frequency table). With the cursor keys you can
control the tuner and look for TV Stations. Other useful
hotkeys are listed below.

The hotkey
&rsquo;E&rsquo; will show the channel editor where you can
create/edit entries your TV stations. Don&rsquo;t forget to
click on "save" to write a config file. You can
also create/edit a config file with any text editor, see
xawtvrc(5) for a description of the config file syntax.
There are a number of config options which can only be set
by editing the config file.

You can also
check out scantv. That&rsquo;s a command line tool which
will perform a channel scan and write out a xawtv config
file with all channels it has found.

Mouse
functions 
The left mouse button will popup a menu with all TV stations
found in the config file. The middle button switches to the
next station. The right button brings up a window with a lot
of options and control functions.

BUGS

Bug reports
with images attached go to /dev/null unseen.

xawtv depends
on a correct driver configuration. If you can&rsquo;t tune
TV stations even if the settings in the options window are
correct it is very likely a driver issue.

The mono/stereo
display is not reliable due to v4l API restrictions.
The API can not report back the current audio mode, but a
list of the currently available modes. xawtv just does a
guess based on that, assuming the driver uses the best
available mode. Depending on your hardware this might not be
true. If in doubt whenever stereo really works,
please tune in MTV and listen, don&rsquo;t trust what xawtv
says.
