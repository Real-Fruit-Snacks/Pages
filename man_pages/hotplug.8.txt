SYNOPSIS

hotplug
[ help | --help | NAME ]

/etc/init.d/hotplug
[start|stop|status|force-reload|restart]

DESCRIPTION

hotplug
is a program which is used by the kernel to notify user mode
software when some significant (usually hardware-related)
events take place. An example is when a USB or Cardbus
device has just been plugged in. This is useful for
automatically loading and setting up drivers, packaged
either as kernel modules or as user mode programs.

The hotplug
program path name is registered in
/proc/sys/kernel/hotplug, and normally holds the
value /sbin/hotplug. Except for specialized
configurations such as initrd(4) configurations, that
identifies a shell script which delegates to specific
"policy agents", /etc/hotplug/NAME.agent.
The name of the agent is given by the kernel as the first
command-line parameter. The name corresponds to a specific
kernel subsystem whose events it processes (e.g.
"usb", "pci", "net" etc.).

Information
about an event is passed in the form of environment
variables. Most agents accept a "ACTION" variable
that describes the type of the event. It is set to
"add" or "remove" to signify that some
device has just been connected to or disconnected from the
system. 
The location of the device is provided in the variable
"DEVPATH". With kernel version 2.5 and later it is
set to the corresponding sysfs device path without the
mountpoint but a leading slash.

hotplug
agents aren&rsquo;t necessarily called only by the kernel
though. While the OS is initializing, the
"cold-plugging" case, the hotplug script in
/etc/init.d/hotplug is invoked to make sure that all
device connected at boot are properly configured, applying
the same rules as if they were connected later.

Hotplug agents
should be used to dynamically adapt to system configuration
changes. It helps to think of them as just delivering events
from different layers of the Linux software. So low level
bus framework code will deliver events when new physical
devices are plugged in, and bus agents make sure the
device&rsquo;s driver is loaded, configured, and activated.
(They use depmod(8) style device descriptions, used
among other things to publish MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE entries
found in the source to kernel mode device drivers.) Then
other layers in the Linux stack will take over, reporting
higher level events like "there is a new network
interface". Agents at those levels tend to have more
complex tasks.

When used
during system initialization, hotplugging may be called
"coldplugging" to highlight certain problems. For
example, program files and data needed to run hotplug agents
might be on filesystems that aren&rsquo;t yet available.
