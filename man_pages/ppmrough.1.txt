NAME
       ppmrough  - create PPM image of two colors with a ragged border between
       them

SYNOPSIS
       ppmrough

       [-left pixels]

       [-right pixels]

       [-top pixels]

       [-bottom pixels]

       [-width pixels]

       [-height pixels]

       [-bg colorspec]

       [-fg colorspec]

       [-var pixels]

       [-randomseed seed]

       [-verbose]

       All options can be abbreviated to their shortest  unique  prefix.   You
       may  use  two  hyphens instead of one.  You may separate an option name
       and its value with white space instead of an equals sign.

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       ppmrough generates a PPM image of the specified width, height, and col-
       ors.   ppmrough  tiles  the  image into semi-rectangular regions with a
       ragged borders between  them.   It  calculates  the  fluctuations  with
       pseudo-random numbers.

       ppmrough writes the PPM image to Standard Output.

       The  maxval  of  the  output  image  is  255  (You can change this with
       pamdepth).

       Use the options -left or -right, respectively, to  make  vertical  bor-
       ders, and -top or -bottom, respectively, to generate horizontal borders
       inside the image.  Each of these options needs an integer value  pixels
       that  determines the average distance of the interior border to the re-
       lated edge of the image.  You may combine the -left, -right, -top,  and
       -bottom  options  to  generate an image with more than one border.  The
       algorithm ensures that you can concatenate two images produced with the
       same (i.e. -left) value without dislocations.

       You  specify  the dimensions of the generated image with the -width and
       -height options.

       Use the -bg and -fg options to set the background  (margin)  color  and
       the  foreground  (interior)  color, respectively.  If you don't specify
       any of the -left, -right, -top, and -bottom options, all pixels are set
       to foreground color.  The defaults are white foreground and black back-
       ground.

       Use the -var option to control the "raggedness"  of  the  border.   The
       less  its  value is the smoother the border is.  You can initialize the
       pseudo-random generator with the -init option.

       You could use ppmrough with ppmtopgm to create a PGM transparency  mask
       and use it to roughen up the edges of another image.

OPTIONS
       In  addition  to  the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm
       (most notably -quiet, see
        Common Options <index.html#commonoptions> ), ppmrough  recognizes  the
       following command line options:

       -left=pixels
               Specifies  the mean distance of the border from the left margin
              (default: no border).

       -right=pixels
              Specifies the mean distance of the border from the right  margin
              (default: no border).

       -top=pixels
              Specifies  the  mean  distance of the border from the top margin
              (default: no border).

       -bottom=pixels
              Specifies the mean distance of the border from the bottom margin
              (default: no border).

       -width=pixels
              Specifies the width of the image (default: 100).

       -height=pixels
              Specifies the height of the image (default: 100).

       -bg=colorspec
              Background color.  colorspec is as described for the argument of
              the          pnm_parsecolor()          library           routine
              <libnetpbm_image.html#colorname> .  Default is black.

       -fg=color
              Foreground color.  colorspec is as described for the argument of
              the          pnm_parsecolor()          library           routine
              <libnetpbm_image.html#colorname> .  Default is white.

       -var=pixels
               Specifies the variance of the ragged border (default: 10). Must
              be a positive integer.  Set pixels to 1 to get a  straight  bor-
              der.

       -randomseed=seed
              Use this option to initialize the pseudo-random number generator
              with seed.

              You can use this to cause the program to produce repeatable out-
              put.

              Before  Netpbm  10.61 (December 2012), this is called -init, and
              that still works.

       -verbose
              Run ppmrough in verbose mode.   It  reports  all  parameters  on
              Standard Error.
