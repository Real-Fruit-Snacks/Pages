NAME

cmap_iter_next
- Return next item in iteration in CMAP

SYNOPSIS

#include

cs_error_t
cmap_iter_next(cmap_handle_t handle,
cmap_iter_handle_t iter_handle, char
key_name[], size_t *value_len,
cmap_value_types_t *type);

DESCRIPTION

The
cmap_iter_next function is used to get next value in
iteration. The handle argument is connection to CMAP
database obtained by calling cmap_initialize(3)
function. iter_handle argument is iterator handle
obtained by cmap_iter_init(3) function. Following key
name is stored inside key_name argument, which must
be preallocated by caller and its guaranteed maximum size is
CMAP_KEYNAME_MAXLEN (currently 255). value_len is
pointer where length of value is stored, but can be NULL.
type is also optional argument (can be NULL) and here
type of value is stored (type is one of types described in
cmap_get(3) function).

RETURN VALUE

This call
returns the CS_OK value if successful. If there are no more
items to iterate, CS_NO_SECTION error code is returned.
