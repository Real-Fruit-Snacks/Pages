DESCRIPTION

epm
generates software packages complete with installation,
removal, and (if necessary) patch scripts. Unless otherwise
specified, the files required for product are read
from a file named "product.list".

The -a
option ("architecture") specifies the actual
architecture for the software. Without this option the
generic processor architecture is used ("intel",
"sparc", "mips", etc.)

The -f
option ("format") specifies the distribution
format:

aix

Generate an AIX distribution suitable for installation
on an AIX system.

bsd

Generate a BSD distribution suitable for installation on
a FreeBSD, NetBSD, or OpenBSD system.

deb

Generate a Debian distribution suitable for installation
on a Debian Linux system.

inst, tardist

Generate an IRIX distribution
suitable for installation on an system running IRIX.

lsb, lsb-signed

Generate RPM packages for
LSB-conforming systems. The lsb-signed format uses the GPG
private key you have defined in the ~/.rpmmacros file.

native

Generate an native
distribution. This uses rpm for Linux, inst
for IRIX, pkg for Solaris, swinstall for
HP-UX, bsd for FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD, and
osx for MacOS X. All other operating systems default
to the portable format.

osx

Generate a MacOS X software package.

pkg

Generate an AT&T software package. These are used
primarily under Solaris.

portable

Generate a portable
distribution based on shell scripts and tar files. The
resulting distribution is installed and removed the same way
on all operating systems. [default]

rpm, rpm-signed

Generate a Red Hat Package
Manager ("RPM") distribution suitable for
installation on a Red Hat Linux system. The rpm-signed
format uses the GPG private key you have defined in the
~/.rpmmacros file.

setld

Generate a Tru64 (setld)
software distribution.

slackware

Generate a Slackware Linux
software distribution.

swinstall, depot

Generate a HP-UX software
distribution.

Executable
files in the distribution are normally stripped of debugging
information when packaged. To disable this functionality use
the -g option.

Intermediate
(spec, etc.) files used to create the distribution are
normally removed after the distribution is created. The
-k option keeps these files in the distribution
directory.

The -s
and --setup-image options ("setup") include
the ESP Software Wizard with the specified GIF or XPM image
file with the distribution. This option is currently only
supported by portable and RPM distributions.

The
--setup-program option specifies the setup executable
to use with the distribution. This option is currently only
supported by portable distributions.

The
--setup-types option specifies the setup.types
file to include with the distribution. This option is
currently only supported by portable distributions.

The
--output-dir option specifies the directory to place
output file into. The default directory is based on the
operating system, version, and architecture.

The -v
option ("verbose") increases the amount of
information that is reported. Use multiple v&rsquo;s for
more verbose output.

The
--depend option lists the dependent (source) files
for all files in the package.

Distributions
normally are named
"product-version-system-release-machine.ext" and
"product-version-system-release-machine-patch.ext"
(for patch distributions.) The
"system-release-machine" information can be
customized or eliminated using the -n option with the
appropriate trailing letters. Using -n by itself will
remove the "system-release-machine" string from
the filename entirely. The
"system-release-machine" information can also be
customized by using the -m option with an arbitrary
string.

Debian, IRIX,
portable, and Red Hat distributions use the extensions
".deb", ".tardist", "tar.gz",
and ".rpm" respectively.

LIST FILES

The EPM list
file format is now described in the epm.list(5) man
page.

KNOWN BUGS

EPM does not
currently support generation of IRIX software patches.
