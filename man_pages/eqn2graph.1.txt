Description

eqn2graph
reads a one-line eqn(1) equation from the standard
input and writes an image file, by default in Portable
Network Graphics (PNG) format, to the standard output.

The input EQN
code should not be preceded by the .EQ macro
that normally precedes it within groff(1) macros; nor
do you need to have dollar-sign or other delimiters around
the equation.

Arguments not
recognized by eqn2graph are passed to the ImageMagick
or GraphicsMagick program convert(1). By specifying
these, you can give your image a border, set the
image&rsquo;s pixel density, or perform other useful
transformations.

The output
image is clipped using convert&rsquo;s -trim
option to the smallest possible bounding box that contains
all the black pixels.

Options

--help
displays a usage message, while -v and
--version show version information; all exit
afterward. 
-format output-format

Write the image in
output-format, which must be understood by
convert; the default is PNG.
