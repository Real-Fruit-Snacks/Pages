NAME
       Font::TTF::PSNames - Utilities for Postscript glyph name processing

SYNOPSIS
         use Font::TTF::PSNames qw(parse lookup);
         $name = lookup($uni);
         $uni = parse($name);

METHODS
   lookup ( $usv [, $noAlt [, $noUni] ])
       return the Adobe-recommended glyph name for a specific Unicode
       codepoint (integer). By default returns "uniXXXX" names rather than
       "afiiNNNNN" or "SFnnnnnn" names

       If $noAlt is true, "afii" and "SF" names are returned rather than
       "uniXXXX".

       if $noUni is true, returns undef if it would have to resort to
       "uniXXXX" or "uXXXXXX" style names. Essentially this represents a
       straight lookup in the Adobe-recommended list.

   parse ( $glyphname )
       Parse an Adobe-conformant glyph name, generating a Unicode codepoint
       sequence equivalent to the glyph (or glyph components, should the name
       represent a ligature). In scalar context, returns a reference to an
       array of Unicodes (decimal). Array is empty if the glyph name is non-
       conformant.  In list context, the first item returned is the same array
       reference as above. The second item is a reference to an array
       containing the extensions (if any) present on the glyph name.  The '.'
       that precedes each extension is not included.
