NAME

cryptsetup-close
- removes the existing mapping  (and the
associated key)

SYNOPSIS

cryptsetup
close [] 

DESCRIPTION

Removes the
existing mapping  and wipes the key from kernel
memory.

For backward
compatibility, there are close command aliases:
remove, plainClose, luksClose,
loopaesClose, tcryptClose, bitlkClose
(all behave exactly the same, device type is determined
automatically from the active device).

can be [--deferred, --cancel-deferred, --header,
--disable-locks].

OPTIONS

--batch-mode,
-q

Suppresses all confirmation
questions. Use with care!

If the
--verify-passphrase option is not specified, this option
also switches off the passphrase verification.

--cancel-deferred

Removes a previously configured
deferred device removal in close command.

--debug or
--debug-json

Run in debug mode with full
diagnostic logs. Debug output lines are always prefixed by
#.

If --debug-json
is used, additional LUKS2 JSON data structures are
printed.

--deferred

Defers device removal in
close command until the last user closes it.

--disable-locks

Disable lock protection for
metadata on disk. This option is valid only for LUKS2 and
ignored for other formats.

WARNING:
Do not use this option unless you run cryptsetup in a
restricted environment where locking is impossible to
perform (where /run directory cannot be used).

--header

Use a detached (separated)
metadata device or file where the LUKS header is stored.
This option allows one to store ciphertext and LUKS header
on different devices.

For commands
that change the LUKS header (e.g. luksAddKey),
specify the device or file with the LUKS header directly as
the LUKS device.

--help,
-?

Show help text and default
parameters.

--usage

Show short option help.

--version,
-V

Show the program version.

REPORTING BUGS

Report bugs at
cryptsetup mailing list
cryptsetup [AT] lists.dev> or in Issues project
section
https://gitlab.com/cryptsetup/cryptsetup/-/issues/new>.

Please
attach output of the failed command with --debug option
added.
