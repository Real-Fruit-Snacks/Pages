NAME

pmdabcc
- BCC PMDA

DESCRIPTION

pmdabcc
is a Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) Performance Metrics Domain
Agent (PMDA) which extracts live performance data from
extended BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) in-kernel programs by
using BCC (BPF Compiler Collection) Python frontend.

pmdabcc
loads and acts as a bridge for any number of configured,
separate PCP BCC PMDA Python modules running BPF programs.
Existing BCC Python tools and programs should be possible to
be utilized with PCP BCC PMDA modules with reasonable
effort.

See the BPF and
BCC documentation for detailed description of both.

CONFIGURATION

pmdabcc
reads a mandatory ini-style configuration file:

$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/bcc/bcc.conf

This file must
contain a [pmda] section. The following PMDA options
are available (their default values are shown in
parenthesis), options marked with asterisk (*) can be
overridden in module-specific configuration sections:

modules (unset)

The pmdabcc PMDA reads
module-specific configuration for each module listed in the
comma-separated list of modules (mandatory).

prefix (bcc.)
*

By default, all metrics from
the modules will appear under the bcc Performance
Metrics Name Space (PMNS) tree, prefix (optional) can
be used to change this generic prefix.

process_refresh
(0)

See below.

module_failure_fatal
(True)

A boolean value for
module_failure_fatal (optional) controls whether a
module failing to compile should cause the whole PMDA to
abort (this is the default) or to start up with possibly
remaining functional modules. Module configuration errors
and internal errors (such as failing to register the
provided PMNS metrics, see PMNS(5)) will always cause
the PMDA to fail.

Of particular
note, the process option accepted by some modules
evalutes the given PIDs and process names at PMDA/module
initialization time and apply filtering for only those
processes found at that stage. This is due to fact that the
in-kernel BPF program is compiled at module initialization
time and, even more importantly, they are often running at
performance critical areas where it is not acceptable to do
process name lookups each time a request is processed by the
BPF program. To allow modules to monitor named processes
(say, process = java) even if they restart the
process_refresh should be set to a non-negative
integer N to dynamically refresh monitored processes
every N seconds. In case new processes matching the
process filter have appeared, the currently running BPF is
detached and a new BPF program with updated PID information
is installed (and if no PIDs matching the filter are anymore
present, the BPF program will be detach to avoid any
needless overhead).

For each
module listed in modules a corresponding
[module] section must be defined containing at least
the following options:

module

Defines the actual Python module file name to be loaded
during PMDA startup under the modules subdirectory of
the PCP BCC PMDA installation.

cluster

Specifies the unique cluster ID (see PMNS(5)) for
the metrics provided by the module under the PMNS path.

All modules
accept but not necessarily use the boolean debug
option.

Modules may
also support additional module-specific configuration
options, refer to the default configuration file for their
supported options.

INSTALLATION

To install, the
following must be done as root:

# cd
$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/bcc 
# ./Install

To uninstall,
the following must be done as root:

# cd
$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/bcc 
# ./Remove

pmdabcc
is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be executed
directly. The Install and Remove scripts
notify pmcd(1) when the agent is installed or
removed.

In case
module_failure_fatal is set to False, the PMDA
installation will be considered successful even if some or
even all configured modules fail to load, in such cases
metric values provided by the failing modules will not be
available. The pmdabcc agent log file (see below)
will contain detailed information about activation of each
module.

Some modules
will start providing values only after having collected data
from related system activity. For instance, the
tcpperpid module will not provide any values unless
there are processes generating TCP traffic on the
system.

FILES

$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/bcc/bcc.conf

configuration file for the
pmdabcc agent

$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/bcc/modules/*.{py,python}

PCP BCC PMDA Python modules
available for the pmdabcc agent

$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/bcc/Install

installation script for the
pmdabcc agent

$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/bcc/Remove

undo installation script for
the pmdabcc agent

$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/bcc.log

default log file for messages
from the pmdabcc agent

Note that the
usual/default value for $PCP_PMDAS_DIR is
/var/lib/pcp/pmdas and the default for
$PCP_LOG_DIR is /var/log/pcp but these
settings are platform dependent.

PCP ENVIRONMENT

Environment
variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On
each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains
the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).
