KILLPG(3POSIX)             POSIX Programmer's Manual            KILLPG(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       killpg — send a signal to a process group

SYNOPSIS
       #include <signal.h>

       int killpg(pid_t pgrp, int sig);

DESCRIPTION
       The killpg() function shall send the signal specified  by  sig  to  the
       process group specified by pgrp.

       If  pgrp  is  greater  than 1, killpg(pgrp, sig) shall be equivalent to
       kill(-pgrp, sig). If pgrp is less than or equal to 1, the  behavior  of
       killpg() is undefined.

RETURN VALUE
       Refer to kill().

ERRORS
       Refer to kill().

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
   Sending a Signal to All Other Members of a Process Group
       The following example shows how the calling process could send a signal
       to all other members of its process group. To prevent itself  from  re‐
       ceiving the signal it first makes itself immune to the signal by ignor‐
       ing it.

           #include <signal.h>
           #include <unistd.h>
           ...
               if (signal(SIGUSR1, SIG_IGN) == SIG_ERR)
                   /* Handle error */;

               if (killpg(getpgrp(), SIGUSR1) == -1)
                   /* Handle error */;"

APPLICATION USAGE
       None.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
