NAME
       Glib::Param::Int64 -  Wrapper for int64 parameters in GLib

HIERARCHY
         Glib::ParamSpec
         +----Glib::Param::Int64

DESCRIPTION
       This page documents the extra accessors available for the signed 64 bit
       integer type paramspecs.  On 32 bit machines and even on some 64 bit
       machines, perl really only supports 32 bit integers, so all of these
       methods convert the values to and from Perl strings if necessary.

METHODS
   64 bit integer = $pspec->get_maximum
   64 bit integer = $pspec->get_minimum
SEE ALSO
       Glib, Glib::ParamSpec
