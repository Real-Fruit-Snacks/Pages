NAME

processor_info
− determine type and status of a processor

SYNOPSIS

#include

#include 

int
processor_info(processorid_t processorid,
processor_info_t *infop);

DESCRIPTION

The
processor_info() function returns the status of the
processor specified by processorid in the
processor_info_t structure pointed to by
infop.

The structure
processor_info_t contains the following members:

int      pi_state;
char     pi_processor_type[PI_TYPELEN];
char     pi_fputypes[PI_FPUTYPE];
int      pi_clock;

The
pi_state member is the current state of the
processor, either P_ONLINE, P_OFFLINE, or
P_POWEROFF.

The
pi_processor_type member is a null-terminated ASCII
string specifying the type of the processor.

The
pi_fputypes member is a null-terminated ASCII string
containing the comma-separated types of floating-point units
(FPUs) attached to the processor. This string will be empty
if no FPU is attached.

The
pi_clock member is the processor clock frequency
rounded to the nearest megahertz. It may be 0 if not
known.

RETURN VALUES

Upon successful
completion, 0 is returned. Otherwise, −1
is returned and errno is set to indicate the
error.

ERRORS

The
processor_info() function will fail if: 
EINVAL

An non-existent processor
ID was specified.

EFAULT

The processor_info_t
structure pointed to by infop was not writable by the
user.
