utility for displaying information on software packages

DESCRIPTION

The pkg_info command is
used to dump out information for packages, either packed up
in files with the pkg_create(1) command or already installed
on the system with the pkg_add(1) command.

OPTIONS

The following command line
options are supported:

pkg-name ...

The named packages are
described. A package name may either be the name of an
installed package, the pathname to a package distribution
file or a URL to an FTP available package. Package version
numbers can also be matched in a relational manner using the
&ge;, &le;, > and  operators. For
example, pkg_info
&rsquo;portupgrade&ge;20030723&rsquo; will match
versions 20030723 and later of the portupgrade
package.

&minus;a

Show all
currently installed packages.

&minus;b

Use the
BLOCKSIZE environment variable for output even when the
&minus;q or &minus;Q flag is present.

&minus;v

Turn on verbose
output.

&minus;p

Show the
installation prefix for each package.

&minus;q

Be
&rsquo;&rsquo;quiet&rsquo;&rsquo; in emitting report headers
and such, just dump the raw info (basically, assume a
non-human reading).

&minus;Q

Be
&rsquo;&rsquo;quiet&rsquo;&rsquo; as above but print preface
output with the package name.

&minus;c

Show the (one
line) comment field for each package.

&minus;d

Show the long
description field for each package.

&minus;D

Show the
install-message file for each package.

&minus;f

Show the
packing list instructions for each package.

&minus;g

Show files that
don&rsquo;t match the recorded checksum.

&minus;i

Show the
install script (if any) for each package.

&minus;I

Show an index
line for each package. This option takes precedence over all
other package formatting options.

&minus;j

Show the
requirements script (if any) for each package.

&minus;k

Show the
de-install script (if any) for each package.

&minus;r

Show the list
of packages on which each package depends.

&minus;R

Show the list
of installed packages which require each package.

&minus;m

Show the mtree
file (if any) for each package.

&minus;L

Show the files
within each package. This is different from just viewing the
packing list, since full pathnames for everything are
generated.

&minus;s

Show the total
size occupied by files installed within each package.

&minus;o

Show the
&rsquo;&rsquo;origin&rsquo;&rsquo; path recorded on package
generation. This path intended to give an idea as to where
the underlying port, from which package was generated, is
located in the FreeBSD Ports Collection.

&minus;G

Do not try to
expand shell glob patterns in the pkg-name when
selecting packages to be displayed (by default
pkg_info automatically expands shell glob patterns in
the pkg-name).

&minus;W

For the
specified filename argument show which package it
belongs to. If the file is not in the current directory, and
does not have an absolute path, then the PATH is searched
using which(1).

&minus;O

For the
specified origin argument list all packages having
this origin.

&minus;x

Treat the
pkg-name as a regular expression and display
information only for packages whose names match that regular
expression. Multiple regular expressions could be provided,
in that case pkg_info displays information about all
packages that match at least one regular expression from the
list.

&minus;X

Like
&minus;x, but treats the pkg-name as an
extended regular expression.

&minus;e
pkg-name

If the package identified by
pkg-name is currently installed, return 0, otherwise
return 1. This option allows you to easily test for the
presence of another (perhaps prerequisite) package from a
script.

&minus;E

Show only
matching package names. This option takes precedence over
all other package formatting options. If any packages match,
return 0, otherwise return 1.

&minus;l str

Prefix each
information category header (see &minus;q) shown with
str. This is primarily of use to front-end programs
who want to request a lot of different information fields at
once for a package, but don&rsquo;t necessary want the
output intermingled in such a way that they can&rsquo;t
organize it. This lets you add a special token to the start
of each field.

&minus;t
template

Use template as the
input to mktemp(3) when creating a &rsquo;&rsquo;staging
area&rsquo;&rsquo;. By default, this is the string
/tmp/instmp.XXXXXX, but it may be necessary to
override it in the situation where space in your /tmp
directory is limited. Be sure to leave some number of
&rsquo;X&rsquo; characters for mktemp(3) to fill in with a
unique ID.

Note: This should really not be
necessary with pkg_info, since very little
information is extracted from each package and one would
have to have a very small /tmp indeed to overflow
it.

&minus;V

Show revision
number of the packing list format.

&minus;P

Show revision
number of package tools.

TECHNICAL DETAILS

Package info is either extracted
from package files named on the command line, or from
already installed package information in
/var/db/pkg/&lang; pkg-name&rang; .

ENVIRONMENT 
BLOCKSIZE

If the
environment variable BLOCKSIZE is set the block counts will
be displayed in units of that size block.

PKG_TMPDIR

Points to the
directory where pkg_info creates its temporary files.
If this variable is not set, TMPDIR is used. If both are
unset, the builtin defaults are used.

PKG_DBDIR

Specifies an
alternative location for the installed package database.

FILES 
/var/tmp

Used if the
environment variables PKG_TMPDIR and TMPDIR are not set, or
if the directories named have insufficient space.

/tmp

The next choice
if /var/tmp does not exist or has insufficient
space.

/usr/tmp

The last choice
if /tmp is unsuitable.

/var/db/pkg

Default
location of the installed package database.
