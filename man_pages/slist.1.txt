NAME

slist &minus;
Lists available NetWare Servers

SYNOPSIS

slist [
pattern ]

DESCRIPTION

slist
lists all NetWare Servers available in your network.

If slist does
not print to a tty, the decorative header line is not
printed, so that you can count the servers on your network
by doing

slist | wc
-l

OPTIONS

pattern

pattern is used to list
only servers whose names match the specified pattern. For a
server to be listed, the pattern must match the full server
name. You can use wildcards for the pattern, but you must
protect these wildcards from any command line expansion by
quoting. Case doesn&rsquo;t matter.

EXAMPLE

slist
"I*"

or

slist "i*"

List all available Netware
servers on your Network, that begin with an
"I".

BUGS

works only in IPX environment, as it uses SAP

servers.
