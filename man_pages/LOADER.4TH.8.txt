LOADER.4TH(8) BSD System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
LOADER.4TH(8)

NAME

loader.4th &mdash;
loader.conf processing tools

DESCRIPTION

The file that goes by the name
of loader.4th is a set of commands designed to
manipulate loader.conf(5) files. The default
/boot/loader.rc includes loader.4th and uses
one of its commands to automatically read and process the
standard loader.conf(5) files. Other commands exists to help
the user specify alternate configurations.

The commands of
loader.4th by themselves are not enough for most
uses. Please refer to the examples below for the most common
situations, and to loader(8) for additional commands.

Before using any
of the commands provided in loader.4th, it must be
included through the command:

include
loader.4th

This line is
present in the default /boot/loader.rc file, so it
isn&rsquo;t needed (and should not be re-issued) in a normal
setup.

The commands
provided by it are:

boot 
boot kernelname [...] 
boot directory [...] 
boot &minus;flag ...

Boot as
specified by the loader.conf(5) files read.

Depending on
the arguments passed, it can override boot flags and either
the kernel name or the search path for kernel and
modules.

boot-conf 
boot-conf kernelname [...] 
boot-conf directory [...] 
boot-conf &minus;flag ...

Works like
boot described above, but instead of booting
immediately, uses autoboot, so it can be stopped.

start

Reads
/boot/defaults/loader.conf, all other loader.conf(5)
files specified in it, and then proceeds to boot as
specified in them. This is the command used in the default
/boot/loader.rc file, and it uses the autoboot
command (see loader(8)), so it can be stopped for further
interaction with loader(8).

initialize

Initialize the
supporting library so commands can be used without executing
start first. Like start, reads
/boot/defaults/loader.conf and all other
loader.conf(5) files specified in it. Returns a flag on the
stack to indicate if any configuration file was successfully
loaded.

read-conf
filename

Reads and
processes a loader.conf(5) file. Does not proceed to
boot.

enable-module
module

Enables the
loading of module.

disable-module
module

Disables the
loading of module.

toggle-module
module

Toggles the
loading of module on and off.

show-module
module

Shows the
information gathered in the loader.conf(5) files about the
module module.

retry

Used inside
loader.conf(5) files to specify the action after a module
loading fails.

ignore

Used inside
loader.conf(5) files to specify the action after a module
loading fails.

FILES 
/boot/loader

The
loader(8).

/boot/loader.4th

loader.4th
itself.

/boot/loader.rc

loader(8)
bootstrapping script.

/boot/defaults/loader.conf

File loaded by the start
command.

EXAMPLES

Standard
/boot/loader.rc:

include
/boot/loader.4th 
start

Load a different
kernel with the standard configuration:

set
kernel="/boot/kernel.old/kernel" 
unload 
boot-conf

Read an
additional configuration file and then proceed to boot:

unload 
read-conf /boot/special.conf 
boot-conf

Disable the
loading of the splash screen module and bitmap and then
proceed to boot:

unload 
disable-module splash_bmp 
disable-module bitmap 
boot-conf
