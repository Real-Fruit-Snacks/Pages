NAME

pmlogsummary
- calculate averages of metrics stored in a set of PCP
archives

SYNOPSIS

pmlogsummary
[-abfFHiIlmMNsvVxyz?] [-B nbins]
[-n pmnsfile] [-p precision]
[-S starttime] [-T endtime]
[-Z timezone] archive
[metricname ...]

DESCRIPTION

pmlogsummary
prints statistical information about metrics of numeric type
contained within the files of a set of Performance Co-Pilot
(PCP) archives. The default output prints time averages for
both counter and non-counter metrics. The set of archives is
identified by archive, which is a comma-separated
list of names, each of which may be the base name of an
archive or the name of a directory containing one or more
archives. The archives are typically created using
pmlogger(1).

The metrics of
interest are named in the metricname arguments. If
metricname is a non-leaf node in the Performance
Metrics Name Space (PMNS(5)), then
pmlogsummary will recursively descend the PMNS and
report on all leaf nodes. If no metricname argument
is given, the root of the namespace is used.

Metrics with
counter semantics are converted to rates before being
evaluated.

OPTIONS

The available
command line options are: 
-a, --all

Print all information. This is
equivalent to -blmMy.

-b

Print both forms of averaging, that is both stochastic
and time averaging.

-B nbins,
--bins=nbins

Print the approximate
distribution of values, using histogram bins such that the
value range (minimum - maximum) for each metric is divided
equally into nbins bins, and each bin accumulates the
frequency of observed values in the corresponding range.
Refer to the &rsquo;&rsquo;OUTPUT FORMAT&rsquo;&rsquo;
section below for a description of how the distribution of
values is reported).

-f

Spreadsheet format - the tab character is used to
delimit each field printed. This option is intended to allow
pmlogsummary output to be imported directly into
common spreadsheet applications.

-F

Spreadsheet format - the comma character is used to
delimit each field printed. This option is intended to allow
pmlogsummary output to be imported directly into
common spreadsheet applications which support the Comma
Separated Value (.csv) format.

-H, --header

Print a one-line header at the
start showing what each field represents.

-i, --mintime

Also print the time at which
the minimum value was logged. The format of this timestamp
is described in the &rsquo;&rsquo;OUTPUT
FORMAT&rsquo;&rsquo; section below.

-I, --maxtime

Also print the time at which
the maximum value was logged. The format of this timestamp
is described in the &rsquo;&rsquo;OUTPUT
FORMAT&rsquo;&rsquo; section below.

-l, --label

Also print the archive label,
showing the archive format version, the time and date for
the start and end of the archive time window, and the host
from which the performance metrics values were
collected.

-m, --minimum

Also print the minimum logged
value for each metric.

-M, --maximum

Also print the maximum logged
value for each metric.

-n pmnsfile,
--namespace=pmnsfile

Load an alternative Performance
Metrics Name Space (PMNS(5)) from the file
pmnsfile.

-N

Suppress any warnings resulting from individual archive
fetches (default).

-p precision,
--precision=precision

Print all floating point
numbers with precision digits after the decimal
place.

-s, --sum

Print (only) the sum of all
logged values for each metric.

-S starttime,
--start=starttime

Set the starttime of the
time window. Refer to PCPIntro(1) for a complete
description of the syntax for starttime.

-T endtime,
--finish=endtime

Set the endtime of the
time window. Refer to PCPIntro(1) for a complete
description of the syntax for endtime.

-v, --verbose

Report (verbosely) on warnings
resulting from individual archive fetches.

-V, --version

Display version number and
exit.

-x

Print stochastic averages instead of the default (time
averages). 

-y, --samples

Also print the number of
samples encountered in the set of archives for each
metric.

-z,
--hostzone

Change the timezone to the
local timezone at the host that is the source of the
performance metrics, as specified in the label record of the
archive.

-Z timezone,
--timezone=timezone

By default, pmlogsummary
reports the time of day according to the local timezone on
the system where pmlogsummary is run. Change the
timezone to timezone in the format of the environment
variable TZ as described in environ(7).

-?, --help

Display usage message and
exit.

OUTPUT FORMAT

The
pmlogsummary output format is spartan as it is
intended to be post-processed with standard tools. This
means that there is no annotation associated with each
output field which would make processing harder. The
intention is that pmlogsummary output be massaged
into a format which can be used by a spreadsheet program, is
suitable for inclusion in a web page, or whatever.

For each
metric, pmlogsummary produces a single output line as
follows:

metricname
value(s) units

For metrics
with multiple instances, pmlogsummary produces
multiple lines of output as follows:

metricname
["instance 1"] value(s) units 
metricname ["instance 2"] value(s)
units 
metricname ["instance N"] value(s)
units

The printed
value(s) for each metric always follow this order:
stochastic average, time average, minimum, minimum
timestamp, maximum, maximum timestamp, count, [bin 1 range],
bin 1 count, ... [bin nbins range], bin nbins
count. The individual values for each metric are
space-separated (unless the -f option is used).

All counter
metrics which are measured in units of time will be
converted to seconds before being rate converted and used in
the pmlogsummary calculations. The values calculated
for these metrics are also printed in seconds.

The units will
be displayed in the format described by
pmUnitsStr(3).

Given either of
the -i or -I options, pmlogsummary
produces two different timestamp formats, depending on the
interval over which it is run. For an interval greater than
24 hours, the date is displayed in addition to the time at
which the maxima and/or minima occurred. If the extent of
the data being checked is less than 24 hours, a more precise
format is used (time is displayed with millisecond
precision, but without the date).

NOTES

The average for
an individual metric is calculated as follows:

Non-counter
metrics are averaged using stochastic averaging - each
observation has an equal weighting towards the calculation
of the average (the sum of all values divided by the total
number of values, for each metric).

Counter metrics
are averaged using time averaging (by default), but the
-x option can be used to specify that counters be
averaged using the stochastic method instead. When
calculating a time average, the sum of the product of each
sample value multiplied by the time difference between each
sample, is divided by the total time over which that metric
was logged.

Counter metrics
whose measurements do not span 90% of the set of archives
will be printed with the metric name prefixed by an asterisk
(*).

FILES

$PCP_VAR_DIR/pmns/*

files

$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmlogger/

Default directory for PCP
archives containing performance metric values collected from
the host .

PCP ENVIRONMENT

Environment
variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On
each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains
the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).
