NAME

nnrpd.track -
Specify hosts to be tracked by nnrpd

DESCRIPTION

This file,
which is located in pathetc, specifies which hosts
are to have their activities recorded during an nnrpd
session. The nnrpd server reads it when first spawned
by innd, provided readertrack in
inn.conf is true; otherwise this file is not
used.

Entries consist
of one host specification per line, each line having two
fields, separated by a colon:

host:identity

The first field
is either one of the FQDNs of a host, or a domain name (in
the form "*.domain.com").

The second
field is simply a segment of text which may be used to more
easily identify the client, typically an e-mail address or
other identifying mark. Each post of tracked hosts will have
an entry associated with identity in the log message
recorded to the pathlog/tracklogs directory, and
every posted article will be saved in the
pathlog/trackposts directory.

An example of
nnrpd.track file is:

nasty.foo.com:nasty [AT] foo.com

*.bar.com:VeryNastyClient
