NAME

g32pbm -
convert a Group 3 fax file into a portable bitmap

SYNOPSIS

g32pbm
[-reversebits] [-stretch] [g3file]

DESCRIPTION

Reads a Group 3
fax file (raw or digifax) as input. If no filename is given,
stdin is used. Produces a portable bitmap as output.

OPTIONS

-r

Tells g32pbm to interpret
bits least-significant first, instead of the default
most-significant first ("-reversebits"). Some fax
modems do it one way and others do it the other way. If you
get a whole bunch of "invalid code" messages
(nearly one per line), try using this flag.

-s

Double each horizontal row of the fax file in the pbm
file ("-stretch)". You can use this to adjust the
aspect ratio of a "normal resolution" fax file to
match that of a "fine resolution" fax file. This
might not seem like it belongs here, but it&rsquo;s
much faster than using pnmscale|pgmtopbm later.
-s is activated automatically if the file is
specified on the command line and its name starts with
"fn..." (fax/normal).

-l(aserjet)

Instead of a portable bitmap
(PBM), output HP laserjet files, suitable for direct
printing on a HP laserjet or desjket.

-d 

Scale output to 
dots per inch before printing. Normal FAX resolution is
204x196 dpi (fine mode), or 204x98 dpi (normal mode). In
LaerJet mode, only the values 75, 150 and 300 are allowed
for .

-t

turn image by 90 degrees clockwise. Multiple -t commands
increase angle, that is, -t -t will turn it upside down, and
so on.

-?

Print a short command syntax.

REFERENCES

The standard
for Group 3 fax is defined in CCITT Recommendation T.4.

BUGS

g32pbm
could be smarter about the image width, at the moment, the
maximum width is 1728 pixels, and the maximum height is 4300
lines. Everything bigger is just cut off.

Only
&rsquo;raw&rsquo; pbm files are created.

Scaling is too
slow.

Turning is too
slow (and not yet fully implemented either).
