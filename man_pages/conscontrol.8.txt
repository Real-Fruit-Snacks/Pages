NAME

conscontrol &mdash;
control physical console devices

SYNOPSIS

conscontrol
[list] 
conscontrol mute on | off 
conscontrol add | delete console

DESCRIPTION

The conscontrol utility
is used to examine and modify the physical devices which
back the virtual console devices. If no arguments (or only
the list command) are specified, the current console
settings are shown.

There are two
types of logical consoles; a high level console which is
represented by /dev/console, and a low level console.
The low level console is used for kernel printf(9) and
ddb(4) debugger support, while the high level console is
used by user programs like syslogd(8). Multiple device
support is implemented only for the low level console; the
high level console is set to the first device in the console
list.

Multiple console
support may be invoked by passing the kernel the
&minus;D flag from the boot loader, or by using
conscontrol to change the list of console devices
after the system has booted.

The following
options are available:

add | delete
console

Add or delete a physical device
from the logical console. The device must support low-level
console operations. Adding a device will place it at the
front of the list of console devices; the first device is
used for the high level console.

The
console argument is the name of a console device in
/dev; the name of the directory may be omitted.

mute on | off

Change the state of console
muting. All console output is suppressed when console muting
is on.

set console |
unset

Set or unset the virtual
console. When unset, output from the system, such as the
kernel printf(9), always goes out to the real main console.
When set, it goes to another. This is an interface to the
tty ioctl TIOCCONS.

The conscontrol utility
