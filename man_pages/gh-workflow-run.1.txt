NAME
       gh-workflow-run - Run a workflow by creating a workflow_dispatch event

SYNOPSIS
       gh workflow run [<workflow-id> | <workflow-name>] [flags]

DESCRIPTION
       Create a workflow_dispatch event for a given workflow.

       This  command will trigger GitHub Actions to run a given workflow file.
       The given workflow file must support a workflow_dispatch  'on'  trigger
       in order to be run in this way.

       If  the  workflow  file supports inputs, they can be specified in a few
       ways:

              • Interactively

              • via -f or -F flags

              • As JSON, via STDIN

OPTIONS
       -F, --field <key=value>
              Add a string parameter in key=value format, respecting @ syntax

       --json Read workflow inputs as JSON via STDIN

       -f, --raw-field <key=value>
              Add a string parameter in key=value format

       -r, --ref <string>
              The branch or tag name which contains the version of  the  work‐
              flow file you'd like to run

OPTIONS INHERITED FROM PARENT COMMANDS
       -R, --repo <[HOST/]OWNER/REPO>
              Select another repository using the [HOST/]OWNER/REPO format

EXAMPLE
              # Have gh prompt you for what workflow you'd like to run and interactively collect inputs
              $ gh workflow run

              # Run the workflow file 'triage.yml' at the remote's default branch
              $ gh workflow run triage.yml

              # Run the workflow file 'triage.yml' at a specified ref
              $ gh workflow run triage.yml --ref my-branch

              # Run the workflow file 'triage.yml' with command line inputs
              $ gh workflow run triage.yml -f name=scully -f greeting=hello

              # Run the workflow file 'triage.yml' with JSON via standard input
              $ echo '{"name":"scully", "greeting":"hello"}' | gh workflow run triage.yml --json
