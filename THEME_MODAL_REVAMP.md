## Technical Implementation

### Enhanced Theme Metadata
Each theme now includes:

    class: 'theme-class',
    icon: 'ðŸŽ¨',
    file: 'themes/theme.css',
    description: 'Brief description of the theme',
    categories: ['dark', 'vibrant'],
    colors: {
        bg: '#background',
        fg: '#foreground', 
        accent: '#accent'
    }
}
```

### Live Preview Generation
- Dynamic terminal preview using theme colors
- `adjustBrightness()` helper for color variations
- Realistic man page formatting
- Responsive to theme color schemes

### Filtering System

## User Experience Improvements

2. **Easy Discovery**: Search and filters help find themes quickly
3. **Better Organization**: Categories group similar themes
4. **Informed Choice**: Descriptions explain each theme's aesthetic
5. **Smooth Transitions**: All interactions are animated and responsive
