NAME
       Image::ExifTool::CanonCustom - Read and Write Canon custom functions

SYNOPSIS
       This module is loaded automatically by Image::ExifTool when required.

DESCRIPTION
       The Canon custom functions meta information is very specific to the
       camera model, and is found in both the EXIF maker notes and in the
       Canon RAW files.  This module contains the definitions necessary for
       Image::ExifTool to read this information.
