INFINITY(3)                Library Functions Manual                INFINITY(3)

NAME
       INFINITY,  NAN,  HUGE_VAL,  HUGE_VALF,  HUGE_VALL - floating-point con-
       stants

LIBRARY
       Math library (libm)

SYNOPSIS
       #define _ISOC99_SOURCE      /* See feature_test_macros(7) */
       #include <math.h>

       INFINITY

       NAN

       HUGE_VAL
       HUGE_VALF
       HUGE_VALL

DESCRIPTION
       The macro INFINITY expands to a float  constant  representing  positive
       infinity.

       The  macro  NAN  expands  to  a float constant representing a quiet NaN
       (when supported).  A quiet NaN is a NaN ("not-a-number") that does  not
       raise exceptions when it is used in arithmetic.  The opposite is a sig-
       naling NaN.  See IEC 60559:1989.

       The macros HUGE_VAL, HUGE_VALF, HUGE_VALL expand to constants of  types
       double,  float,  and  long double, respectively, that represent a large
       positive value, possibly positive infinity.

STANDARDS
       C99.

       On a glibc system, the macro HUGE_VAL is always available.   Availabil-
       ity  of the NAN macro can be tested using #ifdef NAN, and similarly for
       INFINITY, HUGE_VALF, HUGE_VALL.  They will be defined  by  <math.h>  if
       _ISOC99_SOURCE  or  _GNU_SOURCE  is defined, or __STDC_VERSION__ is de-
       fined and has a value not less than 199901L.
