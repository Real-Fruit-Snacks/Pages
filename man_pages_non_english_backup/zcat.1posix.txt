ZCAT(1POSIX)               POSIX Programmer's Manual              ZCAT(1POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       zcat — expand and concatenate data

SYNOPSIS
       zcat [file...]

DESCRIPTION
       The zcat utility shall write to standard output the  uncompressed  form
       of  files  that  have been compressed using the compress utility. It is
       the equivalent of uncompress -c.  Input files are not affected.

OPTIONS
       None.

OPERANDS
       The following operand shall be supported:

       file      The pathname of a file previously processed by  the  compress
                 utility.  If  file already has the .Z suffix specified, it is
                 used as submitted. Otherwise, the .Z suffix  is  appended  to
                 the filename prior to processing.

STDIN
       The  standard  input  shall be used only if no file operands are speci‐
       fied, or if a file operand is '-'.

INPUT FILES
       Input files shall be compressed files that are in the  format  produced
       by the compress utility.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of zcat:

       LANG      Provide  a  default  value for the internationalization vari‐
                 ables that are unset or null. (See the Base Definitions  vol‐
                 ume  of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 8.2, Internationalization Vari‐
                 ables for the precedence  of  internationalization  variables
                 used to determine the values of locale categories.)

       LC_ALL    If  set  to  a non-empty string value, override the values of
                 all the other internationalization variables.

       LC_CTYPE  Determine the locale for the interpretation of  sequences  of
                 bytes of text data as characters (for example, single-byte as
                 opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments).

       LC_MESSAGES
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format
                 and  contents  of diagnostic messages written to standard er‐
                 ror.

       NLSPATH   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing
                 of LC_MESSAGES.

ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
       Default.

STDOUT
       The compressed files given as input shall be written on standard output
       in their uncompressed form.

STDERR
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

OUTPUT FILES
       None.

EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
       None.

EXIT STATUS
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Successful completion.

       >0    An error occurred.

CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
       Default.

       None.

EXAMPLES
       None.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
