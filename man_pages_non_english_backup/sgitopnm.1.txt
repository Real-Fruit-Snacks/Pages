NAME
       sgitopnm - convert a SGI image file to PNM

SYNOPSIS
       sgitopnm

       [-verbose]

       [-channel c]

       [SgiFileName]

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       sgitopnm  reads an SGI image file as input and produces a PGM image for
       a 2-dimensional (1- or 2-channel) input file, and a  PPM  image  for  a
       3-dimensional (3 or more channels) input file.

       Alternatively, the program produces a PGM image of any one of the chan‐
       nels in the input file.

       Before Netpbm 10.67 (June 2014), sgitopnm does not  work  on  2-channel
       SGI images.  It fails if you try.

       If  you  don't specify the SgiFileName argument, input is from Standard
       Input.

       Before Netpbm 10.67 (June 2014), sgitopnm requires its input  to  be  a
       seekable file, so for example you can't feed it from a pipe.

OPTIONS
       In  addition  to  the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm
       (most notably -quiet, see
        Common Options ⟨index.html#commonoptions⟩ ), sgitopnm  recognizes  the
       following command line options:

       -verbose
              Give some information about the SGI image file.

       -channel n
              Extract channel n of the image as a PGM image.

              Without this option, sgitopnm extracts the first 3 channels as a
              PPM image or, if the input has 1 or  2  channels,  extracts  the
              first channel as a PGM image.

              A 2-channel image is grayscale plus transparency, so you can get
              the transparency information with -channel=2.   You  could  then
              combine them into a PAM image of tuple type GRAYSCALE_ALPHA with
              pamstack.
