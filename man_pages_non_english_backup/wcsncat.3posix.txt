WCSNCAT(3POSIX)            POSIX Programmer's Manual           WCSNCAT(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       wcsncat — concatenate a wide-character string with part of another

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       wchar_t *wcsncat(wchar_t *restrict ws1, const wchar_t *restrict ws2,
           size_t n);

DESCRIPTION
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with  the
       ISO C  standard.  Any  conflict between the requirements described here
       and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017
       defers to the ISO C standard.

       The  wcsncat()  function  shall  append  not more than n wide-character
       codes (a null wide-character code and wide-character codes that  follow
       it are not appended) from the array pointed to by ws2 to the end of the
       wide-character string pointed to by ws1.   The  initial  wide-character
       code  of ws2 shall overwrite the null wide-character code at the end of
       ws1.  A terminating null wide-character code shall always  be  appended
       to the result. If copying takes place between objects that overlap, the
       behavior is undefined.

RETURN VALUE
       The wcsncat() function shall return ws1; no return value is reserved to
       indicate an error.

ERRORS
       No errors are defined.
