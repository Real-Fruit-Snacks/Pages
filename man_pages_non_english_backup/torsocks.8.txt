TORSOCKS(8)                                                        TORSOCKS(8)

NAME
       torsocks  —  Library  for intercepting outgoing network connections and
       redirecting them through the Tor SOCKS proxy.

DESCRIPTION
       Torsocks library overloads the libc symbols use for Internet communica‐
       tion  such as connect(2) system call. Using that technique, the library
       sends everything through the Tor network including DNS resolution  done
       by the application.

       For  DNS,  gethostbyname(3)  family functions are rerouted through Tor.
       Please note that the ISC res_* API is currently not supported.

       Here is an example on how to use torsocks library with ssh(1):

       $  LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/libtorsocks.so  ssh  -l   kalexander   -p   1234
       prism.nsa.gov [...]

SHELL USAGE
       Set LD_PRELOAD to load the library then use applications as normal. The
       syntax to force preload of the library for different shells  is  speci‐
       fied below:

       Bash, Ksh and Bourne shell:

       $ export LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/libtorsocks.so

       C Shell:

       $ setenv LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/libtorsocks.so

       This  process  can be automated (for Bash, Bourne and Korn shell users)
       for a single command or for all commands in a shell  session  by  using
       the torsocks(1) script.

       You  can  also setup torsocks(1) in such a way that all processes auto‐
       matically use it, a very useful configuration. Please refer to the tor‐
       socks script documentation for more information.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       TORSOCKS_CONF_FILE
              This  environment variable overrides the default location of the
              torsocks configuration file. This variable is not honored if the
              program torsocks is embedded in is setuid.

       TORSOCKS_LOG_LEVEL
              Enable  logging  level of torsocks library. By default, warnings
              and errors are printed (level 3). Note that each level  includes
              the lower ones except the 1 which disables any possible logging.
              (default: 3)

              1   No log at all.
              2   Error messages.
              3   Warning messages.
              4   Notice messages.
              5   Debug messages.

       TORSOCKS_LOG_TIME
              Control whether or not the time is added to each  logging  line.
              (default: 1)

       TORSOCKS_LOG_FILE_PATH
              If set, torsocks will log in the file set by this variable. (de‐
              fault: stderr)

       TORSOCKS_USERNAME
              Set the username for the SOCKS5 authentication method.  Password
              MUST be set also with the variable below.

       TORSOCKS_PASSWORD
              Set  the password for the SOCKS5 authentication method. Username
              MUST be set also with the variable above.

       TORSOCKS_TOR_ADDRESS
              Set the Tor address. (default: 127.0.0.1)

       TORSOCKS_TOR_PORT
              Set the Tor port. (default: 9050)

       TORSOCKS_ALLOW_INBOUND
              Allow inbound connections so the application can accept and lis‐
              ten for connections.

       TORSOCKS_ISOLATE_PID
              Set  the  username  and  password  for the SOCKS5 authentication
              method to a PID/current time based value automatically. Username
              and Password MUST NOT be set.

KNOWN ISSUES
   DNS
       Torsocks  is  not able to send DNS queries through Tor since UDP is not
       supported. Thus, any UDP socket is denied. However,  DNS  queries  that
       can be intercept are sent to Tor and sent back to the caller.

   ERRORS
       Torsocks  might  generate  error messages and print them to stderr when
       there are problems with the configuration file or the SOCKS negotiation
       with  the  Tor daemon. The TORSOCKS_LOG_LEVEL environment variable con‐
       trols that behavior as well as the log file option. Keep in  mind  that
       this library can output on the stderr of the application.

LIMITATIONS
       Outgoing TCP connections can only be proxified through the Tor network.

       Torsocks  forces  the  libc resolver to use TCP for name queries, if it
       does this it does it regardless of whether or not the DNS to be queried
       is local or not.  This introduces overhead and should only be used when
       needed.

       Torsocks uses ELF dynamic loader features to intercept dynamic function
       calls  from programs in which it is embedded. As a result, non-ELF exe‐
       cutables, or executables that make system calls directly with the  sys‐
       tem call trap (int 0x80) are not supported.
