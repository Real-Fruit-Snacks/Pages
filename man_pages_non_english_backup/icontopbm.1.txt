NAME
       icontopbm - replaced by sunicontopnm

SYNOPSIS
       icontopbm [iconfile]

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       icontopbm  was  obsoleted  by  sunicontopnm(1),  introduced with Netpbm
       10.53 (December 2010).  sunicontopnm is backward compatible with  icon-
       topbm, plus adds additional functions, including the ability to convert
       a Depth=8 Sun icon, producing a PGM image.

       Starting in Release 10.53, icontopbm is just an alias for sunicontopnm.

       The point of the name change is that there are many kinds of  icons  in
       the  world  besides  Sun icons, and in 2010, the Sun variety isn't even
       common.

       In releases before 10.53, you can use  the  sunicontopnm  documentation
       for  icontopbm,  as  long as you recognize that any change the sunicon-
       topnm manual says happened in or after Netpbm 10.53  doesn't  apply  to
       icontopbm.
