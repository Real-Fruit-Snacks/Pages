SETEUID(3POSIX)            POSIX Programmer's Manual           SETEUID(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       seteuid — set effective user ID

SYNOPSIS
       #include <unistd.h>

       int seteuid(uid_t uid);

DESCRIPTION
       If uid is equal to the real user ID or the saved set-user-ID, or if the
       process  has  appropriate privileges, seteuid() shall set the effective
       user ID of the calling process to uid; the real user ID and saved  set-
       user-ID shall remain unchanged.

       The seteuid() function shall not affect the supplementary group list in
       any way.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, 0 shall be returned; otherwise, -1 shall be
       returned and errno set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The seteuid() function shall fail if:

       EINVAL The value of the uid argument is invalid and is not supported by
              the implementation.

       EPERM  The process does not have appropriate privileges  and  uid  does
              not match the real user ID or the saved set-user-ID.
