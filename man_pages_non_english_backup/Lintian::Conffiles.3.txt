Lintian::Conffiles(3)       Debian Package Checker       Lintian::Conffiles(3)

NAME
       Lintian::Conffiles - access to collected control data for conffiles

SYNOPSIS
           use Lintian::Processable;

DESCRIPTION
       Lintian::Conffiles provides an interface to control data for conffiles.

INSTANCE METHODS
       by_file
       parse
       all Returns a list of absolute filenames found for conffiles.

       is_known (FILE)
           Returns a truth value if FILE is listed in the conffiles control
           file.  If the control file is not present or FILE is not listed in
           it, it returns "undef".

           Note that FILE should be the filename relative to the package root
           (even though the control file uses absolute paths).  If the control
           file does relative paths, they are assumed to be relative to the
           package root as well (and used without warning).
