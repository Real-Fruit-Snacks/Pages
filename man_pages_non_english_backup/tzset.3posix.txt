TZSET(3POSIX)              POSIX Programmer's Manual             TZSET(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       daylight, timezone, tzname, tzset — set timezone conversion information

SYNOPSIS
       #include <time.h>

       extern int daylight;
       extern long timezone;
       extern char *tzname[2];
       void tzset(void);

DESCRIPTION
       The tzset() function shall use the value of the environment variable TZ
       to  set  time  conversion information used by ctime(), localtime(), mk‐
       time(), and strftime().  If TZ is absent from the  environment,  imple‐
       mentation-defined default timezone information shall be used.

       The tzset() function shall set the external variable tzname as follows:

           tzname[0] = "std";
           tzname[1] = "dst";

       where  std  and  dst are as described in the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, Chapter 8, Environment Variables.

       The tzset() function also shall set the external variable daylight to 0
       if  Daylight  Savings  Time conversions should never be applied for the
       timezone in use; otherwise, non-zero. The  external  variable  timezone
       shall be set to the difference, in seconds, between Coordinated Univer‐
       sal Time (UTC) and local standard time.

       If a thread accesses tzname, daylight, or timezone directly  while  an‐
       other  thread  is  in a call to tzset(), or to any function that is re‐
       quired or allowed to set timezone information as if by calling tzset(),
       the behavior is undefined.

RETURN VALUE
       The tzset() function shall not return a value.

ERRORS
       No errors are defined.

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       Example  TZ  variables  and their timezone differences are given in the
       table below:

                              ┌───────────┬────────────┐
                              │    TZ     │  timezone  │
                              ├───────────┼────────────┤
                              │EST5EDT    │ 5*60*60    │
                              │GMT0       │ 0*60*60    │
                              │JST-9      │ -9*60*60   │
                              │MET-1MEST  │ -1*60*60   │
                              │MST7MDT    │ 7*60*60    │
                              │PST8PDT    │ 8*60*60    │
                              └───────────┴────────────┘
APPLICATION USAGE
       Since the ctime(), localtime(), mktime(), strftime(), and  strftime_l()
       functions  are  required  to  set timezone information as if by calling
       tzset(), there is no need for an explicit  tzset()  call  before  using
       these functions. However, portable applications should call tzset() ex‐
       plicitly before using ctime_r() or localtime_r() because setting  time‐
       zone information is optional for those functions.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
