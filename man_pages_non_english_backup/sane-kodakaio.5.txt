NAME
       sane-kodakaio - SANE backend for Kodak aio printer / scanners

DESCRIPTION
       The  sane-kodakaio  library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy)
       backend which provides access to Kodak aio printer/scanners,  like  the
       ESP and Hero series.

       This  document describes backend version 2.4, which is the first candi‐
       date for incorporation in sane-backends.

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
       This version should support models of the Kodak ESP  and  Hero  series,
       and  possibly  some Advent AiO scanners. The ESP 5250 and Hero 9.1 were
       used to develop the backend, but other models may work. Please see  the
       supported   devices   list   at  http://www.sane-project.org/sane-back‐
       ends.html#S-KODAKAIO.

       If you have a model not on that list, or reported  as  'untested':  the
       best way to determine level of support is to test the scanner directly.

CONFIGURATION FILE
       The configuration file kodakaio.conf is used to tell the backend how to
       look for scanners, and provide options controlling the operation of the
       backend.  This file is read each time the frontend asks the backend for
       a list of scanners, generally only when the frontend starts.

ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_DEBUG_KODAKAIO
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this en‐
              vironment  variable  controls  the debug level for this backend.
              Higher debug levels increase the verbosity of the output.

KNOWN ISSUES
       Most hardware options are either not supported or not exposed for  con‐
       trol  by  the  user,  including: multifeed detection, image compression
       etc.
