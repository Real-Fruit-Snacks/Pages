PTHREAD_ATTR_GETSTACKSIZE(3POSIX)Programmer'sPTHREAD_ATTR_GETSTACKSIZE(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       pthread_attr_getstacksize, pthread_attr_setstacksize — get and set the
       stacksize attribute

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pthread.h>

       int pthread_attr_getstacksize(const pthread_attr_t *restrict attr,
           size_t *restrict stacksize);
       int pthread_attr_setstacksize(pthread_attr_t *attr, size_t stacksize);

DESCRIPTION
       The  pthread_attr_getstacksize()  and pthread_attr_setstacksize() func‐
       tions, respectively, shall get and set the  thread  creation  stacksize
       attribute in the attr object.

       The  stacksize attribute shall define the minimum stack size (in bytes)
       allocated for the created threads stack.

       The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the  attr  argument
       to  pthread_attr_getstacksize() or pthread_attr_setstacksize() does not
       refer to an initialized thread attributes object.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon    successful    completion,    pthread_attr_getstacksize()    and
       pthread_attr_setstacksize()  shall  return  a value of 0; otherwise, an
       error number shall be returned to indicate the error.

       The pthread_attr_getstacksize() function stores the stacksize attribute
       value in stacksize if successful.

ERRORS
       The pthread_attr_setstacksize() function shall fail if:

       EINVAL The  value  of stacksize is less than {PTHREAD_STACK_MIN} or ex‐
              ceeds a system-imposed limit.

       These functions shall not return an error code of [EINTR].

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       None.

RATIONALE
       If an implementation detects that the value specified by the attr argu‐
       ment to pthread_attr_getstacksize() or pthread_attr_setstacksize() does
       not refer to an initialized thread attributes object, it is recommended
       that the function should fail and report an [EINVAL] error.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
