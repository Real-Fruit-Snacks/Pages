NAME
       wLog - WinPR logging facility

DESCRIPTION
       wLog  is  a  configurable  and  flexible logging system used throughout
       WinPR and FreeRDP.

       The primary concept is to have a hierarchy of loggers that  can  be  be
       configured independently.

Appenders
       WLog  uses  different appenders that define where the log output should
       be written to. If the application doesn't explicitly configure the  ap‐
       penders  the  below  described  variable  WLOG_APPENDER  can be used to
       choose one appender.

       The following kind of appenders are available:

       Binary Write the log data into a binary format file.

       Console
              The console appender writes to the console. Depending of the op‐
              erating system the application runs on, the output might be han‐
              dled differently. For example on  android  log  print  would  be
              used.

       File   The file appender writes the textual output to a file.

       Udp    This appender sends the logging messages to a pre-defined remote
              host via UDP.

              If no target is set the default one 127.0.0.1:20000 is used.  To
              receive  the log messages one can use netcat. To receive the de‐
              fault target the following command can be used: nc -u  127.0.0.1
              -p 20000 -l

       Syslog Use syslog for outputting the debug messages.

       Journald
              This appender outputs messages to journald.

Levels
       The  WLog are complementary, the higher level always includes the lower
       ones.  The level list below is top down. Top the highest level.

       TRACE  print everything including packets dumps

       DEBUG  debug messages

       INFO   general information

       WARN   warnings

       ERROR  errors

       FATAL  fatal problems

       OFF    completely disable the wlog output

Formats
       The format a logger prints has the following possible options:

       lv     log level

       mn     module name

       fl     file name

       fn     function

       ln     line number

       pid    process id

       tid    thread id

       yr     year

       mo     month

       dw     day of week

       hr     hour

       mi     minute

       se     second

       ml     millisecond

       A maximum of 16 options can be used per format string.

       An example that generally sets the WLOG_PREFIX for xfreerdp would  look
       like: WLOG_PREFIX="pid=%pid:tid=%tid:fn=%fn -" xfreerdp /v:xxx

ENVIRONMENT
       WLOG_APPENDER
              The  kind  of  appender, the accepted values are: CONSOLE, FILE,
              BINARY, SYSLOG, JOURNALD or UDP

       WLOG_PREFIX
              configure the prefix used for outputting the message (see Format
              for more details and examples)

       WLOG_LEVEL
              the level to output messages for

       WLOG_FILTER
              sets  a filter for WLog messages. Only the filtered messages are
              printed. The format  of  the  filter  is  a  series  of  <logger
              name>:<level> separated by comas

              example: WLOG_FILTER=core.channel:DEBUG,dummy:TRACE will display
              debug messages for the core.channel logger and trace  level  for
              the dummy logger

       WLOG_FILEAPPENDER_OUTPUT_FILE_PATH
              When  using  the  file  appender  it may contains the output log
              file's path

       WLOG_FILEAPPENDER_OUTPUT_FILE_NAME
              When using the file appender it  may  contains  the  output  log
              file's name

       WLOG_JOURNALD_ID
              When  using the systemd journal appender, this variable contains
              the id used with the journal (by default the executable's name)

       WLOG_UDP_TARGET
              target to use for the UDP appender in the format host:port
