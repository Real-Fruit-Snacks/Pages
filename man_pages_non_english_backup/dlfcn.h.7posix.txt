PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       dlfcn.h -- dynamic linking

SYNOPSIS
       #include <dlfcn.h>

DESCRIPTION
       The <dlfcn.h> header shall define at least the following symbolic  con-
       stants for use in the construction of a dlopen() mode argument:

       RTLD_LAZY     Relocations  are  performed  at an implementation-defined
                     time.

       RTLD_NOW      Relocations are performed when the object is loaded.

       RTLD_GLOBAL   All symbols are available for  relocation  processing  of
                     other modules.

       RTLD_LOCAL    All  symbols  are  not made available for relocation pro-
                     cessing by other modules.

       The following shall be declared as functions and may also be defined as
       macros. Function prototypes shall be provided.

           int    dlclose(void *);
           char  *dlerror(void);
           void  *dlopen(const char *, int);
           void  *dlsym(void *restrict, const char *restrict);

       The following sections are informative.
