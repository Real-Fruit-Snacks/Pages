WCTOB(3POSIX)              POSIX Programmer's Manual             WCTOB(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       wctob — wide-character to single-byte conversion

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdio.h>
       #include <wchar.h>

       int wctob(wint_t c);

DESCRIPTION
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with  the
       ISO C  standard.  Any  conflict between the requirements described here
       and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017
       defers to the ISO C standard.

       The  wctob() function shall determine whether c corresponds to a member
       of the extended character set whose character representation is a  sin‐
       gle byte when in the initial shift state.

       The  behavior  of this function shall be affected by the LC_CTYPE cate‐
       gory of the current locale.

RETURN VALUE
       The wctob() function shall return EOF if c does  not  correspond  to  a
       character  with  length  one  in the initial shift state. Otherwise, it
       shall return the single-byte representation of that character as an un‐
       signed char converted to int.

ERRORS
       No errors are defined.
