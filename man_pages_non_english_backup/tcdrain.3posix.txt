TCDRAIN(3POSIX)            POSIX Programmer's Manual           TCDRAIN(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       tcdrain — wait for transmission of output

SYNOPSIS
       #include <termios.h>

       int tcdrain(int fildes);

DESCRIPTION
       The tcdrain() function shall block until all output written to the  ob‐
       ject  referred  to  by fildes is transmitted. The fildes argument is an
       open file descriptor associated with a terminal.

       Any attempts to use tcdrain() from a process which is  a  member  of  a
       background  process  group  on a fildes associated with its controlling
       terminal, shall cause the process group to be sent  a  SIGTTOU  signal.
       If the calling thread is blocking SIGTTOU signals or the process is ig‐
       noring SIGTTOU signals, the process shall be allowed to perform the op‐
       eration, and no signal is sent.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, 0 shall be returned. Otherwise, -1 shall be
       returned and errno set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The tcdrain() function shall fail if:

       EBADF  The fildes argument is not a valid file descriptor.

       EINTR  A signal interrupted tcdrain().

       EIO    The process group of the writing process is orphaned, the  call‐
              ing  thread  is not blocking SIGTTOU, and the process is not ig‐
              noring SIGTTOU.

       ENOTTY The file associated with fildes is not a terminal.
