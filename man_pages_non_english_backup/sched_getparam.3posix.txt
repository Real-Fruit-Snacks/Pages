SCHED_GETPARAM(3POSIX)     POSIX Programmer's Manual    SCHED_GETPARAM(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       sched_getparam — get scheduling parameters (REALTIME)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sched.h>

       int sched_getparam(pid_t pid, struct sched_param *param);

DESCRIPTION
       The sched_getparam() function shall return the scheduling parameters of
       a  process  specified by pid in the sched_param structure pointed to by
       param.

       If a process specified by pid exists, and if the  calling  process  has
       permission,  the scheduling parameters for the process whose process ID
       is equal to pid shall be returned.

       If pid is zero, the scheduling parameters for the calling process shall
       be  returned. The behavior of the sched_getparam() function is unspeci‐
       fied if the value of pid is negative.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, the sched_getparam() function shall  return
       zero.  If  the  call  to sched_getparam() is unsuccessful, the function
       shall return a value of -1 and set errno to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The sched_getparam() function shall fail if:

       EPERM  The requesting process does not have permission  to  obtain  the
              scheduling parameters of the specified process.

       ESRCH  No process can be found corresponding to that specified by pid.
