WCSNCPY(3POSIX)            POSIX Programmer's Manual           WCSNCPY(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       wcpncpy, wcsncpy — copy a fixed-size wide-character string, returning a
       pointer to its end

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       wchar_t *wcpncpy(wchar_t restrict *ws1, const wchar_t *restrict ws2,
           size_t n);
       wchar_t *wcsncpy(wchar_t *restrict ws1, const wchar_t *restrict ws2,
           size_t n);

DESCRIPTION
       For  wcsncpy():  The  functionality described on this reference page is
       aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the  requirements
       described  here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The wcpncpy() and wcsncpy() functions shall copy not more than n  wide-
       character codes (wide-character codes that follow a null wide-character
       code are not copied) from the array pointed to  by  ws2  to  the  array
       pointed  to  by ws1.  If copying takes place between objects that over‐
       lap, the behavior is undefined.

       If the array pointed to by ws2  is  a  wide-character  string  that  is
       shorter than n wide-character codes, null wide-character codes shall be
       appended to the copy in the array pointed to by ws1, until n wide-char‐
       acter codes in all are written.

RETURN VALUE
       If any null wide-character codes were written into the destination, the
       wcpncpy() function shall return the address  of  the  first  such  null
       wide-character code. Otherwise, it shall return &ws1[n].

       The wcsncpy() function shall return ws1.

       No return values are reserved to indicate an error.

ERRORS
       No errors are defined.

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       If  there  is no null wide-character code in the first n wide-character
       codes of the array pointed to by ws2, the  result  is  not  null-termi‐
       nated.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
