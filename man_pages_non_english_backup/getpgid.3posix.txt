GETPGID(3POSIX)            POSIX Programmer's Manual           GETPGID(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       getpgid -- get the process group ID for a process

SYNOPSIS
       #include <unistd.h>

       pid_t getpgid(pid_t pid);

DESCRIPTION
       The getpgid() function shall return the process group ID of the process
       whose  process  ID  is  equal  to pid.  If pid is equal to 0, getpgid()
       shall return the process group ID of the calling process.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, getpgid() shall return a process group  ID.
       Otherwise,  it shall return (pid_t)-1 and set errno to indicate the er-
       ror.

ERRORS
       The getpgid() function shall fail if:

       EPERM  The process whose process ID is equal to pid is not in the  same
              session  as the calling process, and the implementation does not
              allow access to the process group ID of that  process  from  the
              calling process.

       ESRCH  There is no process with a process ID equal to pid.

       The getpgid() function may fail if:

       EINVAL The value of the pid argument is invalid.
