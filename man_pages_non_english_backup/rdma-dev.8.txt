NAME
       rdma-dev - RDMA device configuration

SYNOPSIS
       rdma [ OPTIONS ] dev  { COMMAND | help }

       OPTIONS := { -V[ersion] | -d[etails] }

       rdma dev show [ DEV ]

       rdma dev set [ DEV ] name NEWNAME

       rdma dev set [ DEV ] netns NSNAME

       rdma dev set [ DEV ] adaptive-moderation [on/off]

       rdma dev add [ NAME ] type [ TYPE ] parent [ PARENT_DEV ]

       rdma dev delete [ NAME ]

       rdma dev help

DESCRIPTION
   rdma dev set - rename RDMA device or set network namespace or set RDMA de‐
       vice adaptive-moderation
   rdma dev show - display RDMA device attributes
       DEV - specifies the RDMA device to show.  If this argument is omitted
       all devices are listed.

   rdma dev add - Add a RDMA device with a specific type and parent IB device;
       This new device provides subset of functionalities defined in IBTA
       spec.
   rdma dev delete - Delete a RDMA device which is created with the add com‐
       mand.
       NAME - The name of the device being added/deleted.

       TYPE - The type of the device being added; It specifies which function‐
       alities it provides. Supported device type:

               SMI - A device with this type provides SMI (QP0) interface.
               This device and it's parent associates with the same HCA port
               and shares the physical link, so when the parent doesn't sup‐
               port SMI, then this type of device can be created to allow the
               subnet manager to configure the link.

       PARENT_DEV - The name of its parent IB device.

EXAMPLES
       rdma dev
           Shows the state of all RDMA devices on the system.

       rdma dev show mlx5_3
           Shows the state of specified RDMA device.

       rdma dev set mlx5_3 name rdma_0
           Renames the mlx5_3 device to rdma_0.

       rdma dev set mlx5_3 netns foo
           Changes the network namespace of RDMA device to foo where foo is
           previously created using iproute2 ip command.

       rdma dev set mlx5_3 adaptive-moderation [on/off]
           Sets the state of adaptive interrupt moderation for the RDMA de‐
           vice.
           This is a global setting for the RDMA device but the value is
           printed for each CQ individually because the state is constant from
           CQ allocation.

       rdma dev add smi1 type SMI parent ibp8s0f1
           Add a new IB device with name "smi1", type "SMI", and "ibp8s0f1" as
           its parent device.

       rdma dev delete smi1
           Delete the IB device "smi1".
