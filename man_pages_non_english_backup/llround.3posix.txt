LLROUND(3POSIX)            POSIX Programmer's Manual           LLROUND(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       llround, llroundf, llroundl — round to nearest integer value

SYNOPSIS
       #include <math.h>

       long long llround(double x);
       long long llroundf(float x);
       long long llroundl(long double x);

DESCRIPTION
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with  the
       ISO C  standard.  Any  conflict between the requirements described here
       and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017
       defers to the ISO C standard.

       These  functions  shall  round  their  argument  to the nearest integer
       value, rounding halfway cases away from zero, regardless of the current
       rounding direction.

       An  application  wishing to check for error situations should set errno
       to zero and  call  feclearexcept(FE_ALL_EXCEPT)  before  calling  these
       functions. On return, if errno is non-zero or fetestexcept(FE_INVALID |
       FE_DIVBYZERO | FE_OVERFLOW | FE_UNDERFLOW) is non-zero,  an  error  has
       occurred.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon  successful  completion,  these functions shall return the rounded
       integer value.

       If x is NaN, a domain error shall occur, and an  unspecified  value  is
       returned.

       If  x  is  +Inf, a domain error shall occur and an unspecified value is
       returned.

       If x is -Inf, a domain error shall occur and an  unspecified  value  is
       returned.

       If  the  correct value is positive and too large to represent as a long
       long, an unspecified value shall be returned.  On systems that  support
       the IEC 60559 Floating-Point option, a domain error shall occur; other‐
       wise, a domain error may occur.

       If the correct value is negative and too large to represent as  a  long
       long,  an unspecified value shall be returned.  On systems that support
       the IEC 60559 Floating-Point option, a domain error shall occur; other‐
       wise, a domain error may occur.

ERRORS
       These functions shall fail if:

       Domain Error
                   The  x argument is NaN or ±Inf, or the correct value is not
                   representable as an integer.

                   If the integer expression (math_errhandling  &  MATH_ERRNO)
                   is non-zero, then errno shall be set to [EDOM].  If the in‐
                   teger expression  (math_errhandling  &  MATH_ERREXCEPT)  is
                   non-zero,  then  the invalid floating-point exception shall
                   be raised.

       These functions may fail if:

       Domain Error
                   The correct value is not representable as an integer.

                   If the integer expression (math_errhandling  &  MATH_ERRNO)
                   is non-zero, then errno shall be set to [EDOM].  If the in‐
                   teger expression  (math_errhandling  &  MATH_ERREXCEPT)  is
                   non-zero,  then  the invalid floating-point exception shall
                   be raised.

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       On error, the expressions (math_errhandling & MATH_ERRNO) and (math_er‐
       rhandling & MATH_ERREXCEPT) are independent of each other, but at least
       one of them must be non-zero.

RATIONALE
       These functions differ from the llrint() functions in that the  default
       rounding direction for the llround() functions round halfway cases away
       from zero and need not raise the inexact floating-point  exception  for
       non-integer  arguments  that  round  to  within the range of the return
       type.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
