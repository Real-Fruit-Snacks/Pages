PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       sched_get_priority_max, sched_get_priority_min —  get  priority  limits
       (REALTIME)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sched.h>

       int sched_get_priority_max(int policy);
       int sched_get_priority_min(int policy);

DESCRIPTION
       The  sched_get_priority_max()  and  sched_get_priority_min()  functions
       shall return the appropriate maximum or minimum, respectively, for  the
       scheduling policy specified by policy.

       The  value  of  policy shall be one of the scheduling policy values de‐
       fined in <sched.h>.

RETURN VALUE
       If  successful,  the  sched_get_priority_max()   and   sched_get_prior‐
       ity_min()  functions  shall  return  the appropriate maximum or minimum
       values, respectively. If unsuccessful, they shall return a value of  -1
       and set errno to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The  sched_get_priority_max()  and  sched_get_priority_min()  functions
       shall fail if:

       EINVAL The value of the policy parameter does not represent  a  defined
              scheduling policy.
