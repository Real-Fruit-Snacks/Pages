PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       setuid — set user ID

SYNOPSIS
       #include <unistd.h>

       int setuid(uid_t uid);

DESCRIPTION
       If the process has appropriate privileges, setuid() shall set the  real
       user  ID,  effective  user ID, and the saved set-user-ID of the calling
       process to uid.

       If the process does not have appropriate privileges, but uid  is  equal
       to  the  real  user ID or the saved set-user-ID, setuid() shall set the
       effective user ID to uid; the real user ID and saved set-user-ID  shall
       remain unchanged.

       The  setuid() function shall not affect the supplementary group list in
       any way.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, 0 shall be returned. Otherwise, -1 shall be
       returned and errno set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The  setuid() function shall fail, return -1, and set errno to the cor‐
       responding value if one or more of the following are true:

       EINVAL The value of the uid argument is invalid and  not  supported  by
              the implementation.

       EPERM  The  process  does  not have appropriate privileges and uid does
              not match the real user ID or the saved set-user-ID.

       The following sections are informative.

APPLICATION USAGE
       None.

RATIONALE
       The various behaviors of  the  setuid()  and  setgid()  functions  when
       called  by  non-privileged  processes reflect the behavior of different
       historical implementations. For portability, it is recommended that new
       non-privileged  applications  use the seteuid() and setegid() functions
       instead.

       The saved set-user-ID capability allows a program to regain the  effec‐
       tive  user  ID  established at the last exec call. Similarly, the saved
       set-group-ID capability allows a program to regain the effective  group
       ID  established  at  the last exec call. These capabilities are derived
       from System V. Without them, a program might have to run  as  superuser
       in  order to perform the same functions, because superuser can write on
       the user's files. This is a problem because such a program can write on
       any  user's files, and so must be carefully written to emulate the per‐
       missions of the calling process properly. In System V, these  capabili‐
       ties have traditionally been implemented only via the setuid() and set‐
       gid() functions for non-privileged processes. The fact that the  behav‐
       ior of those functions was different for privileged processes made them
       difficult to use. The POSIX.1‐1990 standard defined the setuid()  func‐
       tion to behave differently for privileged and unprivileged users.  When
       the caller had appropriate privileges, the function set the  real  user
       ID,  effective user ID, and saved set-user ID of the calling process on
       implementations that supported it. When the caller did not have  appro‐
       priate privileges, the function set only the effective user ID, subject
       to permission checks. The former use is generally needed for  utilities
       like  login and su, which are not conforming applications and thus out‐
       side the scope of POSIX.1‐2008. These utilities wish to change the user
       ID  irrevocably to a new value, generally that of an unprivileged user.
       The latter use is needed for conforming applications that are installed
       with  the set-user-ID bit and need to perform operations using the real
       user ID.

       POSIX.1‐2008 augments the latter functionality with a mandatory feature
       named  _POSIX_SAVED_IDS. This feature permits a set-user-ID application
       to switch its effective user ID back and forth between  the  values  of
       its  exec-time  real  user ID and effective user ID. Unfortunately, the
       POSIX.1‐1990 standard did not permit  a  conforming  application  using
       this feature to work properly when it happened to be executed with (im‐
       plementation-defined) appropriate privileges. Furthermore, the applica‐
       tion  did  not even have a means to tell whether it had this privilege.
       Since the saved set-user-ID feature is  quite  desirable  for  applica‐
       tions, as evidenced by the fact that NIST required it in FIPS 151‐2, it
       has been mandated by POSIX.1‐2008. However, there are implementors  who
       have been reluctant to support it given the limitation described above.

       The 4.3BSD system handles the problem by supporting separate functions:
       setuid() (which always sets both the real and effective user IDs,  like
       setuid()  in  POSIX.1‐2008  for privileged users), and seteuid() (which
       always sets just the effective user ID, like setuid()  in  POSIX.1‐2008
       for  non-privileged  users). This separation of functionality into dis‐
       tinct functions seems desirable. 4.3BSD does not support the saved set-
       user-ID feature. It supports similar functionality of switching the ef‐
       fective user ID back and forth via setreuid(), which permits  reversing
       the  real  and effective user IDs. This model seems less desirable than
       the saved set-user-ID because the real user ID changes  as  a  side-ef‐
       fect. The current 4.4BSD includes saved effective IDs and uses them for
       seteuid() and setegid() as described  above.  The  setreuid()  and  se‐
       tregid() functions will be deprecated or removed.

       The solution here is:

        *  Require  that  all implementations support the functionality of the
           saved set-user-ID, which is set by the exec functions and by privi‐
           leged calls to setuid().

        *  Add  the seteuid() and setegid() functions as portable alternatives
           to setuid() and setgid() for  non-privileged  and  privileged  pro‐
           cesses.

       Historical  systems  have  provided  two  mechanisms  for a set-user-ID
       process to change its effective user ID to be the same as its real user
       ID  in  such  a way that it could return to the original effective user
       ID: the use of the setuid() function in the presence of  a  saved  set-
       user-ID,  or  the use of the BSD setreuid() function, which was able to
       swap  the  real  and  effective  user  IDs.  The  changes  included  in
       POSIX.1‐2008  provide  a  new  mechanism using seteuid() in conjunction
       with a saved set-user-ID. Thus, all implementations with  the  new  se‐
       teuid()  mechanism  will have a saved set-user-ID for each process, and
       most of the behavior controlled by _POSIX_SAVED_IDS has been changed to
       agree  with  the case where the option was defined. The kill() function
       is an exception. Implementors of the new seteuid() mechanism will  gen‐
       erally  be required to maintain compatibility with the older mechanisms
       previously supported by their systems. However, compatibility with this
       use  of  setreuid() and with the _POSIX_SAVED_IDS behavior of kill() is
       unfortunately complicated. If an implementation with a saved  set-user-
       ID  allows  a  process to use setreuid() to swap its real and effective
       user IDs, but were to  leave  the  saved  set-user-ID  unmodified,  the
       process would then have an effective user ID equal to the original real
       user ID, and both real and saved set-user-ID  would  be  equal  to  the
       original  effective  user ID. In that state, the real user would be un‐
       able to kill the process, even though the  effective  user  ID  of  the
       process  matches  that  of  the  real  user,  if the kill() behavior of
       _POSIX_SAVED_IDS was used. This is obviously not acceptable. The alter‐
       native  choice,  which  is  used  in at least one implementation, is to
       change the saved set-user-ID to the effective user ID during most calls
       to  setreuid().  The standard developers considered that alternative to
       be less correct than the retention of the old  behavior  of  kill()  in
       such  systems. Current conforming applications shall accommodate either
       behavior from kill(), and there appears to  be  no  strong  reason  for
       kill()  to  check  the saved set-user-ID rather than the effective user
       ID.
