CHDIR(3POSIX)              POSIX Programmer's Manual             CHDIR(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       chdir -- change working directory

SYNOPSIS
       #include <unistd.h>

       int chdir(const char *path);

DESCRIPTION
       The chdir() function shall cause the directory named  by  the  pathname
       pointed  to  by  the path argument to become the current working direc-
       tory; that is, the starting point for path searches for  pathnames  not
       beginning with '/'.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, 0 shall be returned. Otherwise, -1 shall be
       returned, the current working directory shall remain unchanged, and er-
       rno shall be set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The chdir() function shall fail if:

       EACCES Search permission is denied for any component of the pathname.

       ELOOP  A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during resolution of
              the path argument.

       ENAMETOOLONG
              The  length  of  a  component  of  a  pathname  is  longer  than
              {NAME_MAX}.

       ENOENT A  component of path does not name an existing directory or path
              is an empty string.

       ENOTDIR
              A component of the pathname names an existing file that is  nei-
              ther a directory nor a symbolic link to a directory.

       The chdir() function may fail if:

       ELOOP  More  than  {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were encountered during
              resolution of the path argument.

       ENAMETOOLONG
              The length of a pathname exceeds {PATH_MAX}, or pathname resolu-
              tion  of  a symbolic link produced an intermediate result with a
              length that exceeds {PATH_MAX}.

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
   Changing the Current Working Directory
       The following example makes the value pointed to  by  directory,  /tmp,
       the current working directory.

           #include <unistd.h>
           ...
           char *directory = "/tmp";
           int ret;

           ret = chdir (directory);

APPLICATION USAGE
       None.

RATIONALE
       The  chdir() function only affects the working directory of the current
       process.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
