WCSTOMBS(3POSIX)           POSIX Programmer's Manual          WCSTOMBS(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       wcstombs — convert a wide-character string to a character string

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdlib.h>

       size_t wcstombs(char *restrict s, const wchar_t *restrict pwcs,
           size_t n);

DESCRIPTION
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with  the
       ISO C  standard.  Any  conflict between the requirements described here
       and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017
       defers to the ISO C standard.

       The  wcstombs()  function  shall convert the sequence of wide-character
       codes that are in the array pointed to by pwcs into a sequence of char‐
       acters  that  begins in the initial shift state and store these charac‐
       ters into the array pointed to by s, stopping if a character would  ex‐
       ceed the limit of n total bytes or if a null byte is stored. Each wide-
       character code shall be converted as if by a call to  wctomb(),  except
       that the shift state of wctomb() shall not be affected.

       The  behavior  of this function shall be affected by the LC_CTYPE cate‐
       gory of the current locale.

       No more than n bytes shall be modified in the array pointed  to  by  s.
       If  copying  takes  place between objects that overlap, the behavior is
       undefined.  If s is a null pointer, wcstombs() shall return the  length
       required  to convert the entire array regardless of the value of n, but
       no values are stored.

RETURN VALUE
       If a wide-character code is encountered that does not correspond  to  a
       valid  character  (of  one or more bytes each), wcstombs() shall return
       (size_t)-1. Otherwise, wcstombs() shall  return  the  number  of  bytes
       stored in the character array, not including any terminating null byte.
       The array shall not be null-terminated if the value returned is n.

ERRORS
       The wcstombs() function shall fail if:

       EILSEQ A wide-character code does not correspond to a valid character.
