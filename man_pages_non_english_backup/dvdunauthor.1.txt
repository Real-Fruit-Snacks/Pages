NAME
       dvdunauthor - Decodes DVD-Video file structure

SYNOPSIS
       dvdunauthor [ path ]

DESCRIPTION
       dvdunauthor   decodes  the  specified  DVD-Video  directory  structure,
       putting into the current directory an XML control file and  correspond-
       ing MPEG-2 files (with a .vob extension) that dvdauthor can (hopefully)
       interpret to recreate the DVD-Video directory structure.

USAGE
       dvdunauthor path

CAVEATS
       None.

BUGS
       Depends on libdvdread to decode the DVD-Video structure and  to  report
       any  errors  trying  to  do so. But libdvdread will sometimes just exit
       without reporting any error.
