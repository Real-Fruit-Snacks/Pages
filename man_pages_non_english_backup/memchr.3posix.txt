MEMCHR(3POSIX)             POSIX Programmer's Manual            MEMCHR(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       memchr — find byte in memory

SYNOPSIS
       #include <string.h>

       void *memchr(const void *s, int c, size_t n);

DESCRIPTION
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with  the
       ISO C  standard.  Any  conflict between the requirements described here
       and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017
       defers to the ISO C standard.

       The memchr() function shall locate the first occurrence of c (converted
       to an unsigned char) in the initial n bytes (each  interpreted  as  un‐
       signed char) pointed to by s.

       Implementations  shall  behave  as if they read the memory byte by byte
       from the beginning of the bytes pointed to by s and stop at  the  first
       occurrence of c (if it is found in the initial n bytes).

RETURN VALUE
       The  memchr() function shall return a pointer to the located byte, or a
       null pointer if the byte is not found.

ERRORS
       No errors are defined.
