fputws(3)                  Library Functions Manual                  fputws(3)

NAME
       fputws - write a wide-character string to a FILE stream

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       int fputws(const wchar_t *restrict ws, FILE *restrict stream);

DESCRIPTION
       The  fputws() function is the wide-character equivalent of the fputs(3)
       function.  It writes the wide-character string starting at  ws,  up  to
       but  not  including  the  terminating  null  wide character (L'\0'), to
       stream.

       For a nonlocking counterpart, see unlocked_stdio(3).

RETURN VALUE
       The fputws() function returns a nonnegative integer  if  the  operation
       was successful, or -1 to indicate an error.

ATTRIBUTES
       For  an  explanation  of  the  terms  used  in  this  section,  see at-

STANDARDS
       POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, C99.

NOTES
       The behavior of fputws() depends on the LC_CTYPE category of  the  cur-
       rent locale.

       In  the  absence of additional information passed to the fopen(3) call,
       it is reasonable to expect that fputws() will actually write the multi-
       byte string corresponding to the wide-character string ws.
