NAME
       sane-kvs40xx  - SANE backend for Panasonic KV-S40xxC USB/SCSI ADF scan‐
       ners.

DESCRIPTION
       The sane-kvs40xx library implements a SANE (Scanner  Access  Now  Easy)
       backend  which provides access to the Panasonic KV-S40xxC and KV-S70xxC
       scanners.

KNOWN ISSUES
       This document was written by the SANE project, which has no information
       regarding  the capabilities or reliability of the backend. All informa‐
       tion contained here is suspect.

       The backend uses pthreads directly, and so requires pthreads to be  en‐
       abled.

CREDITS
       The backend was written by Panasonic Russia Ltd.

       The backend was ported to sane-backends 1.0.23 and downgraded to C89 by
       m. allan noah.
