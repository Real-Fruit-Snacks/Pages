NAME
       pamtable - print the raster as a table of numerical sample values

SYNOPSIS
       pamtable

       [netpbmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       pamtable  prints  the  raster of a Netpbm image as a table of numerical
       sample values.  For example,  a  5-pixel  wide,  2-pixel  high  rainbow
       (black, red, green, blue, white) PPM image with maxval 255 would appear
       as follows:

               0   0   0|255   0   0|  0 255   0|  0   0 255|255 255 255
               0   0   0|255   0   0|  0 255   0|  0   0 255|255 255 255

       If you care to see only certain rows or columns, use pamcut  to  filter
       the input.

       If  you  care  to see only certain planes, use pamchannel to filter the
       input.

       pamtable prints vertical bars between tuples, unless there is only  one
       sample  per  tuple,  in which case it prints a single space between tu‐
       ples.

       pamtable prints a single space between samples within a tuple.

       For each sample, pamtable prints the numerical value  from  the  Netpbm
       image,  uninterpreted.  It prints it in decimal, right justified in the
       minimum number of spaces required to print the maxval of the image.

       If you want the samples to print more densely, use pamdepth  to  reduce
       the maxval (thus making the decimal numbers for the samples narrower).

       The  less program (not part of Netpbm) is good for browsing through the
       table.  Use its --chop-long-lines option and use cursor  movement  keys
       to scroll around in the image.

ARGUMENTS
       The only possible argument is the name of the file containing the input
       Netpbm image.  This is optional; if you don't  specify  any  arguments,
       the input comes from Standard Input.

OPTIONS
       There  are  no  command line options defined specifically for pamtable,
       but it recognizes the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm
       (See
        Common Options ⟨index.html#commonoptions⟩ .)

HISTORY
       pamtable was new in Netpbm 10.79 (June 2017).
