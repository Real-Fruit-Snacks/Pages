deb-preinst(5)                    dpkg suite                    deb-preinst(5)

NAME
       deb-preinst - package pre-installation maintainer script

SYNOPSIS
       DEBIAN/preinst

DESCRIPTION
       A package can perform several pre-installation actions via maintainer
       scripts, by including an executable preinst file in its control archive
       (i.e. DEBIAN/preinst during package creation).

       The script can be called in the following ways:

       new-preinst install
           Before the package is installed.

       new-preinst install old-version new-version
           Before a removed package is upgraded.

           The new-version is passed only since dpkg 1.18.5.

       new-preinst upgrade old-version new-version
           Before the package is upgraded.

           The new-version is passed only since dpkg 1.18.5.

       old-preinst abort-upgrade new-version
           If postrm fails during upgrade or fails on failed upgrade.
