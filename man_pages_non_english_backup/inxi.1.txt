       and more advanced options.

DESCRIPTION
       inxi  is  a  command line system information tool built for console and
       IRC. It is also used as a debugging tool for forum technical support to
       quickly ascertain users' system configurations and hardware. inxi shows
       system hardware, CPU, drivers, Xorg,  Desktop,  Kernel,  compiler  ver-
       sion(s),  Processes,  RAM usage, and a wide variety of other useful in-
       formation.

       inxi output varies depending on whether it is being used on CLI or IRC,
       with  some  default filters and color options applied only for IRC use.
       Colors can be turned off if desired with -c 0, or changed using the  -c
       color options listed in the STANDARD OPTIONS section below.

PRIVACY AND SECURITY
       In order to maintain basic privacy and security, inxi used on IRC auto-
       matically filters out your network device MAC address, WAN and LAN  IP,
       your /home username directory in partitions, and a few other items.

       Because  inxi is often used on forums for support, you can also trigger
       this filtering with the -z option (-ez, for example). To  override  the
       IRC  filter, you can use the -Z option. This can be useful in debugging
       network connection issues online in a private chat, for example.

       See FILTER OPTIONS for all filters. If you want to  filter  everything,
       use --za though that's usually overkill.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
       This man page is pretty long and information packed. It is divided into
       the following sections:

       * USING OPTIONS How to use the command line options.

       * STANDARD OPTIONS Primary data types trigger items.

       * FILTER OPTIONS Apply a variety of output filters.

       * OUTPUT CONTROL OPTIONS Change default colors, widths, heights, output
       types, etc.

       *  EXTRA DATA OPTIONS What -x, -xx, and -xxx add to the report per pri-
       mary data type.

       * ADMIN EXTRA DATA OPTIONS What -a adds to the report per primary  data
       type.  These  have  a lot of information because this is advanced admin
       data, which are not always intuitive or easy to understand.

       * ADVANCED OPTIONS Modify behavior or choice of data sources, and other
       advanced switches.

       *  DEBUGGING  OPTIONS  For  development  use  mainly,  or  contributing
       datasets to the project.

       * DEBUGGING OPTIONS TO DEBUG DEBUGGER FAILURES Only for advanced users,
       sometimes  something  will  hang  the debuggers, this shows you various
       ways to get around those failures.

       * SUPPORTED IRC CLIENTS List of known good IRC clients. Not checked of-
       ten, let us know if something is not working.

       * RUNNING IN IRC CLIENT How to run inxi in various IRC clients.

       *  CONFIGURATION  FILE Configuration file locations and priority in us-
       ing.

       * CONFIGURATION OPTIONS Most of the  commonly  used  configuration  op-
       tions, along with sample values.

       * BUGS How and where to report bugs.

       * HOMEPAGE, AUTHOR AND CONTRIBUTORS TO CODE, SPECIAL THANKS TO THE FOL-
       LOWING These are self explanitory.

USING OPTIONS
       Options can be combined if they do not conflict. You can  either  group
       the letters together or separate them.

       Letters  with  numbers can have no gap or a gap at your discretion, ex-
       cept when using  -t. Note that if you use an option  that  requires  an
       additional  argument,  that must be last in the short form group of op-
       tions. Otherwise you can use those separately as well.

       For example: inxi -AG | inxi -A -G  |  inxi  -b  |  inxi  -c10  |  inxi
       -exxzJy90 | inxi -bay

       Note  that all the short form options have long form equivalents, which
       are listed below. However, usually the short form is used  in  examples
       in order to keep things simple.

STANDARD OPTIONS
       -A , --audio
              Show Audio/sound device(s) information, including device driver.
              Shows active sound API(s) and sound server(s).

              Supported  APIs:  ALSA,  OSS,  sndio.  Supported  servers:  aRts
              (artsd), Enlightened Sound Daemon (esound, esd), JACK, NAS (Net-
              work  Audio  System,  nasd),  PipeWire,  PulseAudio,  RoarAudio,
              sndiod.

              Use -Ax to show all sound APIs/servers detected, including inac-
              tive, -Axx to see API/Server helper daemons/plugin/modules,  and
              -Aa to see API/sound server tools.

              Audio:
                Device-1: C-Media CMI8788 [Oxygen HD Audio] driver: snd_virtuoso
                Device-2: AMD Cedar HDMI Audio [Radeon HD 5400/6300/7300 Series]
                  driver: snd_hda_intel
                Device-3: AMD Family 17h HD Audio driver: snd_hda_intel
                API: ALSA v: k5.19.0-16.2-liquorix-amd64 status: kernel-api
                Server-1: PulseAudio v: 16.1 status: active

       -b , --basic
              Show basic report with the following items: System (-S); Machine
              (-M); Battery (-B) (if available); basic CPU (cores, type, aver-
              age  clock  speed,  and  min/max speeds, if available); Graphics
              (-G); Networking devices (-N); basic Disk; Info (-I).

              The CPU and Disk short forms are special, and are only  used  in
              -b. To see their full forms, add -C or -D.

              Same as: inxi -v 2

              For expanded -b report, see -e/--expanded.

       -B , --battery
              Show  system  battery (ID-x) data, charge, condition, plus extra
              information (if battery present). Uses /sys or, for BSDs without
              systctl  battery  data, use --dmidecode to force its use. dmide-
              code does not have very much information, and none about current
              battery  state/charge/voltage.  Supports multiple batteries when
              using /sys or sysctl data.

              Note that for charge:, the report shows the current  charge,  as
              well  as  its  value  as a percentage of the available capacity,
              which can be less than the original design capacity. In the fol-
              lowing  example,  the  actual  current available capacity of the
              battery is 22.2 Wh.

              charge: 20.1 Wh (95.4%)

              The condition: item shows the  remaining  available  capacity  /
              original  design  capacity, and then this figure as a percentage
              of original capacity available in the battery.

              condition: 22.2/36.4 Wh (61%)

              With -x, or if voltage difference is critical, volts: item shows
              the current voltage, and the min: voltage. Note that if the cur-
              rent is below the minimum listed the battery is essentially dead
              and  will  not charge.  Test that to confirm, but that's techni-
              cally how it's supposed to work.

              volts: 12.0 min: 11.4

              With -x shows attached Device-x  information  (mouse,  keyboard,
              etc.) if they are battery powered.

       --bluetooth
              See -E.

       -c , --color
              See OUTPUT CONTROL OPTIONS.

       --config, --configuration
              Show active configuration values, by file, and exit.

       -C , --cpu
              Show  full CPU report (if each item available): basic CPU topol-
              ogy, model, type, L2 cache, average speed of all cores (if  >  1
              core,  otherwise speed of the core), min/max speeds for CPU, and
              per CPU clock speed. More data available with -x, -xxx,  and  -a
              options.

              Explanation of CPU type (type: MT MCP) abbreviations:

              *  AMCP  - Asymmetric Multi Core Processor. More than 1 core per
              CPU, and more than one core type (single and multithreaded cores
              in the same CPU).

              *  AMP  - Asymmetric Multi Processing (more than 1 physical CPU,
              but not identical in terms of core counts or min/max speeds).

              * MT - Multi/Hyper Threaded CPU (more than 1  thread  per  core,
              previously HT).

              *  MST  -  Multi and Single Threaded CPU (a CPU with both Single
              and Multi Threaded cores).

              * MCM - Multi Chip Model (more than 1 die per CPU).

              * MCP - Multi Core Processor (more than 1 core per CPU).

              * SMP - Symmetric Multi Processing (more than 1 physical CPU).

              * UP - Uni (single core) Processor.

              Note that min/max: speeds are not necessarily true in  cases  of
              overclocked CPUs or CPUs in turbo/boost mode. See -Ca for alter-
              nate base/boost: speed data, more granular cache data, and more.

              Sample:
              CPU:
                Info: 2x 8-core model: Intel Xeon E5-2620 v4 bits: 64 type: MT MCP SMP
                  cache: L2: 2x 2 MiB (4 MiB)
                Speed (MHz): avg: 1601 min/max: 1200/3000 cores: 1: 1280 2: 1595 3: 1416
                  ... 32: 1634

       -d , --disk-full,--optical
              Show optical drive data as well as -D HDD/SSD drive  data.  With
              -x,  adds  a feature line to the report. Also shows floppy disks
              if present. Note that there is no current way to get any  infor-
              mation  about the floppy device that we are aware of, so it will
              simply show the floppy ID without any extra data. -xx adds a few
              more features.

       -D , --disk
              Show  HDD/SSD  drive info. Shows total drive space and used per-
              centage. The drive used percentage includes space used  by  swap
              partition(s), since those are not usable for data storage. Also,
              unmounted partitions are not counted in  drive  use  percentages
              since inxi has no access to the used amount.

              If the system has RAID or other logical storage, and if inxi can
              determine the size of those vs their components,  you  will  see
              the storage total raw and usable sizes, plus the percent used of
              the usable size. The no argument short form of  inxi  will  show
              only  the  usable  (or  total if no usable) and used percent. If
              there is no logical storage detected, only total: and used: will
              show. Sample (with RAID logical size calculated):

              Local  Storage: total: raw: 5.49 TiB usable: 2.80 TiB used: 1.35
              TiB (48.3%)

              Without logical storage detected:

              Local Storage: total: 2.89 TiB used: 1.51 TiB (52.3%)

              Also shows per drive information: Disk ID, type  (FireWire,  Re-
              movable, USB if present), vendor (if detected), model, and size.
              See Extra Data Options (-x options) and Admin Extra Data Options
              (--admin options) for many more features.

       -e , --expanded
              Show expanded -b report. Includes all Upper Case options (except
              -J), plus --swap, -s and -n. Does not show extra verbose options
              such as -d -f -i -J -l -m -o -p -r -t -u -x unless you use those
              arguments in the command, e.g.: inxi -ermxx

              The basic CPU line is expanded to full CPU data (-C); the  basic
              disk information line is expanded to full drive information (-D)
              plus primary system partion data (-P),  along  with  adding,  if
              found,  RAID  (-R) and Logical (-L) items; the Network line (-N)
              is expanded to advanced network (-n).

              Note that with -e, to avoid clutter, -B, -E,  -L,  and  -R  only
              show if results are found since those are often not relevant.

              For basic report, see -b/--basic.

              The  previous  -F/--full are deprecated because the expanded re-
              port has not been full for a long time.

       -E, --bluetooth
              Show bluetooth device(s), drivers. Show  Report:  with  HCI  ID,
              state,  address per device (requires btmgmt, bt-adapter, or hci-
              config), and if available  (hciconfig,  btmgmt  only)  bluetooth
              version (bt-v). See Extra Data Options for more.

              If  bluetooth shows as status: down, shows bt-service: state and
              rfkill software and hardware blocked states, and rfkill ID.

              Note that Report-ID: indicates that the HCI item was not able to
              be linked to a specific device, similar to IF-ID: in -n.

              If  your  internal bluetooth device does not show, it's possible
              that it has been disabled, if you try enabling it using for  ex-
              ample:

              hciconfig hci0 up

              and  it  returns  a  blocked by RF-Kill error, you can do one of
              these:

              connmanctl enable bluetooth

              or

              rfkill list bluetooth

              rfkill unblock bluetooth

       --edid
              Triggers full EDID data in Graphics, activates -G and -a.

              -        Adds        monitor         chromacity         (chroma:
              red:..green:...blue:...white:).

              -  Shows  all  available  monitor modes if > 2 present, in comma
              separated list.

              - Shows EDID errors and warnings if any present.

       --filter, -z
              See FILTER OPTIONS.

       -f , --flags
              Show all CPU flags used, not just the short list. Not shown with
              -e in order to avoid spamming. ARM CPUs: show features items.

       -F , --full
              Deprecated. See -e/--expanded.

       -G , --graphics
              Show  Graphic device(s) information, including details of device
              and display drivers (X: loaded:, and, if applicable:  unloaded:,
              failed:,  dri:  (if X and different from loaded X drivers) driv-
              ers, and active gpu: drivers), display protocol (if  available),
              display  server  (and/or Wayland compositor), vendor and version
              number, e.g.:

              Display: x11 server: Xorg v: 1.15.1

              or:

              Display: wayland server: X.org v: 1.20.1 with: Xwayland v: 20.1

              If protocol is not detected, shows:

              Display: server: Xorg 1.15.1

              Adds with: Xwayland v:... if xwayland server is  installed,  re-
              gardless of protocol.

              Also  shows  screen  resolution(s) (per monitor/X screen). Shows
              graphics API information (if available). EGL: EGL version, driv-
              ers,  acdtive  platforms;  OpenGL: renderer, OpenGL core profile
              version/OpenGL version (if core/compat versions different, shows
              that  as  well); Vulkan: Vulkan version, drivers, surfaces;VESA:
              data (for Xvesa).

              Compositor information will show if detected using -xx option or
              always  if  detected  and  Wayland  since  the compositor is the
              server with Wayland.

              -Gxx shows monitor data as well, if detected. --edid  shows  ad-
              vanced monitor data (full modes, chroma, etc.).

       -h , --help
              The help menu. Features dynamic sizing to fit into terminal win-
              dow. Set global COLS_MAX_CONSOLE if you want a different default
              value, or use -y [width] to temporarily override the defaults or
              actual window width.

       -i , --ip
              Show WAN IP address and local interfaces (latter requires ifcon-
              fig  or ip network tool), as well as network report from -n. Not
              shown with -e for user security  reasons.  You  shouldn't  paste
              your local/WAN IP.  Shows both IPv4 and IPv6 link IP addresses.

       --ip-limit, --limit [-1 - x]
              Raise  or  lower max report limit of IP addresses for -i. -1 re-
              moves limit.

       -I , --info
              Show Information: processes,  uptime,  memory,  IRC  client  (or
              shell  type  if  run  in shell, not IRC), inxi version. See -Ix,
              -Ixx, and -Ia for extra  information  (init  type/version,  run-
              level/target, packages).

              Note:  if -m or -tm are active, the memory item will show in the
              main Memory: report of -m/-tm/, not in Info:.

              See -m for explanation of Memory: fields and values..

       -j, --swap
              Shows all active swap types (partition, file, zram).  When  this
              option  is  used, swap partition(s) will not show on the -P line
              to avoid redundancy.

              To show partition labels or UUIDs (when available and relevant),
              use with -l or -u.

       -J , --usb
              Show USB data for attached Hubs and Devices. Hubs also show num-
              ber of ports. Be aware that a port is not always external,  some
              may be internal, and either used or unused (for example, a moth-
              erboard USB header connector that is not used).

              Hubs and Devices are listed in order of BusID.

              BusID is generally in this format:  BusID-port[.port][.port]:De-
              viceID

              Device  ID  is a number created by the kernel, and has no neces-
              sary ordering or sequence connection, but can be used  to  match
              this output to lsusb values, which generally shows BusID / Devi-
              ceID (except for tree view, which shows ports).

              Examples: Device-3: 4-3.2.1:2 or Hub: 4-0:1

              The rev: 2.0 item refers to the USB revision number, like 1.0 or
              3.1.

              Use  -Jx  for basic Si base 10 bits/s speed, -Jxx for Si and IEC
              base 2 Bytes/s speeds. -Ja adds USB mode.

       -l , --label
              Show partition labels. Use with -j, -o, -p, and -P to show  par-
              tition labels. Requires one of those options.

              Sample: -ojpl.

       -L, --logical
              Show  Logical  volume  information,  for LVM, LUKS, bcache, etc.
              Shows size, free space (for LVM VG). For LVM, shows Device-[xx]:
              VG: (Volume Group) size/free, LV-[xx] (Logical Volume). LV shows
              type, size, and components.  Note that components are made up of
              either  containers  (aka, logical devices), or physical devices.
              The full report requires doas/sudo/root.

              Logical block devices can be thought of as devices that are made
              up  out  of  either  other logical devices, or physical devices.
              inxi does its best to show what each logical device is made  out
              of.  RAID devices form a subset of all possible Logical devices,
              but have their own section, -R.

              If -R is used with -Lxx, -Lxx will not show RAID information for
              LVM RAID devices since it's redundant. If -R is not used, a sim-
              ple RAID line will appear for LVM RAID in -Lxx.

              -Lxx also shows all components and devices. Note that since com-
              ponents  can go in many levels, each level per primary component
              is indicated by either another 'c', or ends with a  'p'  device,
              the  physical  device.  The  number  of c's or p's indicates the
              depth, so you can see which component belongs to which.

              -L shows only the top level components/devices (like  -R).   -La
              shows  component/device size, maj:min ID, mapped name (if appli-
              cable), and puts each component/device on its own line.

              Sample:

                Device-10: mybackup type: LUKS dm: dm-28 size: 6.36 GiB Components:
                  c-1: md1 cc-1: dm-26 ppp-1: sdj2 cc-2: dm-27 ppp-1: sdk2
                LV-5: lvm_raid1 type: raid1 dm: dm-16 size: 4.88 GiB
                  RAID: stripes: 2 sync: idle copied: 100% mismatches: 0
                Components: c-1: dm-10 pp-1: sdd1 c-2: dm-11 pp-1: sdd1 c-3: dm-13
                  pp-1: sde1 c-4: dm-15 pp-1: sde1

              It is easier to follow the flow of components and devices  using
              -y1. In this example, there is one primary component (c-1), md1,
              which is made up of two components (cc-1,2),  dm-26  and  dm-27.
              These are respectively made from physical devices (p-1) sdj2 and
              sdk2.

              Other types of logical block handling like LUKS, bcache show as:

              Device-[xx] [name/id] type: [LUKS|Crypto|bcache]:

       -m , --memory
              Memory (RAM) data. Does not display with -b or -e unless you use
              -m  explicitly.  Ordered  by system board physical system memory
              array(s) (Array-[number]), and individual  memory  devices  (De-
              vice-[number]).   Physical  memory array data shows array capac-
              ity, number of devices supported, and Error Correction  informa-
              tion.  Devices  shows  locator data (highly variable in syntax),
              type (eg: type: DDR3)size, speed.

              Note: inxi -m uses either dboot (BSDs),  dmidecode,  or  udevadm
              (Linux)  to  collect  the  RAM data. Not all boards have DMI RAM
              data available.

              dmidecode must be run as root (or start  inxi  with  doas/sudo),
              unless  you  figure out how to set up doas/sudo to permit dmide-
              code to read /dev/mem as user.

              udevadm can be run by non-superuser, or if dmidecode is not  in-
              stalled  (Linux only). It has a slightly less reliable dmi table
              report, and does not seem to support more than  1  board  memory
              array, but is pretty good. Voltages may be wrong however.

              Both  dmidecode  and  udevadm  need a DMI table with RAM data to
              create the report. Most SBC/SOC boards don't have dmi based  RAM
              data. But most other machines do.

              speed  and  bus-width  will  not  show if no module installed is
              found in size.

              Note: If -m is triggered RAM available/used report  will  appear
              in this section, not in -I or -tm items.

              Because dmi source data is somewhat unreliable, inxi will try to
              make best guesses. If you see (check) after the capacity number,
              you  should  check it with the specifications. (est) is slightly
              more reliable, but you should still check  the  real  specifica-
              tions before buying RAM. Unfortunately there is nothing inxi can
              do to get truly reliable data about the system  RAM;  maybe  one
              day  the  kernel  devs will put this data into /sys, and make it
              real data, taken from the actual system, not dmi data. For  most
              people,  the data will be right, but a significant percentage of
              users will have either a wrong max module size, if available, or
              max capacity.

              Under  dmidecode/udevadm,  speed:  is  the expected speed of the
              memory (spec:, what is advertised on the memory spec sheet)  and
              actual:,  what the actual speed is now. To handle this, if speed
              and configured speed values are different, you will see this in-
              stead:

              speed: spec: [specified speed] MT/s actual: [actual] MT/s

              Also,  if  DDR, and speed in MHz, will change to: speed: [speed]
              MT/s ([speed] MHz)

              If the detected speed is logically absurd, like 1 MT/s or  69910
              MT/s, adds: note: check. Sample:

              Memory:
                System RAM: total: 32 GiB note: est. available: 31.38 GiB
                  used: 20.65 GiB (65.8%)

                Device-1: DIMM_A1 type: DDR3 size: 8 GiB speed: 1600 MT/s (800 MHz)

              Notes on System RAM: / Memory: report item:

              * total: and igpu: do not show for short form.

              * The total: can come from several possible sources:

              - If not superuser, and if /sys/devices/system/memory exists, it
              will  estimate  the  total  RAM based on how many RAM blocks and
              their size. Sometimes the block count is not an exact  match  to
              installed  RAM,  and  inxi  will attempt to guess the actual RAM
              amount, except for virtual machines. When it synthesizes the ac-
              tual physical RAM total, it will show note: est..

              Note  that  not  all  kernels are compiled to support generating
              this /sys directory (kernel  needs  to  be  compiled  with  CON-
              FIG_MEMORY_HOTPLUG).

              -  For  OpenBSD  and not superuser, the total comes from the de-
              tected RAM in dboot, if available.

              - If superuser, and if -m used, it comes from the dmidecode  RAM
              totals  if  available, and if not, it comes from counting up the
              System RAM ranges in /proc/iomem (Linux only), then rounding up,
              since  that  total is usually slightly under the actual physical
              RAM total. If inxi is unsure about the total, it will show note:
              est..

              If no total data found, shows total: N/A.

              *  The available: item is the total installed RAM minus some re-
              served and kernel code RAM (and in some cases iGPU assigned main
              system RAM) that is allocated on system boot, and thus is gener-
              ally less than the actual physical RAM installed. This is called
              MemTotal  in free/meminfo even though it isn't, though it is the
              total available the kernel has to work with.

              * The used: is the percent of the available RAM used, NOT of the
              total physical RAM.

              * The igpu: item either comes from Raspberry Pi gpu RAM, or from
              /proc/iomem. The latter source is Linux + superuser only, and is
              not  guaranteed  to  be  accurate, but sometimes is. That is for
              iGPU system RAM used, not for standalone GPUs with their own in-
              ternal  RAM.  Not  all types of internal VRAM are detectable, it
              depends on how the hardware assigns RAM to iGPU.

              Raspberry Pi uses vcgencmd get_mem gpu to get gpu RAM amount, if
              user is in video group and vcgencmd is installed.

       --memory-modules, --mm
              Memory  (RAM)  data.  Show only RAM arrays and modules in Memory
              report.  Skip empty slots. See -m.

       --memory-short, --ms
              Memory (RAM) data. Show a one line RAM report in Memory. See -m.

              Sample: Report: arrays: 1 slots: 4 modules: 2 type: DDR4

       -M , --machine
              Show machine data. Device, Motherboard, BIOS,  and  if  present,
              System  Builder (Like Lenovo). Older systems/kernels without the
              required /sys data can use dmidecode instead, run  as  root.  If
              using  dmidecode,  may  also  show BIOS/UEFI revision as well as
              version. --dmidecode forces use of  dmidecode  data  instead  of
              /sys.  Will  also  attempt  to  show if the system was booted by
              BIOS, UEFI, or UEFI [Legacy], the latter being legacy BIOS  boot
              mode in a system board using UEFI.

              Device  information requires either /sys or dmidecode. Note that
              other-vm? is a type that means  it's  usually  a  VM,  but  inxi
              failed  to  detect which type, or positively confirm which VM it
              is. Primary VM identification  is  via  systemd-detect-virt  but
              fallback tests that should also support some BSDs are used. Less
              commonly used or harder to detect VMs may not be  correctly  de-
              tected.  If you get an incorrect report, post an issue and we'll
              get it fixed if possible.

              Due to unreliable vendor data, device type will  show:  desktop,
              laptop,  notebook,  server,  blade, plus some obscure stuff that
              inxi is unlikely to ever run on.

       -n , --network-advanced
              Show Advanced Network device information  in  addition  to  that
              produced by -N. Shows interface, speed, MAC ID, state, etc.

       -N , --network
              Show  Network  device(s)  information,  including device driver.
              With -x, shows Bus ID, Port number.

       -o , --unmounted
              Show unmounted partition information (includes UUID and LABEL if
              available).   Shows file system type if you have lsblk installed
              (Linux only). For BSD/GNU Linux: shows file system type if  file
              is  installed,  and  if  you  are  root  or if you have added to
              /etc/sudoers (sudo v. 1.7 or newer):

              <username> ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/file (sample)

              doas users: see man doas.conf for setup.

              Does not show components (partitions that create the md-raid ar-
              ray) of md-raid arrays.

              To show partition labels or UUIDs (when available and relevant),
              use with -l or -u.

       -p , --partitions-full
              Show full Partition information  (-P  plus  all  other  detected
              mounted partitions).

              To show partition labels or UUIDs (when available and relevant),
              use with -l or -u.

       --partitions-sort,           --ps            [dev-base|fs|id|label|per-
       cent-used|size|uuid|used]
              Change  default  sort  order of partition report. Corresponds to
              PARTITION_SORT configuration item. These are the available  sort
              options:

              dev-base - /dev partition identifier, like /dev/sda1.  Note that
              it's an alphabetic sort, so sda12 is before sda2.

              fs - Partition filesystem. Note that sorts will be somewhat ran-
              dom if all filesystems are the same.

              id - Mount point of partition (default).

              label  -  Label of partition. If partitions have no labels, sort
              will be random.

              percent-used - Percentage of partition size used.

              size - KiB size of partition.

              uuid - UUID of the partition.

              used - KiB used of partition.

       -P , --partitions
              Show basic Partition information.  Shows, if detected:  /  /boot
              /boot/efi  /home /opt /tmp /usr /usr/home /var /var/tmp /var/log
              (for android, shows /cache /data /firmware /system).  If  --swap
              is  not  used, shows active swap partitions (never shows file or
              zram type swap). Use -p to see all mounted partitions.

              To show partition labels or UUIDs (when available and relevant),
              use with -l or -u.

       --processes
              See -t.

       -r , --repos
              Show distro repository data. Currently supported repo types:

              APK (Alpine Linux + derived versions)

              APT (Debian, Ubuntu + derived versions, as well as rpm based apt
              distros like PCLinuxOS or Alt-Linux)

              CARDS (NuTyX + derived versions)

              EMERGE (T2 SDE, svn target URL)

              EOPKG (Solus)

              XBPS (Void)

              YUM/ZYPP (Fedora, Red Hat, Suse + derived versions)

              More will be added as distro data  is  collected.  If  yours  is
              missing please show us how to get this information and we'll try
              to add it.

              See -rx, -rxx, and -ra for installed package count information.

       -R , --raid
              Show RAID data. Shows RAID devices, states, levels, device/array
              size, and components. See extra data with -x / -xx.

              md-raid:  If  device  is  resyncing,  also shows resync progress
              line.

              Note: supported types: lvm raid,  md-raid,  softraid,  ZFS,  and
              hardware  RAID.   Other software RAID types may be added, if the
              software RAID can be made to give the required output.

              The component ID numbers work like this: mdraid:  the  numerator
              is the actual mdraid component number; lvm/softraid/ZFS: the nu-
              merator is auto-incremented counter only. Eg. Online: 1: sdb1

              If hardware RAID is detected, shows basic  information.  Due  to
              complexity  of  adding hardware RAID device disk / RAID reports,
              those will only be added if there is demand, and reasonable  re-
              porting tools.

       --recommends
              Checks  inxi application dependencies and recommends, as well as
              directories, then shows what package(s) you need to  install  to
              add support for each feature.

       -s , --sensors
              Show  report from sensors if sensors installed/configured: Moth-
              erboard/CPU/GPU temperatures; detected fan speeds. GPU  tempera-
              ture  when  available.  Nvidia  shows screen number for multiple
              screens. IPMI sensors are also used (root required) if present.

              See Advanced options --sensors-use or --sensors-exclude  if  you
              want  to  use only a subset of all sensors, or exclude one (cur-
              rently only for lm-sensors and /sys sourced data).

              For  current  Linux,   will   fallback   gracefully   to   using
              /sys/class/hwmon  as sensor data source if lm-sensors is not in-
              stalled. You can compare the two by  using  --force  sensors-sys
              option with -s.

       --slots
              Show PCI slots with type, speed, and status information.

       --swap
              See -j

       -S , --system
              Show  System information: host name, kernel, desktop environment
              (if in X), distro. With -xx show dm - or startx - (only shows if
              present  and  running  if out of X), and if in X, with -xxx show
              more desktop info, e.g. taskbar or panel.

       -t , --processes
              [c|m|cm|mc NUMBER] Show processes. If no arguments, defaults  to
              cm.  If followed by a number, shows that number of processes for
              each type (default: 5; if in IRC, max: 5)

              Make sure that there is no space  between  letters  and  numbers
              (e.g. write as -t cm10).

       -t c   -  CPU only. With -x, also shows memory for that process on same
              line.

       -t m   - memory only. With -x, also shows CPU for that process on  same
              line.   If  the -I or -m lines are not triggered, will also show
              the system RAM used/total information.

              See -m for explanation of System RAM: fields and values.

       -t cm  - CPU+memory. With -x, shows also CPU or memory for that process
              on same line.

       -u , --uuid
              Show  UUIDs.  Use  with  -j,  -M  -o,  -p, and -P to show parti-
              tion/system board (not common) UUIDs. Requires one of those  op-
              tions.

              Sample: -opju.

       -U , --update
              Note - Maintainer may have disabled this function.

              If inxi -h has no listing for -U then it's disabled.

              Auto-update  inxi  or pinxi. Note: if you installed as root, you
              must be root to update, otherwise user is fine. Also installs  /
              updates  current  man  page  to:  /usr/local/share/man/man1  (if
              /usr/local/share/man/ exists AND there is no inxi  man  page  in
              /usr/share/man/man1,  otherwise it goes to /usr/share/man/man1).
              This requires that you be root to write to that  directory.  See
              --man or --no-man to force or disable man install.

              -U accepts the following options (inxi and pinxi):

              No arg - Get from main git branch.

              3  -  Get the dev server (smxi.org) version. Be aware that pinxi
              when taken from here can be very unstable during active develop-
              ment! The inxi version is the stable master branch version. Also
              useful to update if you have SSL issues and --no-ssl works.

              4 - Get the dev server (smxi.org) FTP version (same  as  3  ver-
              sion). Use if SSL issues and --no-ssl doesn't work. For very old
              systems with SSL 1, you will probably need to use  this  option,
              which  bypasses  HTTP  downloading, and uses straight FTP to get
              the file from smxi.org server.

              [http|https|ftp] - Get a version of  $self_name  from  your  own
              server. Use the full download path, e.g.

              inxi -U https://myserver.com/inxi

              For  failed  downloads, use the debug option --dbg 1 in addition
              to get more verbose failure reports.

       --usb
              See -J.

       -v , --verbosity
              Report verbosity levels. If no verbosity level number is  given,
              0 is assumed.  Should not be used with -b or -e since the option
              that triggers the most  features  will  override  the  one  with
              fewer.

              Supported levels: 0-8

              Can be used together with other options.

              Examples:  inxi  -v 4  or inxi -v4 or inxi --verbosity 4 or inxi
              -zv8

       -v 0   - Simple report. Same as: inxi (with no options).

       -v 1   - Basic report: System (-S); basic  CPU  (cores,  type,  average
              clock  speed,  and min/max speeds, if available); Graphics (-G);
              basic Disk; Info (-I).

       -v 2   - Adds: Machine (-M); Battery (-B)  (if  available);  Networking
              devices (-N). Same as inxi -b.

       -v 3   -  Adds: full CPU (-C); advanced network (-n); triggers -x extra
              data option.

       -v 4   - Adds: full Drive (-D); system Partitions (-P) (if present):  /
              /home /var/ /boot.

       -v 5   -  Adds:  memory/RAM (-m); audio device (-A); bluetooth (-E) (if
              present); RAID data (-R) (if present); partition label (-l)  and
              UUID (-u); swap (-j); sensors (-s),

       -v 6   - Adds: full mounted partitions (-p); unmounted partitions (-o);
              optical drives (-d); USB (-J); triggers -xx extra data option.

       -v 7   - Adds: full CPU flags/features (-f); advanced network IP  (-i);
              triggers  -xxx; forces battery (-B), bluetooth (-E), Logical de-
              vices (-L) and RAID (-R) regardless whether data was  found  for
              them or not.

       -v 8   -  Adds:  PCI  slots (--slots); GPU advanced EDID data (--edid);
              Repos (-r); Processes (-tcm); triggers  -a  admin  data  option.
              This is all the available system data.

       --version, --vf
              inxi  full  version  and license information. Prints information
              then exits.

       --version-short, --vs
              inxi single line version information. Prints information if  not
              short form (which shows version info already). Does not exit un-
              less used without any other options. Can  be  used  with  normal
              line options, and prints version info line as first line of out-
              put.

       -w , --weather [location]
              DO NOT USE THIS FEATURE FOR AUTOMATED WEATHER UPDATES! Automated
              or  excessive  use will lead to your being blocked from any fur-
              ther access. This feature is not meant for widget  type  weather
              monitoring,  or  Conky type use. It is meant to get weather when
              you need to see it, for example, on a remote server. If you  did
              not  type  the weather option in manually, it's an automated re-
              quest.

              Adds weather line for your current location (by IP  address)  if
              no location requested. To get weather for an alternate location,
              add [location]. See also -x, -xx, -xxx options. Please note that
              your  distribution's  maintainer  may chose to disable this fea-
              ture.

              With optional [location] - get weather/time for an alternate lo-
              cation.  Accepts postal/zip code[, country], city,state pair, or
              latitude,longitude.  Note:  city/country/state  names  must  not
              contain  spaces.  Replace  spaces with the '+' sign. Don't place
              spaces around any commas. Postal code is not reliable except for
              North  America and maybe the UK. Try postal codes with and with-
              out country code added. Note that  City,State  applies  only  to
              USA, otherwise it's City,Country. If country name (english) does
              not work, try 2 character country code (e.g.  Spain:  es;  Great
              Britain: gb).

              See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2 for current
              2 letter country codes.

              Use only ASCII letters in city/state/country names.

              Examples:  -w  OR  -w   95623,us   OR   -w   Boston,MA   OR   -w
              45.5234,-122.6762 OR -w new+york,ny OR -w bodo,norway.

       --weather-source, --ws [source-id]
              [1-9]  Switches  weather  data  source. Possible values are 1-9.
              1-4 will generally be active, and 5-9 may or may not be  active,
              so  check.  1  may  not support city / country names with spaces
              (even if you use the + sign instead of space). 2  offers  pretty
              good  data,  but  may not have all small city names for -w loca-
              tion.

              Please note that the data sources are not static per value,  and
              can  change  any  time,  or be removed, so always test to verify
              which source is being used for each value if that  is  important
              to  you.  Data  sources may be added or removed on occasions, so
              try each one and see which you prefer. If  you  get  unsupported
              source message, it means that number has not been implemented.

       --weather-unit, --wu [unit]
              [m|i|mi|im] Sets weather units to metric (m), imperial (i), met-
              ric (imperial) (mi, default), imperial (metric) (im). If  metric
              or imperial not found,sets to default value, or N/A.

FILTER OPTIONS
       The  following options allow for applying various types of filtering to
       the output.

       --filter , --filter-override
              See -z, -Z.

       --filter-label, --filter-uuid, --filter-vulnerabilities
              See --zl, --zu, --zv.

       --host Turns on hostname in System line.  Overrides  inxi  config  file
              value (if set):

              SHOW_HOST='false' - Same as: SHOW_HOST='true'

              This  is an absolute override, the host will always show no mat-
              ter what other switches you use.

       --no-host
              Turns off hostname in System line. This is  default  when  using
              -z,  for  anonymizing  inxi report for posting on forums or IRC.
              Overrides configuration value (if set):

              SHOW_HOST='true' - Same as: SHOW_HOST='false'

              This is an absolute override, the host will not show  no  matter
              what other switches you use.

       -z, --filter
              Adds security filters for IP addresses, serial numbers, MAC, lo-
              cation (-w), and user home directory name. Removes Host:. On  by
              default for IRC clients.

       --za, --filter-all
              Shortcut  to trigger -z, --zl, --zu, --zv. All the filters, that
              is.

       --zl, --filter-label
              Filter partition label names  from  -j,  -o,  -p,  -P,  and  -Sa
              (root=LABEL=...).  Generally  only  useful  in  very specialized
              cases.

       --zu, --filter-uuid
              Filter partition UUIDs from -j, -o, -p, -P, -Sa (root=UUID=...),
              -Mxxx board UUID. Useful in specialized cases.

       --zv, --filter-v, --filter-vulnerabilities
              Filter Vulnerabilities report from -Ca. Generally only useful in
              very specialized cases.

       -Z , --filter-override , --no-filter
              Absolute override for output filters. Useful for debugging  net-
              working issues in IRC for example.

OUTPUT CONTROL OPTIONS
       The following options allow for modifying the output in various ways.

       -c , --color [0-42]
              Set color scheme. If no scheme number is supplied, 0 is assumed.

       -c  [94-99]
              These  color selectors run a color selector option prior to inxi
              starting which lets you set the config file value for the selec-
              tion.

              NOTE:  All  configuration file set color values are removed when
              output is piped or redirected. You must use the explicit runtime
              -c  [color  number] option if you want color codes to be present
              in the piped/redirected output.

              Color selectors for each type display (NOTE: IRC and global only
              show safe color set):

       -c 94  - Console, out of X.

       -c 95  - Terminal, running in X - like xTerm.

       -c 96  - GUI IRC, running in X - like XChat, Quassel, Konversation etc.

       -c 97  - Console IRC running in X - like irssi in xTerm.

       -c 98  - Console IRC not in X.

       -c 99  - Global - Overrides/removes all settings.

              Setting  a  specific  color type removes the global color selec-
              tion.

       --export [json|screen|xml]
              See --output.

       --indent [11-xx]
              Change primary wide indent width. Generally  useless.  Only  ap-
              plied  if  output  width  is  greater  than  max wrap width (see
              --max-wrap). Use configuration item INDENT to make permanent.

       --indents [0-10]
              Change primary wrap mode, second, and -y1 level  indents.  First
              indent  level only applied if output width is less than max wrap
              width (see --max-wrap). 0 disables all wrapped indents  and  all
              second  level  indents.  Use  configuration item INDENTS to make
              permanent.

       --max-wrap, --wrap-max [integer]
              Overrides default or configuration set line starter  wrap  width
              value.  Wrap  max  is the maximum width that inxi will wrap line
              starters (e.g. Info:) to their own lines, with  data  lines  in-
              dented default 2 columns (use --indents to change).

              If  terminal/console  width  or --width is less than wrap width,
              wrapping of line starter occurs. If 80 or less, no wrapping will
              occur.  Overrides internal default value (110) and user configu-
              ration value MAX_WRAP.

       --output,  --export [json|screen|xml]
              Change data output type. Requires --output-file if not screen.

              See this page https://smxi.org/docs/inxi-json-xml-output.htm BE-
              FORE  you post an issue about not understanding, or being unable
              to use, the output format! That gives a fairly complete explana-
              tion  of  what  the output means, and how to work with it. It is
              not a tutorial, and it will not teach you  to  program,  if  you
              don't  know  how to work with json/xml structures using a proper
              language, then this feature is not meant for you.

       --output-file,  --export-file [full path to output file|print]
              The given directory path must exist. The  directory  path  given
              must  exist,  The  print options prints to stdout.  Required for
              non-screen --output formats (json|xml).

       --separator, --sep [character(s)]
              Change the default report key: value separator  :  to  something
              else. Make permanent with configuration item SEP2_CONSOLE.

       --wrap-max [integer]
              See --max-wrap.

       -y, --width [integer]
              This  is  an  absolute width override which sets the output line
              width   max.    Overrides   COLS_MAX_IRC,   COLS_MAX_NO_DISPLAY,
              COLS_MAX_CONSOLE  configuration  items,  or the actual widths of
              the terminal.

              * -y - sets default width of 80 columns.
              * -y [60-xxx] - sets width to given number. Must be 60 or more.
              * -y 1 -  switches to a single indented key/value pair per line,
              and  removes  all  long line wrapping (similar to dmidecode out-
              put). Not recommended for use with -Y;
              * -y -1 - removes width limits  (if  assigned  by  configuration
              items).

              Examples:
              inxi -exx -y 130
              inxi -exxy
              inxi -bay1

       -Y, --height, --less [-3-[integer]
              Control  output  height.  Useful when in console, and scrollback
              not available.  Breaks output flow based on values provided.

              * -Y 0 or -Y - Set default max height to terminal height.
              * -Y [1-xxx] - set max output block height height in lines.
              * -Y -1 - Print out one primary data item block (like CPU:, Sys-
              tem:)  at  a  time.  Useful for very long outputs like -ea, -v8,
              etc. Not available for -h.
              * -Y -2 - Do not disable output colors when redirected or  piped
              to another program. Useful if piping output to less -R for exam-
              ple. This does not limit the height otherwise since the expecta-
              tion  it  is being piped to another program like less which will
              handle that.
              * -Y -3 - Restore default unlimited output  lines  if  LINES_MAX
              configuration item set.

              Recommended  to  use  the  following  for very clean up and down
              scrollable output out of  display,  while  retaining  the  color
              schemes, which are normally removed with piping or redirect:

              pinxi -v8Y -2 | less -R

              Note:  since  it's not possible for inxi to know how many actual
              terminal lines are being used by terminal wrapped  output,  with
              -y 1 , it may be better in general to use a fixed height like:

              -y 1 -Y 20 instead of: -y 1 -Y

EXTRA DATA OPTIONS
       These  options  can be triggered by one or more -x.  Alternatively, the
       -v options trigger them in the following way: -v 3 adds -x; -v  6  adds
       -xx; -v 7 adds -xxx

       These  extra data triggers can be useful for getting more in-depth data
       on various options. They can be added to any  long  form  option  list,
       e.g.: -bxx or -Sxxx

       There are 3 extra data levels:
       -x, -xx, -xxx
       OR
       --extra 1, --extra 2, --extra 3

       The  following  details show which lines / items display extra informa-
       tion for each extra data level.

       -x -A  - Adds (if available and/or relevant) vendor: item, which  shows
              specific vendor [product] information.

              -  Adds  version/port(s)/driver  version (if available) for each
              device.

              - Adds PCI/USB ID of each device.

              - Adds inactive sound servers/APIs, if detected.

       -x -B  - Adds vendor/model, battery status (if battery present).

              - Adds attached battery powered  peripherals  (Device-[number]:)
              if detected (keyboard, mouse, etc.).

              - Adds battery volts:, min: voltages. Note that if difference is
              critical, that is current voltage is too close to minimum  volt-
              age, shows without -x.

       -x -C  - Adds bogomips to CPU speed report (if available).

              -  Adds L1: and L3: cache types if either are present/available.
              For BSD or legacy Linux, uses dmidecode + doas/sudo/root.  Force
              use  of  dmidecode cache values by adding --dmidecode. This will
              override /sys based cache data, which tends to be better, so  in
              general don't do that.

              - Adds boost: [enabled|disabled] if detected, aka turbo. Not all
              CPUs have this feature.

              - Adds CPU Flags (short list). Use -f to see  full  flag/feature
              list.

              -  Adds CPU microarchitecture + revision (e.g. Sandy Bridge, K8,
              ARMv8, P6, etc.). Only shows data if detected. Newer microarchi-
              tectures  will  have to be added as they appear, and require the
              CPU family ID, model ID, and stepping.

              - Adds, if smt (Simultaneous MultiThreading)  is  available  but
              disabled,  after  type:  data smt: disabled. type: MT means it's
              enabled. See -Cxxx.

              Examples:
              arch: Sandy Bridge rev: 2
              arch: K8 rev.F+ rev: 2

              If unable to non-ambiguosly determine  architecture,  will  show
              something like: arch: Amber Lake note: check rev: 9

              -  Adds  CPU  highest  speed after avg: [speed] high: [speed] if
              greater than 1 core and cores have different speeds. Linux only.

       -x -d  - Adds more items to Features line of  optical  drive;  dds  rev
              version to optical drive.

       -x -D  - Adds drive temperature with disk data.

              Method  1:  Systems  running Linux kernels ~5.6 and newer should
              have drivetemp module data available. If so,  drive  temps  will
              come from /sys data for each drive, and will not require root or
              hddtemp. This method is MUCH faster  than  using  hddtemp.  Note
              that NVMe drives do not require drivetemp.

              If your drivetemp module is not enabled, enable it:

              modprobe drivetemp

              Once   enabled,  add  drivetemp  to  /etc/modules  or  /etc/mod-
              ules-load.d/***.conf so it starts automatically.

              If you see drive temps running as regular user and you  did  not
              configure system to use doas/sudo hddtemp, then your system sup-
              ports this feature. If no /sys data is found, inxi will  try  to
              use  hddtemp  methods  instead for that drive.  Hint: if temp is
              /sys sourced, the temp will be to 1 decimal, like 34.8,  if  hd-
              dtemp sourced, they will be integers.

              Method  2:  if you have hddtemp installed, if you are root or if
              you have added to /etc/sudoers (sudo v. 1.7 or newer):

              <username> ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/hddtemp (sample)

              doas users: see man doas.conf for setup.

              You can force use of hddtemp for all drives using --hddtemp.

              - If free LVM volume group size detected (root  required),  show
              lvm-free:  on  Local Storage line. This is how much unused space
              the VGs contain, that is, space not assigned to LVs.

       -x -E (--bluetooth)
              - Adds (if available and/or relevant) vendor: item, which  shows
              specific vendor [product] information.

              - Adds PCI/USB Bus ID of each device.

              - Adds driver version (if available) for each device.

              - Adds (if available, btmgmt, hciconfig only) LMP (HCI if no LMP
              data, and HCI if HCI/LMP versions  are  different)  version  (if
              available) for each HCI ID.

       -x -G  -  Adds  GPU  micro-architecture  (if  AMD/Intel/Nvidia  and de-
              tected).

              - Adds PCI/USB ID of each device.

              - Adds (if available and/or relevant) vendor: item, which  shows
              specific vendor [product] information.

              - X.org: Adds (for single GPU, nvidia driver) screen number that
              GPU is running on.

              - Adds device temperature for each discrete device (Linux only).

              - For EGL, adds active/inactive platform report.

              - For OpenGL (X.org only) adds direct render  status,  GLX  ver-
              sion.

              - For Vulkan, adds device count.

       -x -i  - Adds IP v6 additional scope data, like Global, Site, Temporary
              for each interface.

              Note that there is no way we are aware of to filter out the dep-
              recated  IP  v6  scope  site/global temporary addresses from the
              output of ifconfig. The ip tool shows that clearly.

              ip-v6-temporary - (ip tool only), scope global temporary.  Scope
              global temporary deprecated is not shown

              ip-v6-global  -  scope  global  (ifconfig will show this for all
              types, global, global temporary,  and  global  temporary  depre-
              cated, ip shows it only for global)

              ip-v6-link - scope link (ip/ifconfig) - default for -i.

              ip-v6-site  - scope site (ip/ifconfig). This has been deprecated
              in IPv6, but still exists. ifconfig may show multiple site  val-
              ues, as with global temporary, and global temporary deprecated.

              ip-v6-unknown - unknown scope

       -x -I  -  Adds  current  init  system  (and init rc in some cases, like
              OpenRC).  With -xx, shows init/rc version number, if available.

              - Adds default system compilers. With -xx, also show  other  in-
              stalled compiler versions.

              - Adds current runlevel/target (not available with all init sys-
              tems).

              - Adds total packages discovered in system. See -xx and  -a  for
              per package manager type reports. Moves to Repos if -rx.

              If  your  package manager is not supported, please file an issue
              and we'll add it.  That requires the full output of the query or
              method  to  discover  all  installed packages on your system, as
              well of course as the command or method used to discover those.

              - If in shell (i.e. not in IRC client), adds shell version  num-
              ber, if available.

       -x -j (--swap)
              Add mapper:. See -x -o.

       -x -J (--usb)
              - For Devices, adds driver(s).

              -  Adds,  if  available,  USB speed in base 10 bits/s (Si) units
              Mb/s or Gb/s (may be incorrect on BSDs due to non reliable  data
              source).  These  are  base  10 bits per second. This unit corre-
              sponds to the standard units the USB consortium uses to indicate
              speeds,  but  not to how most of the rest of your system reports
              sizes. Use -Jxx to add base 2 IEC Byte/second speeds.

       -x -L (--logical)
              - Adds dm: dm-x to VG > LV and other Device types. This can help
              tracking down which device belongs to what.

       -x -m, --memory-modules
              -  If present, adds maximum memory module/device size in the Ar-
              ray line.  Only some systems  will  have  this  data  available.
              Shows estimate if it can generate one.

       -x -N  -  Adds (if available and/or relevant) vendor: item, which shows
              specific vendor [product] information.

              - Adds version/port(s)/driver version (if  available)  for  each
              device;

              - Adds PCI/USB ID of each device.

              - Adds device temperature for each discrete device (Linux only).

       -x -o, -x -p, -x -P
              -  Adds mapper: (the /dev/mapper/ partition ID) if mapped parti-
              tion.

              Example: ID-4: /home ... dev: /dev/dm-6 mapped: ar0-home

       -x -r  - Adds Package info. See -Ix

       -x -R  - md-raid: Adds second RAID Info line with extra  data:  blocks,
              chunk  size,  bitmap  (if  present).  Resync  line, shows blocks
              synced/total blocks.

              - Hardware RAID: Adds driver version, Bus ID.

       -x -s  - Adds basic voltages: 12v, 5v, 3.3v, vbat (ipmi,  lm-sensors  /
              /sys/class/hwmon if present).

       -x -S  - Adds Kernel compiler version.

              -  Adds  to  Distro: base: if detected. System base will only be
              seen on a subset of distributions. The distro must be  both  de-
              rived  from a parent distro (e.g. Mint from Ubuntu), and explic-
              itly added to the supported distributions for this feature.  Due
              to  the  complexity  of  distribution identification, these will
              only be added as relatively solid methods  are  found  for  each
              distribution system base detection.

       -x --slots
              - Adds slot bus-ID:, if found.

       -x -t (--processes)
              -  Adds  memory use report to CPU (-xt c), and CPU use to memory
              (-xt m).

       -x -w  - Adds humidity and barometric pressure.

              - Adds wind speed and direction.

       -xx -A - Adds vendor:product ID for each device.

              - Adds PCIe speed and lanes item (Linux only, if detected).

              - Adds for USB devices USB rev, speed, lanes (lanes Linux only).

              - Adds with: [item] status: [state/plugin] helper  daemons/plug-
              ins for the sound API/server.

       -xx -B - Adds current power use, in watts.

              - Adds serial number.

       -xx -D - Adds HDD/SSD drive serial number.

              -  Adds  drive speed (if available). This is the theoretical top
              speed of the device as reported. This speed may be restricted by
              system  board  limits,  eg. a SATA 3 drive on a SATA 2 board may
              report SATA 2 speeds, but this  is  not  completely  consistent,
              sometimes  a  SATA 3 device on a SATA 2 board reports its design
              speed.

              NVMe drives: adds lanes, and (per direction) speed is calculated
              with  lane speed * lanes * PCIe overhead. PCIe 1 and 2 have data
              rates of GT/s * .8 = Gb/s (10 bits required to transfer  8  bits
              of  data).  PCIe 3 and greater transfer data at a rate of GT/s *
              128/130 * lanes = Gb/s (130 bits required to transfer  128  bits
              of data).

              For a PCIe 3 NVMe drive, with speed of 8 GT/s and 4 lanes (8GT/s
              * 128/130 * 4 = 31.6 Gb/s):

              speed: 31.6 Gb/s lanes: 4

              - Adds HDD/SSD drive duid, if available. Some BSDs have it.

              - Adds for USB drives USB rev, speed, lanes (lanes Linux only).

       -xx -E (--bluetooth)
              - Adds vendor:product ID of each device.

              - Adds PCIe speed and lanes item (Linux only, and if PCIe  blue-
              tooth, which is rare).

              - Adds for USB devices USB rev, speed, lanes (lanes Linux only).

              -  Adds  (hciconfig only) LMP subversion (and/or HCI revision if
              applicable) for each device.

       -xx -G Triggers much more complete Screen/Monitor report.

              X.org: requires xdpyinfo or xrandr, and the advanced per monitor
              feature requires xrandr.

              Wayland:  requires any tool capable of showing monitor and reso-
              lution  information.  Sway  has  swaymsg,  weston-info  or  way-
              land-info  can  show Wayland information on any Wayland composi-
              tor, and wlr-randr can show Wayland information for any  wlroots
              based compositor.

              Further note that all references to Displays, Screens, and Moni-
              tors are referring to the X or Wayland technical terms, not nor-
              mal consumer usage.

              X.org:  1 Display runs 1 or more Screens, and 1 Screen runs 1 or
              more Monitors.

              Wayland: The Display is the primary container, and it  can  con-
              tain 1 or more Monitors.

              - Adds vendor:product ID of each device.

              - Adds PCIe speed and lanes item (Linux only, and if PCIe device
              and detected).

              - Adds for USB devices USB rev, speed, lanes (lanes Linux only).

              - Adds output port IDs, active,  off  (connected  but  disabled,
              like a closed laptop lid) and empty. Example:

              ports: active: DVI-I-1,VGA-1 empty: HDMI-A-1

              -  Adds  Display  ID. X.org: the Display running the Screen that
              runs the Monitors; Wayland: the Display that runs the monitors.

              - Adds compositor, if found (always shows for Wayland).

              - Wayland: Adds to  Display d-rect: if > 1 monitors in  Display.
              This is the size of the rectangle Wayland creates to situate the
              monitors in.

              - X.org: If available, shows alternate: Xorg drivers. This means
              a  driver  on  the  default  list  of drivers Xorg automatically
              checks for the device, but which is not installed. For  example,
              if you have nouveau driver, nvidia would show as alternate if it
              was not installed. Note that alternate: does NOT mean you should
              have  it,  it's just one of the drivers Xorg checks to see if is
              present and loaded when checking the device. This  can  let  you
              know  there  are other driver options. Note that if you have ex-
              plicitly set the driver in xorg.conf, Xorg will not create  this
              automatic check driver list.

              - Xorg: Adds total number of Screens listed for the current Dis-
              play.

              - Xorg: Adds default Screen ID if Screen (not monitor!) total is
              greater than 1.

              -  X.org:  Adds  Screen  line, which includes the ID (Screen: 0)
              then s-res (Screen resolution), s-dpi. Remember, this is an Xorg
              Screen,  NOT  a  monitor  screen,  and the information listed is
              about the Xorg Screen! It may at times be the same as  a  single
              monitor  system,  but  usually it's different in some ways. Note
              that the physical monitor dpi and the Xorg dpi are not necessar-
              ily the same thing, and can vary widely.

              -  Adds Monitor lines. Monitors are a subset of a Screen (X.org)
              or Display (Wayland), each of which can have one or  more  moni-
              tors.  Normally  a  dual  monitor setup is 2 monitors run by one
              Xorg Screen/Wayland Display.

              - res: is the current monitor mode,  along  with  the  frequency
              hz:.

              -  pos:  [primary,]{position  string|row-col}  (X.org:  requires
              xrandr; Wayland: requires  swaymsg  [sway],  wlr-randr  [wlroots
              based  compositors], weston-info / wayland-info [all]). Uses ei-
              ther explicit primary value or +0+0 position if no primary moni-
              tor value set.  pos: does not show for single monitor setups, or
              if no position data was found.

              Position is text (left, center, center-l, center-r, right,  top,
              top-left,  top-center,  top-right,  middle,  middle-c, middle-r,
              bottom, bottom-l, bottom-c, bottom-r) if monitors fit within the
              following grids: 1x2, 1x3, 1x4, 2x1, 2x2, 2x3, 3x1, 3x2, 3x3. If
              layout not supported in text, uses [row-nu]-[column-nu]  instead
              to indicate the monitor's position in its grid.

              The  position  is based on the upper left corner of each monitor
              relative to the grid of monitors that the Xorg  Screen  is  com-
              posed of.

              -  diag:  monitor screen diagonal in mm (inches). Note that this
              is the real monitor size, not  the  Xorg  full  Screen  diagonal
              size, which can be quite different.

              - For EGL, shows platform by specific platforms, with driver and
              egl version if different from the main one.

              - For OpenGL, adds ES version (es-v) if available. If  the  Dis-
              play  line  did  not  find an X11 display ID, the ID (e.g. :0.0)
              will show here instead.

              - For OpenGL, Vulkan, adds device-ID, if available.

              - For Vulkan, adds per  Device  ID  report  (type,  driver,  de-
              vice-ID).

       -xx -I -  Addes  Power: parent for power data children uptime: and adds
              wakeups:. Wakeups shows how many times the machine has been  wo-
              ken  from  suspend state during current uptime period (if avail-
              able, Linux only). 0 value means the machine has not  been  sus-
              pended.

              - Adds init type version number (and rc if present).

              - Adds alternate (alt:) detected installed compiler versions (if
              present).

              - Adds system default  runlevel/target,  if  detected.  Supports
              Systemd / Upstart /SysVinit type defaults.

              -  Shows  Packages:  counts  by discovered package manager types
              (pm:).  In cases where only 1 pm had results, does not show  to-
              tal  after  Packages:.  Does not show installed package managers
              with 0 packages. See -a for full report. Moves to Repos if -rxx.

              - Adds parent program (or pty/tty) that started  shell,  if  not
              IRC client.

       -xx -j (--swap), -xx -p, -xx -P
              -  Adds  swap priority to each swap partition (for -P) used, and
              for all swap types (for -j).

       -xx -J (--usb)
              - Adds vendor:chip id.

              - Adds USB lanes. Uses tx (transmit) lane count for total unless
              rx  and  tx counts are different (eg: lanes: rx: 2 tx: 4). Linux
              only.  See -Ja for sample report.

       -xx -L (--logical)
              - Adds internal LVM Logical volumes, like raid  image  and  meta
              data volumes.

              - Adds full list of Components, sub-components, and their physi-
              cal devices.

              - For LVM RAID, adds a RAID report line (if not -R). Read up  on
              LVM  documentation  to  better  understand their use of the term
              'stripes'.

       -xx -m, --memory-modules
              - Adds memory device Manufacturer.

              - Adds memory device Part Number (part-no:). Useful for ordering
              new  or  replacement memory sticks etc. Part numbers are unique,
              particularly if you use the word memory in the search  as  well.
              With -xxx, also shows serial number.

              -  Adds  single/double bank memory, if data is found. Note, this
              may not be 100% right all of the time since it  depends  on  the
              order that data is found in dmidecode output for type 6 and type
              17.

              - Adds, if present, memory array voltage. Only some legacy  sys-
              tems will have this data available.

              -  Adds  memory  module current configured operating voltage, if
              available.

       -xx -M - Adds chassis information, if data  is  available.  Also  shows
              BIOS ROM size if using dmidecode.

              -  Adds  board  part number (part-nu:) if available. This is not
              commonly found.

       -xx -N - Adds vendor:product ID for each device.

              - Adds PCIe speed and lanes item (Linux only, and if PCIe device
              and detected).

              - Adds for USB devices USB rev, speed, lanes (lanes Linux only).

       -xx -r - Adds to Packages: info. See -Ixx

       -xx -R -  md-raid:  Adds  superblock  (if  present)  and  algorithm. If
              resync, shows progress bar.

              - Hardware RAID: Adds Chip vendor:product ID.

       -xx -s - Adds DIMM/SOC voltages, if present (ipmi only).

       -xx -S

              - Adds  desktop  toolkit  (tk:),  if  available  (Xfce/KDE/Trin-
              ity/Gnome etc).

              - Adds, if run in X, window manager (wm:), if available. Not all
              window managers are supported. File issue to request  a  missing
              one.  Some  desktops support using more than one window manager,
              so this can be useful to see what  window  manager  is  actually
              running.  If  none  found,  shows  nothing. Uses a less accurate
              fallback tool wmctrl if ps tests fail to find data.

              - Adds display/login manager (dm:/lm:),  if  present.  If  none,
              shows N/A. Supports most known display/login managers, including
              elogind, entrance, gdm,  gdm3,  greetd,  kdm,  lemurs,  lightdm,
              lxdm, ly, mdm, mlogind, nodm, sddm, seatd, slim, slimski,  tint,
              wdm, xdm, and several others, added as discovered.

       -xx --slots
              - Adds slot length.

              - Adds slot voltage, if available.

       -xx -w - Adds wind chill, heat index, and dew point, if available.

              - Adds cloud cover, rain, snow, or precipitation (amount in pre-
              vious hour to observation time), if available.

       -xxx -A
              - Adds, if present, serial number.

              - Adds, if present, PCI/USB class ID.

       -xxx -B
              -  Adds battery chemistry (e.g. Li-ion), cycles (NOTE: there ap-
              pears to be a problem with the Linux kernel obtaining the  cycle
              count,  so  this almost always shows 0. There's nothing that can
              be done about this glitch, the data is simply not  available  as
              of  2018-04-03), location (only available from dmidecode derived
              output).

              - Adds attached device rechargeable: [yes|no] information.

       -xxx -C
              - Adds CPU voltage and external clock speed (this is the mother-
              board speed).  Requires doas/sudo/root and dmidecode.

              -  Adds, if smt (Simultaneous MultiThreading) data is available,
              after type: data smt: [status].
              smt: [status]
              MT in type: will show if smt is enabled in general. 3 values are
              possible:  [enabled|disabled|<unsupported>]. <unsupported> means
              the CPU does not support SMT.

       -xxx -D
              - Adds HDD/SSD drive firmware revision number (if available).

              - Adds drive partition scheme (in most cases), e.g. scheme: GPT.
              Currently  not  able to detect all schemes, but handles the most
              common, e.g.  GPT or MBR.

              - Adds drive tech (HDD/SSD), rotation speed (in some but not all
              cases),  e.g.  tech: HDD rpm: 7200, or tech: SSD if positive SSD
              identification was made. If no HDD, rotation, or positive SSD ID
              found,  shows tech: N/A. Not all HDD spinning disks report their
              speed, so even if they are spinning, no rpm data will show.

       -xxx -E (--bluetooth)
              - Adds, if present, PCI/USB class ID.

              - Adds, if present, bluetooth device class ID.

              - Adds (hciconfig only) HCI version, revision.

       -xxx -G
              - Adds, if present, Device PCI/USB class ID.

              - Adds to Device serial: number (if found).

              - Xorg: Adds to Screen: s-size: and s-diag:. (Screen  size  data
              requires xdpyinfo). This is the X.org Screen dimensions, NOT the
              Monitor size!

              - Expands monitor res: to current mode:,  hz:,  scale:,  and  if
              scale != 1, scaled to: resolution.

              -   Adds   to  Monitors  (if  detected)  size  (size:  277x156mm
              (10.9x6.1")). Note that this is the real physical monitor  size,
              not  the  Xorg  Screen/Wayland  Display size, which can be quite
              different (1 Xorg Screen / Wayland Display can for instance con-
              tain two or more monitors).

              - Adds to Monitors modes: min: max: (if detected). These are the
              smallest and largest  monitor  modes  found,  using  an  inexact
              method, so might not always be right.

              - Adds to Monitors serial: number (if detected).

              -  For  EGL,  shows hardware based driver(s) (hw:), with the re-
              lated hardware, like AMD or Intel.

              - For Vulkan, adds layer count, per device driver hardware  ven-
              dor (not displayed if device name is present with -a).

       -xxx -I
              -  For  Power:  adds supported system power states:, active sus-
              pend:  type,  active  hibernate:  type.   See   https://www.ker-
              nel.org/doc/html/v4.15/admin-guide/pm/sleep-states.html for full
              explanation of states and actions.

              - For Shell: adds (su|sudo|login) to shell name if present.

              - For Shell: adds  default:  shell  if  different  from  running
              shell, and default shell v:, if available.

              -  For  running-in: adds (SSH) to parent, if present. SSH detec-
              tion uses the whoami test.

       -xxx -J (--usb)
              - Adds, if present, serial number for non hub devices.

              - Adds interfaces: for non hub devices.

              - Adds, if present, USB class ID.

              - Adds, if non 0, max power in mA.

       -xxx -m, --memory-modules
              - Adds memory bus width: primary bus width, and if present,  to-
              tal width. e.g.

              width (bits): data: 64 total: 72

              Note  that  total / data widths are mixed up sometimes in dmide-
              code output, so inxi will take the larger value as the total  if
              present.  Data  width usually corresponds to the CPU bits. Total
              can reflect EEC or Dual Channel widths. If no total  width  data
              is found, shows:

              width: N/A

              - Adds device type detail, e.g. type: DDR3 detail: Synchronous.

              - Adds device serial number.

              - Adds memory module current, max, and min voltages, if they are
              available and different from each other. If they are the identi-
              cal, displays same as -xxm voltage report. Use -ma to always see
              them.

       -xxx -M
              - Adds, if present, board/chassis UUID, This is  also  activated
              by --uuid.

       -xxx -N
              - Adds, if present, serial number.

              - Adds, if present, PCI/USB class ID.

       -xxx -R
              -  md-raid:  Adds  system  mdraid support types (kernel support,
              read ahead, RAID events)

              - zfs-raid: Adds portion allocated (used) by RAID array/device.

              - Hardware RAID: Adds rev, ports, and (if available and/or rele-
              vant) vendor: item, which shows specific vendor [product] infor-
              mation.

       -xxx -S
              - Adds current kernel clock source, if available (Linux only).

              - Adds (if present), window manager (wm) version number.

              - Adds, if in X,  or  with  --display,  bar/dock/menu/panel/tray
              components  (with:).  If  none  found,  shows nothing. Examples:
              cairo-dock,  docky,   gnome-panel,   lxpanel,   tint2,   trayer,
              lxqt-panel, xfce4-panel and many others.

              - Adds (if present) tools: item for all detected running screen-
              savers, screen lockers. Note that not all screen lockers run  as
              daemons/services,  some  are just programs called by other tools
              or actions.

              - Adds (if available, and in  display),  virtual  terminal  (vt)
              number.   These  are  the same as ctrl+alt+F[x] numbers usually.
              Some systems have this, some don't, it varies.

              - Adds (if present), display/login manager (dm) version number.

       -xxx -w
              - Adds location (city state country), observation  altitude  (if
              available), weather observation time (if available), sunset/sun-
              rise (if available).

ADMIN EXTRA DATA OPTIONS
       These options are triggered with --admin or -a. Admin options  are  ad-
       vanced  report  options, and are more technical, and mostly of interest
       to system administrators or other machine admins.

       The --admin option sets -xxx, and only has to be used  once.   It  will
       trigger the following features:

       -a -A  -  Adds,  if present, possible alternate: kernel modules capable
              of driving each Device-x (not including the current driver:). If
              no  non-driver  modules found, shows nothing. NOTE: just because
              it lists a module does NOT mean it is available in  the  system,
              it's  just something the kernel knows could possibly be used in-
              stead.

              - Adds PCIe generation, and, if different than running PCIe gen-
              eration,  speed  or  lanes,  link-max:  gen: speed: lanes: (only
              items different from primary shown).

              - Adds list of detected audio server tools (tools:  [tools])  to
              API/Server  lines, like alsamixer, jack_control, pactl, pavuctl,
              pw-cli, sndioctl, etc.

              - Adds for USB devices USB mode (Linux only).

       -a -C
              - Adds CPU generation, process node, and  built  years,  if  de-
              tected.  For Intel, only will show if Core generation, otherwise
              the arch value is enough. For AMD, only shows Zen generation.

              - Adds microarchitecture level: (v1,v2,v3,v4) (64 bit  Intel/AMD
              CPUs  only).  This  information is used for setting compile time
              optimization switches in for example GCC. These levels were  in-
              troduced in 2020.

              Because  this  a  CPU flag based test, and these levels when > 2
              are not always 100% based on exposed CPU flags (eg OSXSAVE), for
              > v2, adds note: check.

              - Adds CPU family, model-id, and stepping (replaces rev of -Cx).
              Format is hexadecimal (decimal) if  greater  than  9,  otherwise
              hexadecimal.

              - Adds CPU microcode. Format is hexadecimal.

              -  Adds  socket type (for motherboard CPU socket, if available).
              If results doubtful will list two socket types and note:  check.
              Requires  doas/sudo/root  and dmidecode. The item in parentheses
              may simply be a different syntax for the  same  socket,  but  in
              general, check this before trusting it.

              Sample: socket: 775 (478) note: check
              Sample: socket: AM4

              -   Adds   DMI   CPU   base  and  boost/turbo  speeds.  Requires
              doas/sudo/root and dmidecode. In some  cases,  like  with  over-
              clocking or 'turbo' or 'boost' modes, voltage and external clock
              speeds may be increased, or short term limits raised on max  CPU
              speeds. These are often not reflected in /sys based CPU min/max:
              speed results, but often are using this source.

              Samples:
              CPU not overclocked, with boost, like Ryzen:
              Speed (MHz):
                avg: 2861
                high: 3250
                min/max: 1550/3400
                boost: enabled
                base/boost: 3400/3900
              Overclocked 2900 MHz CPU, with no boost available:
              Speed (MHz):
                avg: 2345
                high: 2900
                min/max: 800/2900
                base/boost: 3350/3000
              Overclocked 3000 MHz CPU, with boosted max speed:
              Speed (MHz):
                avg: 3260
                high: 4190
                min/max: 1200/3001
                base/boost: 3000/4000

              Note that these numbers can be  confusing,  but  basically,  the
              base number is the actual normal top speed the CPU runs at with-
              out boost mode, and the boost number is the max  speed  the  CPU
              reports  itself  able  to  run  at.  The actual max speed may be
              higher than either value, or lower. The boost number appears  to
              be  hard-coded  into  the CPU DMI data, and does not seem to re-
              flect actual max speeds that overclocking or other  combinations
              of  speed  boosters  can enable, as you can see from the example
              where the CPU is running at a speed faster than the  min/max  or
              base/boost values.

              Note  that  the  normal min/max: speeds do NOT show actual over-
              clocked OR boost/turbo mode speeds, and appear to be  hard-coded
              values,  not  dynamic  real  values.  The base/boost: values are
              sometimes real, and sometimes not.  base appears in  general  to
              be real.

              -  Adds frequency scaling: governor:.. driver:.. if found/avail-
              able. Also adds scaling min/max speeds if different  from  stan-
              dard CPU min/max spees (not common).

              - Adds description of cache topology per cpu. Linux only.

              -  Creates  new Topology: line after the Info: line. Moves cache
              data to this line from Info: line.

              Topology line contains, if available and/or  relevant:  physical
              CPU  count  (cpus:);  per physical CPU dies:, clusters:, cores:;
              threads per core, if > 1 (tpc:);  how  many  threads:  (if  more
              threads  than  cores); smt status (if no smt status found, shows
              N/A).

              Not all CPUs have or report dies or clusters. Some may have dies
              but  no clusters, some clusters but no dies, some dies and clus-
              ters, and some neither dies nor clusters. This is a function  of
              how  the  CPU  topology  reports itself to the kernel. Note that
              core counts are per physical CPU, not per die or cluster.  Clus-
              ters  are per die, and in cases of > 1 dies, will show as: clus-
              ters: 2x4.

              If complex CPU type, like Alder lake, cores: will  have  a  more
              granular  breakdown of how many mt (multi-threaded) and how many
              st  (single-threaded)  cores  there  are  in  the  physical  cpu
              (mt-cores:,  st-cores:);  For complex CPU types like ARM SoC de-
              vices with 2  CPU  types,  with  different  core  counts  and/or
              min/max:)  frequencies,  variant:  per type found, with relevant
              differences shown, like cores:, min/max:, etc.

              -  Adds CPU Vulnerabilities (bugs) as known by your current ker-
              nel. Lists by Type: ... (status|mitigation):  ....  for  systems
              that  support  this  feature  (Linux  kernel  4.14  or newer, or
              patched older kernels).

       -a -d,-a -D
              - Adds logical and physical block size in bytes.

              Using smartctl (requires doas/sudo/root privileges).

              - Adds device model family, like Caviar Black, if available.

              - Adds SATA type (eg 1.0, 2.6, 3.0) if a SATA device.

              - Adds device kernel major:minor number (Linux only).

              - Adds SMART report line: status, enabled/disabled, health, pow-
              ered  on,  cycles,  and some error cases if out of range values.
              Note that for Pre-fail items, it will show the VALUE and THRESH-
              OLD  numbers. It will also fall back for unknown attributes that
              are or have been failing  and  print  out  the  Attribute  name,
              value,  threshold, and failing message. This way even for unhan-
              dled Attribute names, you should get a  solid  report  for  full
              failure  cases.  Other  cases may show if inxi believes that the
              item may be approaching failure. This is a guess so make sure to
              check the drive and smartctl full output to verify before taking
              any further action.

              - Adds, for USB or other external drives, actual model  name/se-
              rial  if  available,  and different from enclosure model/serial,
              and corrects block sizes if necessary.

              - Adds for USB drives USB mode (Linux only).

              - Adds in drive temperature for some drives as well,  and  other
              useful data.

       -a -E (--bluetooth)
              - Adds (hciconfig only) extra line to Report:, Info:.  Includes,
              if available, ACL MTU, SCO MTU, Link policy, Link mode, and Ser-
              vice Classes.

              - Adds PCIe generation, and, if different than running PCIe gen-
              eration, speed or lanes,  link-max:  gen:  speed:  lanes:  (only
              items different from primary shown. Bluetooth PCIe rare).

              - Adds for USB devices USB mode (Linux only).

              -  Adds, if present, bluetooth status: discoverable, active dis-
              coverable, and pairing items.

       -a -G  - Adds, if present, possible alternate: kernel  modules  capable
              of driving each Device-x (not including the current loaded:). If
              no non-driver modules found, shows nothing. NOTE:  just  because
              it  lists  a module does NOT mean it is available in the system,
              it's just something the kernel knows could possibly be used  in-
              stead.

              -  Adds  (AMD/Intel/Nvidia, if available) process: [node] built:
              [years] to arch: item.

              - Adds (if Linux and Nvidia device) non-free support information
              (if  available).  This can be useful for forum support people to
              determine if the card  supports  current  active  legacy  Nvidia
              driver branches, or if the card nonfree driver is EOL or active.
              Note that if card is current, shows basic series and status.

              Includes extended non free Nvidia legacy informatin  (Linux  and
              Nvidia  only),  and  arch: reports (AMD/Intel/Nvidia). Useful to
              help diagnose driver support issues, shows extra data  that  can
              help  diagnose/debug.  Adds code: item if found and not the same
              as arch:.

              - Adds for USB devices USB mode (Linux only).

       -a -I  -  Adds to Power: other hibernate and suspend available (avail:)
              states, hibernate suspend image: size, and if any suspend  fail-
              ures (fails:), how many.

              -  Adds power daemons/services (services:) running. Note not all
              services are daemons.

              - Adds to Packages number of lib packages detected  per  package
              manager.  Also  adds  detected  package managers with 0 packages
              listed. Adds package manager tools (supported: rpm,  dpkg,  pkg-
              tool) Moves to Repos if -ra.

              -  Adds service control tool, tested for in the following order:
              systemctl rc-service rcctl service sv /etc/rc.d /etc/init.d. Can
              be  useful  to  know which you need when using an unfamiliar ma-
              chine.

       -a -j (--swap), -a -P [swap], -a -P [swap]
              - Adds swappiness and vfs cache pressure, and a message to indi-
              cate  if  the value is the default value or not (Linux only, and
              only if available). If not  the  default  value,  shows  default
              value as well, e.g.

              For -P per swap physical partition:

              swappiness: 60 (default) cache-pressure: 90 (default 100)

              For -j row 1 report:

              Kernel:  swappiness:  60  (default)  cache-pressure: 90 (default
              100)

              - Adds zswap data for row 1 report:

              zswap: [yes/no] compressor: [type] max-pool: xx%

              - Adds for zram swap type: active  compression  type,  available
              compression types, and max compression streams.

              - Adds device kernel major:minor number (Linux only).

       -a -J (--usb)
              - Adds, if available, USB speed in IEC units MiB/s or GiB/s (may
              be incorrect on BSDs due to non reliable data source). These are
              base 2 Bytes per second.

              -  Adds  USB mode (Linux only), which is the technical terms the
              USB group uses to describe USB revisions. In cases  where  speed
              and  rev  are an unknown combination, (and probably at least one
              is wrong) shows message.

              There are no granular data sources in BSDs  for  accurate  revi-
              sion/lane/speed information, so mode cannot be determined.

       -a -L (--logical)
              -  Expands  Component report, shows size / maj-min of components
              and devices, and mapped name for logical components.  Puts  each
              component/device on its own line.

              - Adds maj-min to LV and other devices.

       -a -m  -  Expands volts to include curr/min/max values even if they are
              all identical.

              - Adds RAM module firmware version, if detected. Not common.

       -a -n, -a -N, -a -i
              - Adds, if present, possible alternate: kernel  modules  capable
              of driving each Device-x (not including the current driver:). If
              no non-driver modules found, shows nothing. NOTE:  just  because
              it  lists  a module does NOT mean it is available in the system,
              it's just something the kernel knows could possibly be used  in-
              stead.

              - Adds PCIe generation, and, if different than running PCIe gen-
              eration, speed or lanes,  link-max:  gen:  speed:  lanes:  (only
              items different from primary shown).

              - Adds for USB devices USB mode (Linux only).

              -  Adds Info: line (-n, -i only), with running network type ser-
              vices:. Note not all services are daemons. For example, Network-
              Manager can be started with --no-daemon flag.

       -a -o  - Adds device kernel major:minor number (Linux only).

       -a -p,-a -P
              -  Adds raw partition size, including file system overhead, par-
              tition table, e.g.

              raw-size: 60.00 GiB.

              - Adds percent of raw size available to size: item, e.g.

              size: 58.81 GiB (98.01%).

              Note that used: 16.44 GiB (34.3%) percent refers to  the  avail-
              able size, not the raw size.

              -  Adds  partition filesystem block size if found (requires root
              and blockdev).

              - Adds device kernel major:minor number (Linux only).

       -a -r  - Adds to Packages: report. See -Ia

       -a -R  - Adds device kernel major:minor number (mdraid, Linux only).

              - Adds, if available, component size, major:minor number  (Linux
              only). Turns Component report to 1 component per line.

       -a -S  -  Adds  alternate  kernel  clock  sources,  if available (Linux
              only).

              - Adds kernel boot parameters to Kernel section  (if  detected).
              Support varies by OS type.

              -  Adds  advanced  desktop  (info:) item, and version. Currently
              supports KDE Frameworks and version.

              - Adds other available (avail:) screensavers/lockers  in  tools:
              section. These are ones installed, but not necessarily active or
              running.

       -a --slots
              - Adds PCI children of the main slot bus ID, and their types and
              class  IDs,  recursively. Linux only, and only if detected. Sam-
              ple:

              Slot: 0
                type: PCIe
                lanes: 16
                status: in use

ADVANCED OPTIONS
       --alt 40
              Bypass  Perl  as  a  downloader  option.   Priority   is:   Perl
              (HTTP::Tiny), Curl, Wget, Fetch, (OpenBSD only) ftp.

       --alt 41
              Bypass   Curl   as   a  downloader  option.  Priority  is:  Perl
              (HTTP::Tiny), Curl, Wget, Fetch, (OpenBSD only) ftp.

       --alt 42
              Bypass  Fetch  as  a  downloader  option.  Priority   is:   Perl
              (HTTP::Tiny), Curl, Wget, Fetch, (OpenBSD only) ftp.

       --alt 43
              Bypass   Wget   as   a  downloader  option.  Priority  is:  Perl
              (HTTP::Tiny), Curl, Wget, Fetch, OpenBSD only: ftp

       --alt 44
              Bypass Curl, Fetch, and Wget as downloader options.  This  basi-
              cally   forces   the   downloader  selection  to  use  Perl  5.x
              HTTP::Tiny, which is generally slower than Curl or Wget  but  it
              may help bypass issues with downloading.

       --bt-tool [bluetoothctl|bt-adapter|btmgmt|hciconfig|rfkill]
              See --force [tool name]. Used to set -E report tool.

       --dig  Shortcut. See --force dig.

       --display [:<integer>]
              Will  try to get display data out of X (does not usually work as
              root user).  Default gets display info from display :0.  If  you
              use  the format --display :1 then it would get it from display 1
              instead, or any display you specify.

              Note that in some cases, --display will cause inxi to hang  end-
              lessly  when  running the option in console with Intel graphics.
              The situation regarding other free drivers such  as  nouveau/ATI
              is  currently unknown. It may be that this is a bug with the In-
              tel graphics driver - more information is required.

              You can test this easily by running the following command out of
              X/display server: glxinfo -display :0

              If it hangs, --display will not work.

       --dmidecode
              Shortcut. See --force dmidecode.

       --downloader [curl|fetch|perl|wget]
              Force inxi to use Curl, Fetch, Perl, or Wget for downloads.

       --egl  Shortcut. See --force egl.

       --force [option(s)]
              Various  force options to allow users to override defaults. Val-
              ues can be given as a comma separated list:

              inxi -MJ --force dmidecode,lsusb

              - bluetoothctl - Force use of bluetoothctl in -E.

              - bt-adapter - Force use of bt-adapter tool in -E.

              - btmgmt - Force use of btmgmt tool in -E.

              - colors - Do not remove colors from piped or redirected output.
              Same as -Y -2.

              - cpuinfo - Force use of cpuinfo over sys for cpu data in -C.

              -  dig  -  Temporary override of NO_DIG configuration item. Only
              use to test w/wo dig. Restores  default  behavior  for  WAN  IP,
              which is use dig if present.

              -  dmidecode  -  Force use of dmidecode. This will override /sys
              data in some lines, e.g. -M or -B.

              - egl - Force use of EGL graphics API  even  if  internal  rules
              block  it from running due to possible hanging. This is the case
              sometimes with Intel 32 bit Pentium 4 era Gen2 and  older  GPUs,
              but it's not consistent.

              - hciconfig - Force use of hciconfig tool in -E.

              -  hddtemp  - Force use of hddtemp instead of /sys temp data for
              disks.

              - html-wan - Temporary  override  of  NO_HTML_WAN  configuration
              item.  Only  use  to  test w/wo HTML downloaders for WAN IP. Re-
              stores default behavior for WAN IP, which is use HTML downloader
              if present and if dig failed.

              - ifconfig - Force use of IF tool ifconfig for -i.

              - ip - Force use of IF ip tool for -i (default).

              -  kscreen  - Wayland: Force -G monitor data source kscreen-con-
              sole.

              - lsusb - Forces the USB data generator to  use  lsusb  as  data
              source   (default).  Overrides  USB_SYS  in  user  configuration
              file(s).

              - man - Force update / install of man page with -U if  pinxi  or
              using  -U 3 dev branch. (Only active if -U is is not disabled by
              maintainers). Default is to install always for inxi, and not for
              pinxi.

              -  no-dig  - Overrides default use of dig to get WAN IP address.
              Allows use of normal downloader tool to get IP  addresses.  Only
              use  if  dig is failing, since dig is much faster and more reli-
              able in general than other methods.

              - no-doas - Skips the use of doas to run certain  internal  fea-
              tures  (like  hddtemp,  file)  with doas. Not related to running
              inxi itself with doas/sudo or super user. Some systems will reg-
              ister errors which will then trigger admin emails in such cases,
              so if you want to disable regular user use of  doas  (which  re-
              quires configuration to setup anyway for these options) just use
              this option, or NO_DOAS configuration item. See --no-sudo if you
              need to disable both types.

              -  no-egl  - Skip eglinfo sourced EGL graphics API in -G. Use if
              Graphics hangs or running a debugger data set which hangs due to
              eglinfo bug ( only found on ancient Pentium 4 w/ Gen 2 GPUs).

              - no-graphics-api -  Skip graphics API in -G.

              -  no-html-wan - Overrides use of HTML downloaders to get WAN IP
              address. Use either only dig, or do not get wan IP. Only use  if
              dig is failing, and the HTML downloaders are taking too long, or
              are hanging or failing.

              Make permanent with NO_HTML_WAN='true'

              - no-man - Disables man page install with -U for master and  ac-
              tive development branches. (Only active if -U is is not disabled
              by maintainers). No man install is default for  pinxi.  Man  in-
              stall is default for inxi.

              - no-opengl - Skip glxinfo sourced OpenGL graphics API in -G.

              -  no-ssl  -  Skip SSL certificate checks for all downloader ac-
              tions (-U, -w, -i). Use if your system does not have current SSL
              certificate  lists,  or if you have problems making a connection
              for any reason.  Works with  Wget,  Curl,  Perl  HTTP::Tiny  and
              Fetch.

              -  no-sudo  - Skips the use of sudo to run certain internal fea-
              tures (like hddtemp, file) with sudo.  Not  related  to  running
              inxi  itself  with sudo or superuser. Some systems will register
              errors which will then trigger admin emails in such cases, so if
              you  want  to  disable  regular user use of sudo (which requires
              configuration to setup anyway for these options) just  use  this
              option, or NO_SUDO configuration item.

              - no-vulkan - Skip vulkaninfo sourced Vulkan graphics API in -G.

              -  rfkill - Force use of rfkill tool in -E. rfkill does not sup-
              port mac address data.

              - rpm, pkg - Override disabled rpm package counts  on  primarily
              rpm  run  systems  due  to unacceptably slow execution times for
              this command on some systems:

              rpm -qa --nodigest --nosignature

              Even on newer rpm systems,  in  virtual  machines,  running  rpm
              package  list  query  takes  more than 0.15 seconds (compared to
              0.01 to 0.05 for dpkg, pacman, pkgtool etc) for just this single
              feature,  which is north of 10% of total execution time for inxi
              -bar. On bare metal this can hit 1 second or more in our  tests.
              Older systems have taken up to 30 seconds to run this command!

              For  systems  that  support  running  rpm along with the primary
              package  installer  (dpkg/apt,  pacman,  and  pkgtool/slackpkg),
              there  are  not going to be many rpms, if any, installed, so the
              command runs in those cases (if inxi can determine it is running
              in that type of system).

              -  sensors-sys  - Force use of /sys/class/hwmon data for sensors
              (excluding ipmi sensors, which are their own line  if  present),
              skip  lm-sensors. Generally useful for testing since sys data is
              used if no lm-sensors data was found anyway, but  if  lm-sensors
              was  installed,  and  returned  no data, it's most likely if not
              nearly certain that /sys will also not return data.

              - swaymsg -  Wayland: Force -G monitor data source swaymsg.

              - udevadm - Forces use of udevadm as data source  (currently  -m
              RAM data).

              -  usb-sys  -  Forces the USB data generator to use /sys as data
              source instead of lsusb (Linux only).

              - vmstat - Forces use of vmstat for memory data.

              - wayland - Wayland: Force use of Wayland data sources, disables
              x tools glxinfo, xrandr, xdpyinfo.

              -  wl-info  - Wayland: Force -G monitor data source wayland-info
              or weston-info.

              - wlr-randr - Wayland: Force -G monitor data source wlr-randr.

              - wmctrl - Force System item wm to use wmctrl  as  data  source,
              override default ps source.

       --no-opengl
              Shortcut. See --force no-opengl.

       --no-sensor-force
              Overrides  user  set  SENSOR_FORCE configuration value. Restores
              default behavior.

       --no-ssl
              Shortcut. See --force no-ssl.

       --no-sudo
              Shortcut. See --force no-sudo.

       --pm-type [package manager name]
              For distro package maintainers only, and only for non apt,  rpm,
              or  pacman based systems. To be used to test replacement package
              lists for recommends for that package manager.

       --rpm, --pkg
              Shortcut. See --force rpm.

       --sensors-default
              Overrides configuration values SENSORS_USE or SENSORS_EXCLUDE on
              a one time basis.

       --sensors-exclude
              Linux  only. Similar to --sensors-use except removes listed sen-
              sors from sensor data. Make permanent with SENSORS_EXCLUDE  con-
              figuration  item.  Note  that gpu, network, disk, and other spe-
              cific device monitor chips are excluded by default.

              Example: inxi -sxx --sensors-exclude k10temp-pci-00c3

       --sensors-sys
              Shortcut. See --force sensors-sys

       --sensors-use
              Linux only. Use only the (comma separated) sensor arrays for  -s
              report.   Make  permanent  with  SENSORS_USE configuration item.
              Sensor array ID value must be the exact value shown  in  lm-sen-
              sors sensors output (lm-sensors only) or use -s --dbg 18 ('main'
              =>.. section) to see the sensor ID strings used  internally.  If
              you  only want to exclude one (or more) sensors from the report,
              use --sensors-exclude.

              Can be useful if the default sensor data used  by  inxi  is  not
              from  the  right  sensor  array. Note that all other sensor data
              will be removed,  which  may  lead  to  undesired  consequences.
              Please  be aware that this can lead to many undesirable side-ef-
              fects, since default behavior is to use all the  sensors  arrays
              and  select  which  values  to use from them following a set se-
              quence of rules. So if you force one to be used,  you  may  lose
              data that was used from another one.

              Most  likely  best use is when one (or two) of the sensor arrays
              has all the sensor data you want, and you just want to make sure
              inxi  doesn't use data from another array that has inaccurate or
              misleading data.

              Note that gpu, network, disk, and other specific device  monitor
              chips  are  excluded  by  default, and should not be added since
              they do not provide cpu, board, system, etc, sensor data.

              Example:  inxi  -sxx   --sensors-use   nct6791-isa-0290,k10temp-
              pci-00c3

       --sleep [0-x.x]
              Usually  in  decimals.  Change  CPU  sleep time for -C (current:
               .35).  Sleep is used to let the system catch up and show a more
              accurate CPU use.  Example:

              inxi -Cxxx --sleep 0.15

              Overrides default internal value and user configuration value:

              CPU_SLEEP=0.25

       --tty  Forces  internal  IRC flag to off. Used in unhandled cases where
              the program running inxi may not be seen as a shell/pty/tty, but
              it  is  not  an  IRC  client.  Put --tty first in option list to
              avoid unexpected errors. If you want a  specific  output  width,
              use  the  --width  option. If you want normal color codes in the
              output, use the -c [color ID] flag.

              The sign you need to  use  this  is  extra  numbers  before  the
              key/value  pairs  of  the output of your program. These are IRC,
              not TTY, color codes. Please post a codeberg.org  issue  if  you
              find you need to use --tty (including the full -Ixxx line) so we
              can  figure  out  how  to  add  your  program  to  the  list  of
              whitelisted programs.

              You  can  see  what  inxi believed started it in the -Ixxx line,
              Shell: or Client: item. Please let us know what that result  was
              so we can add it to the parent start program whitelist.

              In some cases, you may want to also use --no-filter/-Z option if
              you want to see filtered values. Filtering is turned on  by  de-
              fault if inxi believes it is running in an IRC client.

       --usb-sys
              Shortcut. See --force usb-sys

       --usb-tool
              Shortcut. See --force lsusb

       --wan-ip-url [URL]
              Force  -i to use supplied URL as WAN IP source. Overrides dig or
              default IP source urls. URL must start with http[s] or ftp.

              The IP address from the URL must be the last item  on  the  last
              (non-empty) line of the page content source code.

              Same as configuration value (example):

              WAN_IP_URL='https://mysite.com/ip.php'

       --wayland, --wl
              Shortcut. See --force wayland.

       --wm   Shortcut. See --force wmctl.

DEBUGGING OPTIONS
       --dbg {[1-x][,[1-x]]}
              Accepts  one or more comma separated dbg specific debugging num-
              bers.

              1 - Debug downloader failures. Turns off silent/quiet  mode  for
              curl, wget, and fetch. Shows more downloader action information.
              Shows some more information for Perl downloader.

              1-xx - See codeberg.org inxi-perl/docs/inxi-values.txt for  spe-
              cific specialized debugging options. There are a lot.

       --debug [1-3]
              - On screen debugger output.

       --debug 10
              -   Basic   logging.   Check   $XDG_DATA_HOME/inxi/inxi.log   or
              $HOME/.local/share/inxi/inxi.log or $HOME/.inxi/inxi.log.

       --debug 11
              - Full file/system info logging.

       --debug 20
              Creates a tar.gz file of system data and collects the  inxi  re-
              port in a file.

              *  tree  traversal  data  file(s)  read from /proc and /sys, and
              other system data.

              * xorg conf and log data, xrandr, xprop, xdpyinfo, glxinfo etc.

              * data from dev, disks, partitions, etc.

       --debug 21
              Automatically uploads debugger data tar.gz file to ftp.smxi.org,
              then  removes  the  debug  data  directory, but leaves the debug
              tar.gz file.  See --ftp for uploading to alternate locations.

       --debug 22
              Automatically uploads debugger data tar.gz file to ftp.smxi.org,
              then  removes the debug data directory and the tar.gz file.  See
              --ftp for uploading to alternate locations.

       --debug-id [string]
              Insert string to file name for debugger. This is helpful so  you
              can add for instance a username to a debugger dataset to make it
              easy to find.

              Sample: --debug 22 --debug-id mrmazda

       --fake-data-dir
              Developer only: Change default location of $fake_data_dir, which
              is where files are for --fake {item} items.

       --ftp [ftp.yoursite.com/incoming]
              For alternate ftp upload locations: Example:

              inxi --ftp ftp.yourserver.com/incoming --debug 21

DEBUGGING OPTIONS TO DEBUG DEBUGGER FAILURES
       Only use the following in conjunction with --debug 2[012], and only use
       if you experienced a failure or hang, or were instructed to do so.

       --debug-proc
              Force debugger to parse /proc directory data when run  as  root.
              Normally  this  is  disabled  due to unpredictable data in /proc
              tree.

       --debug-proc-print
              Use this to locate file that /proc debugger hangs on.

       --debug-no-exit
              Skip exit on error when running debugger.

       --debug-no-proc
              Skip /proc debugging in case of a hang.

       --debug-no-sys
              Skip /sys debugging in case of a hang.

       --debug-sys
              Force PowerPC debugger parsing of /sys as doas/sudo/root.

       --debug-sys-print
              Use this to locate file that /sys debugger hangs on.

SUPPORTED IRC CLIENTS
       BitchX, Gaim/Pidgin, ircII, Irssi, Konversation, Kopete, KSirc,  KVIrc,
       Weechat,  and Xchat. Plus any others that are capable of displaying ei-
       ther built-in or external program output.

RUNNING IN IRC CLIENT
       To trigger inxi output in your IRC client, pick the appropriate  method
       from the list below:

       Hexchat, XChat, Irssi
              (and  many  other  IRC  clients)  /exec -o inxi [options] If you
              don't include the -o, only you will see the output on your local
              IRC client.

       Konversation
              /cmd inxi [options]

              To  run inxi in Konversation as a native program if your distri-
              bution or inxi package hasn't already done this for you,  create
              this symbolic link:

              KDE  4: ln -s /usr/local/bin/inxi /usr/share/kde4/apps/konversa-
              tion/scripts/inxi

              KDE   5:   ln   -s   /usr/local/bin/inxi    /usr/share/konversa-
              tion/scripts/inxi

              If  inxi  is  somewhere  else, change the path /usr/local/bin to
              wherever it is located.

              If you are using KDE/QT 5, then you may also  need  to  add  the
              following to get the Konversation /inxi command to work:

              ln -s /usr/share/konversation /usr/share/apps/

              Make  sure  you also have the qdbus-qt5 package (Debian/Ubuntu +
              derived), qt5-qttools (Fedora/RHEL/SUSE +  derived),   qt5-tools
              (Arch  +  derived)  installed (for KDE 5/QT 5, check distros for
              future package names), qt5-tools (Arch +  derived).  Check  your
              distro  if  the  program  is  missing.  Depending on the distro,
              /usr/lib/qt5/bin/qdbus is required, which in Debian+ is provided
              by the above package.

              Then you can start inxi directly, like this:

              /inxi [options]

       WeeChat
              NEW: /exec -o inxi [options]

              OLD: /shell -o inxi [options]

              Newer (2014 and later) WeeChats work pretty much the same now as
              other console IRC clients, with /exec -o inxi  [options].  Newer
              WeeChats  have  dropped  the -curses part of their program name,
              i.e.: weechat instead of weechat-curses.

CONFIGURATION FILE
       inxi will read its configuration/initialization files in the  following
       order:

       /etc/inxi.conf  contains the default configurations. These can be over-
       ridden by creating a /etc/inxi.conf.d/inxi.conf file (global override),
       which  will  prevent  distro packages from changing or overwriting your
       edits. This method is recommended if you are using  a  distro  packaged
       inxi  and  want  to  override  some global configuration items from the
       package's default /etc/inxi.conf file  but  don't  want  to  lose  your
       changes on a package update.

       In  case  the  distro is using either /usr/etc or /usr/local/etc as non
       core tool default location, inxi will use those paths instead, with the
       inxi.conf.d/inxi.conf override option.

       You  can  also override, per user, with a user configuration file found
       in one of the following locations (inxi will store its config file  us-
       ing the following precedence):

       if $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is not empty, it will go there, else if $HOME/.con-
       fig/inxi.conf exists, it will go there, and  as  a  last  default,  the
       legacy location is used), i.e.:

       $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/inxi.conf       >       $HOME/.config/inxi.conf      >
       $HOME/.inxi/inxi.conf          >          /usr/etc/inxi.conf          >
       /usr/etc/inxi.conf.d/inxi.conf  >  /usr/local/etc/inxi.conf  > /usr/lo-
       cal/etc/inxi.conf.d/inxi.conf    >     /etc/inxi.conf.d/inxi.conf     >
       /etc/inxi.conf

CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
       See  the documentation page for more complete information on how to set
       these up, and for a complete list of options:

       https://smxi.org/docs/inxi-configuration.htm

       Basic Options
              Here's a brief overview of the basic options you are  likely  to
              want to use:

              COLS_MAX_CONSOLE  The  max  display column width on terminal. If
              terminal/console width or --width is less than wrap width, wrap-
              ping of line starter occurs

              COLS_MAX_IRC The max display column width on IRC clients.

              COLS_MAX_NO_DISPLAY  The  max display column width in out of X /
              Wayland / desktop / window manager.

              CPU_SLEEP Decimal value 0 or more.  Default  is  usually  around
              0.35  seconds.  Time  that  inxi will 'sleep' before getting CPU
              speed data, so that it reflects actual system state.

              DOWNLOADER Sets default inxi downloader: curl, fetch, ftp, perl,
              wget.  See --recommends output for more information on download-
              ers and Perl downloaders.

              FILTER_STRING Default <filter>. Any string you prefer to see in-
              stead for filtered values.

              INDENT  Change  primary  indent  width  of wide mode output. See
              --indent.

              INDENTS Change primary indents of narrow  wrapped  mode  output,
              and second level indents. See --indents.

              LIMIT  Overrides default of 10 IP addresses per IF. This is only
              of interest to sys admins  running  servers  with  many  IP  ad-
              dresses.

              LINES_MAX  Values:  [-2-xxx]. See -Y for explanation and values.
              Use -Y -3 to restore default unlimited output lines. Avoid using
              this  in general unless the machine is a headless system and you
              want the output to be always controlled.

              MAX_WRAP (or WRAP_MAX) The maximum width where the line  starter
              wraps  to  its own line. If terminal/console width or --width is
              less than wrap width, wrapping of line starter occurs. Overrides
              default. See --max-wrap. If 80 or less, wrap will never happen.

              NO_DIG  Set  to 1 or true to disable WAN IP use of dig and force
              use of alternate downloaders.

              NO_DOAS Set to 1 or true to disable internal use of doas.

              NO_HTML_WAN Set to 1 or true to disable WAN IP use of HTML Down-
              loaders and force use of dig only, or nothing if dig disabled as
              well. Same as --no-html-wan. Only use if  dig  is  failing,  and
              HTML downloaders are hanging.

              NO_SUDO Set to 1 or true to disable internal use of sudo.

              PARTITION_SORT  Overrides  default  partition  report  sort. See
              --partition-sort for options.

              PS_COUNT The default number of items showing per -t type,  m  or
              c. Default is 5.

              SENSORS_CPU_NO  In  cases  of  ambiguous temp1/temp2 (inxi can't
              figure out which is the CPU), forces sensors to use either value
              1  or  2 as CPU temperature. See the above configuration page on
              smxi.org for full info.

              SENSORS_EXCLUDE Exclude supplied sensor array[s] from sensor re-
              port.  Override with --sensors-default. See --sensors-exclude.

              SENSORS_USE  Use  only  supplied  sensor array[s]. Override with
              --sensors-default. See --sensors-use.

              SEP2_CONSOLE Replaces default key / value separator of ':'. Test
              with --separator.

              USB_SYS Forces all USB data to use /sys instead of lsusb.

              WAN_IP_URL  Forces  -i  to  use supplied URL, and to not use dig
              (dig is generally much faster). URL must begin with http or ftp.
              Note  that  if  you  use this, the downloader set tests will run
              each time you start inxi whether a downloader feature  is  going
              to be used or not.

              The  IP  address  from the URL must be the last item on the last
              (non-empty) line of the URL's page content source code.

              Same as --wan-ip-url [URL]

              WEATHER_SOURCE Values: [0-9]. Same as --weather-source.   Values
              4-9  are  not  currently  supported,  but this can change at any
              time.

              WEATHER_UNIT Values: [m|i|mi|im]. Same as --weather-unit.

       Color Options
              It's best to use the -c [94-99] color selector tool to  set  the
              following values because it will correctly update the configura-
              tion file and remove any invalid or conflicting  items,  but  if
              you  prefer to create your own configuration files, here are the
              options. All take the integer value from the  options  available
              in -c 94-99.

              NOTE:  All  default  and configuration file set color values are
              removed when output is piped or redirected. You must use the ex-
              plicit -c [color number] option if you want colors to be present
              in the piped/redirected output (creating a PDF for example).

              CONSOLE_COLOR_SCHEME The color scheme for console output (not in
              X/Wayland).

              GLOBAL_COLOR_SCHEME Overrides all other color schemes.

              IRC_COLOR_SCHEME Desktop X/Wayland IRC CLI color scheme.

              IRC_CONS_COLOR_SCHEME Out of X/Wayland, IRC CLI color scheme.

              IRC_X_TERM_COLOR_SCHEME  In  X/Wayland IRC client terminal color
              scheme.

              VIRT_TERM_COLOR_SCHEME Color scheme for virtual terminal  output
              (in X/Wayland).

       Developer Options
              These are useful only for developers.

              FAKE_DATA_DIR - change default fake data directory location. See
              --fake-data-dir.

BUGS
       Please report bugs using the following resources.

       You may be asked to run the inxi debugger  tool  (see  --debug  21/22),
       which  will  upload  a  data  dump of system files for use in debugging
       inxi. These data dumps are very important since they  provide  us  with
       all the real system data inxi uses to parse out its report.

AUTHOR AND CONTRIBUTORS TO CODE
       inxi is a fork of locsmif's very clever infobash script.

       Original infobash author and copyright holder: Copyright (C)  2005-2007
       Michiel de Boer aka locsmif

       inxi version: Copyright (C) 2008-2025 Harald Hope

       This  man  page was originally created by Gordon Spencer (aka aus9) and
       is maintained by Harald Hope (aka h2 or TechAdmin).

       Initial CPU logic, konversation version logic,  occasional  maintenance
       fixes,  and  the  initial  xiin.py tool for /sys parsing (obsolete, but
       still very much appreciated for  all  the  valuable  debugger  data  it
       helped generate): Scott Rogers

       Further fixes (listed as known):

       Horst Tritremmel <hjt at sidux.com>

       Steven  Barrett  (aka:  damentz)  -  USB audio patch; swap percent used
       patch.

       Jarett.Stevens - dmidecode -M patch for older systems with no /sys.

SPECIAL THANKS TO THE FOLLOWING
       The nice people at irc.oftc.net channels #linux-smokers-club and #smxi,
       who  all  really  have  to be considered to be co-developers because of
       their non-stop enthusiasm and willingness to provide real-time  testing
       and debugging of inxi development over the years.

       LinuxQuestions.org  Slackware forum members, for major help with devel-
       opment and debugging new or refactored features, particularly  the  re-
       done CPU logic of 2021-12.

       Siduction  forum  members, who have helped get some features working by
       providing a large number of datasets that have revealed possible varia-
       tions, particularly for the RAM -m option.

       AntiX users and admins, who have helped greatly with testing and debug-
       ging, particularly for the 3.0.0 release.

       ArcherSeven (Max), Brett Bohnenkamper (aka KittyKatt), and Iotaka,  who
       always  manage to find the weirdest or most extreme hardware and setups
       that help make inxi much more robust.

       For the vastly underrated skill of report error/glitch  catching,  Pete
       Haddow.   His  patience  and  focus in going through inxi repeatedly to
       find errors and inconsistencies is much appreciated.

       For a huge boost to BSD support, Stan Vandiver, who did a lot of  test-
       ing and setup many remote access systems for testing and development.

       For  testing,  bug  finding, suggestions, feature requests, MrMazda. He
       has over the years has helped shape inxi into what it is today, in par-
       ticular but not limited to, the Graphics features.

       All  the inxi package maintainers, distro support people, forum modera-
       tors, and in particular, sys admins with their particular issues, which
       almost  always  help  make  inxi  better, and any others who contribute
       ideas, suggestions, and patches.

       Without a wide range of diverse Linux kernel-based Free Desktop systems
       to test on, we could never have gotten inxi to be as reliable and solid
       as it's turning out to be.

       And of course, a big thanks to locsmif, who figured out a  lot  of  the
       core ideas, logic, and tricks originally used in inxi Gawk/Bash.
