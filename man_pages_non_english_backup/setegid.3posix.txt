SETEGID(3POSIX)            POSIX Programmer's Manual           SETEGID(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       setegid — set the effective group ID

SYNOPSIS
       #include <unistd.h>

       int setegid(gid_t gid);

DESCRIPTION
       If gid is equal to the real group ID or the saved set-group-ID,  or  if
       the  process has appropriate privileges, setegid() shall set the effec‐
       tive group ID of the calling process to gid; the real group  ID,  saved
       set-group-ID, and any supplementary group IDs shall remain unchanged.

       The setegid() function shall not affect the supplementary group list in
       any way.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, 0 shall be returned; otherwise, -1 shall be
       returned and errno set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The setegid() function shall fail if:

       EINVAL The value of the gid argument is invalid and is not supported by
              the implementation.

       EPERM  The process does not have appropriate privileges  and  gid  does
              not match the real group ID or the saved set-group-ID.
