PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       remove — remove a file

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdio.h>

       int remove(const char *path);

DESCRIPTION
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with  the
       ISO C  standard.  Any  conflict between the requirements described here
       and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017
       defers to the ISO C standard.

       The  remove()  function  shall  cause  the  file  named by the pathname
       pointed to by path to be no longer accessible by that  name.  A  subse‐
       quent  attempt  to open that file using that name shall fail, unless it
       is created anew.

       If path does not name a directory, remove(path) shall be equivalent  to
       unlink(path).

       If  path  names  a  directory,  remove(path)  shall  be  equivalent  to
       rmdir(path).

RETURN VALUE
       Refer to rmdir() or unlink().

ERRORS
       Refer to rmdir() or unlink().

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES

           int status;
           ...
           status = remove("/home/cnd/old_mods");

APPLICATION USAGE
