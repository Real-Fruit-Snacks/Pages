NAME
       Sub::Exporter::Progressive - Only use Sub::Exporter if you need it

VERSION
       version 0.001013

SYNOPSIS
        package Syntax::Keyword::Gather;

        use Sub::Exporter::Progressive -setup => {
          exports => [qw( break gather gathered take )],
          groups => {
            default => [qw( break gather gathered take )],
          },
        };

        # elsewhere

        # uses Exporter for speed
        use Syntax::Keyword::Gather;

        # somewhere else

        # uses Sub::Exporter for features
        use Syntax::Keyword::Gather 'gather', take => { -as => 'grab' };

DESCRIPTION
       Sub::Exporter is an incredibly powerful module, but with that power
       comes great responsibility, er- as well as some runtime penalties.
       This module is a "Sub::Exporter" wrapper that will let your users just
       use Exporter if all they are doing is picking exports, but use
       "Sub::Exporter" if your users try to use "Sub::Exporter"'s more
       advanced features, like renaming exports, if they try to use them.

       Note that this module will export @EXPORT, @EXPORT_OK and %EXPORT_TAGS
       package variables for "Exporter" to work.  Additionally, if your
       package uses advanced "Sub::Exporter" features like currying, this
       module will only ever use "Sub::Exporter", so you might as well use it
       directly.
