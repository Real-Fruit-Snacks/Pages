PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       pthread_attr_getschedpolicy, pthread_attr_setschedpolicy — get and  set
       the schedpolicy attribute (REALTIME THREADS)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pthread.h>

       int pthread_attr_getschedpolicy(const pthread_attr_t *restrict attr,
           int *restrict policy);
       int pthread_attr_setschedpolicy(pthread_attr_t *attr, int policy);

DESCRIPTION
       The   pthread_attr_getschedpolicy()  and  pthread_attr_setschedpolicy()
       functions, respectively, shall get and set the schedpolicy attribute in
       the attr argument.

       The  supported values of policy shall include SCHED_FIFO, SCHED_RR, and
       SCHED_OTHER, which are defined in the <sched.h>  header.  When  threads
       executing   with   the   scheduling  policy  SCHED_FIFO,  SCHED_RR,  or
       SCHED_SPORADIC are waiting on a mutex, they shall acquire the mutex  in
       priority order when the mutex is unlocked.

       The  behavior  is undefined if the value specified by the attr argument
       to pthread_attr_getschedpolicy() or pthread_attr_setschedpolicy()  does
       not refer to an initialized thread attributes object.

RETURN VALUE
       If      successful,      the      pthread_attr_getschedpolicy()     and
       pthread_attr_setschedpolicy() functions shall return  zero;  otherwise,
       an error number shall be returned to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The pthread_attr_setschedpolicy() function shall fail if:

       ENOTSUP
              An  attempt  was  made  to  set  the attribute to an unsupported
              value.

       The pthread_attr_setschedpolicy() function may fail if:

       EINVAL The value of policy is not valid.

       These functions shall not return an error code of [EINTR].

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       After these attributes have been set, a thread can be created with  the
       specified attributes using pthread_create().  Using these routines does
       not affect the current running thread.

       See Section 2.9.4, Thread Scheduling  for  further  details  on  thread
       scheduling attributes and their default settings.

RATIONALE
       If an implementation detects that the value specified by the attr argu‐
       ment to pthread_attr_getschedpolicy() or  pthread_attr_setschedpolicy()
       does not refer to an initialized thread attributes object, it is recom‐
       mended that the function should fail and report an [EINVAL] error.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
