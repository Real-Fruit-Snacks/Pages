NAME
       iswupper - test for uppercase wide character

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wctype.h>

       int iswupper(wint_t wc);

DESCRIPTION
       The  iswupper()  function is the wide-character equivalent of the isup-
       per(3) function.  It tests whether wc is a wide character belonging  to
       the wide-character class "upper".

       The  wide-character  class  "upper" is a subclass of the wide-character
       class "alpha", and therefore also  a  subclass  of  the  wide-character
       class  "alnum",  of  the  wide-character class "graph" and of the wide-
       character class "print".

       Being a subclass of the wide-character class "print", the  wide-charac-
       ter class "upper" is disjoint from the wide-character class "cntrl".

       Being  a subclass of the wide-character class "graph", the wide-charac-
       ter class "upper" is disjoint from the wide-character class "space" and
       its subclass "blank".

       Being  a subclass of the wide-character class "alnum", the wide-charac-
       ter class "upper" is disjoint from the wide-character class "punct".

       Being a subclass of the wide-character class "alpha", the  wide-charac-
       ter class "upper" is disjoint from the wide-character class "digit".

       The  wide-character class "upper" contains at least those characters wc
       which are equal to towupper(wc) and different from towlower(wc).

       The wide-character class "upper" always contains at least  the  letters
       'A' to 'Z'.

RETURN VALUE
       The  iswupper()  function returns nonzero if wc is a wide character be-
       longing to the wide-character class  "upper".   Otherwise,  it  returns
       zero.

NOTES
       The behavior of iswupper() depends on the LC_CTYPE category of the cur-
       rent locale.

       This  function is not very appropriate for dealing with Unicode charac-
       ters, because Unicode knows about three cases: upper, lower, and  title
       case.
