DESCRIPTION
       dcb rewr is used to configure the rewrite table, in the DCB (Data Cen-
       ter Bridging) subsystem.  The rewrite table is used to rewrite certain
       values in the packet headers, based on packet priority.

       DCB rewrite entries are, like DCB APP entries, 3-tuples of selector,
       protocol ID, and priority. Selector is an enumeration that picks one of
       the prioritization namespaces. Currently, only the DSCP and PCP selec-
       tor namespaces are supported by dcb rewr.

       The rewrite table is a list of DCB rewrite rules, that applies to pack-
       ets with matching priority.  Notably, it is valid to have conflicting
       rewrite assignment for the same selector and priority. For example, the
       set of two rewrite entries (DSCP, 10, 1) and (DSCP, 11, 1), where pack-
       ets with priority 1 should have its DSCP value rewritten to both 10 and
       11, form a well-defined rewrite table.  dcb rewr tool allows low-level
       management of the rewrite table by adding and deleting individual re-
       write 3-tuples through add and del commands. On the other hand, the
       command replace does what one would typically want in this situa-
       tion--first adds the new configuration, and then removes the obsolete
       one, so that only one rewrite rule is in effect for a given selector
       and priority.

COMMANDS
       show   Display all entries with a given selector. When no selector is
              given, shows all rewrite table entries categorized per selector.

       flush  Remove all entries with a given selector. When no selector is
              given, removes all rewrite table entries.

       add
       del    Add and, respectively, remove individual rewrite 3-tuples to and
              from the DCB rewrite table.

       replace
              Take the list of entries mentioned as parameter, and add those
              that are not present in the rewrite table yet. Then remove those
              entries, whose selector and priority have been mentioned as pa-
              rameter, but not with the exact same protocol ID. This has the
              effect of, for the given selector and priority, causing that the
              table only contains the protocol ID (or ID's) given as parame-
              ter.

PARAMETERS
       The following table shows parameters in a way that they would be used
       with add, del and replace commands. For show and flush, the parameter
       name is to be used as a simple keyword without further arguments.

       prio-dscp DSCP-MAP
              DSCP-MAP uses the array parameter syntax, see dcb(8) for de-
              tails. Keys are priorities, values are DSCP points for traffic
              with matching priority. DSCP points can be written either di-
              rectly as numeric values, or using symbolic names specified in
              /etc/iproute2/rt_dsfield (however note that the file specifies
              full 8-bit dsfield values, whereas dcb rewr will only use the
              higher six bits).  dcb rewr show will similarly format DSCP val-
              ues as symbolic names if possible. The command line option -N
              turns the show translation off.

       prio-pcp PCP-MAP
              PCP-MAP uses the array parameter syntax, see dcb(8) for details.
              Keys are priorities. Values are PCP/DEI for traffic with match-
              ing priority. PCP/DEI values are written as a combination of nu-
              meric- and symbolic values, to accommodate for both. PCP always
              in numeric form e.g 0 ..  7 and DEI in symbolic form e.g 'de'
              (drop-eligible), indicating that the DEI bit is 1 or 'nd' (not-
              drop-eligible), indicating that the DEI bit is 0.  In combina-
              tion 1:2de translates to a mapping of priority 1 to PCP=2 and
              DEI=1.

EXAMPLE & USAGE
       Add a rule to rewrite DSCP to 0, 24 and 48 for traffic with priority 0,
       3 and 6, respectively:

       # dcb rewr add dev eth0 prio-dscp 0:0 3:24 6:48

       Add a rule to rewrite DSCP to 25 for traffic with priority 3:

       # dcb rewr add dev eth0 prio-dscp 3:25
       # dcb rewr show dev eth0 prio-dscp
       prio-dscp 0:0 3:CS3 3:25 6:CS6
       # dcb -N rewr show dev eth0 prio-dscp
       prio-dscp 0:0 3:24 3:25 6:48

       Reconfigure the table so that only one rule exists for rewriting traf-
       fic with priority 3.

       # dcb rewr replace dev eth0 prio-dscp 3:26
       # dcb rewr -N show dev eth0 prio-dscp
       prio-dscp 0:0 3:26 6:48

       Flush all DSCP rules:

       # dcb rewr flush dev eth0 prio-dscp
       # dcb rewr show dev eth0 prio-dscp
       (nothing)

       Add a rule to rewrite PCP to 1 and DEI to 0 for traffic with priority 1
       and a rule to rewrite PCP to 2 and DEI to 1 for traffic with priority
       2:

       # dcb rewr add dev eth0 prio-pcp 1:1nd 2:2de
       # dcb rewr show dev eth0 prio-pcp
       prio-pcp 1:1nd 2:2de

EXIT STATUS
       Exit status is 0 if command was successful or a positive integer upon
       failure.
