NAME
       setlocale — set program locale

SYNOPSIS
       #include <locale.h>

       char *setlocale(int category, const char *locale);

DESCRIPTION
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with  the
       ISO C  standard.  Any  conflict between the requirements described here
       and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017
       defers to the ISO C standard.

       The  setlocale()  function  selects the appropriate piece of the global
       locale, as specified by the category and locale arguments, and  can  be
       used  to  change or query the entire global locale or portions thereof.
       The value LC_ALL for category names the  entire  global  locale;  other
       values for category name only a part of the global locale:

       LC_COLLATE  Affects  the behavior of regular expressions and the colla‐
                   tion functions.

       LC_CTYPE    Affects the  behavior  of  regular  expressions,  character
                   classification,  character  conversion functions, and wide-
                   character functions.

       LC_MESSAGES Affects the affirmative and negative  response  expressions
                   returned  by nl_langinfo() and the way message catalogs are
                   located. It may also affect the behavior of functions  that
                   return or write message strings.

       LC_MONETARY Affects the behavior of functions that handle monetary val‐
                   ues.

       LC_NUMERIC  Affects the behavior of functions that handle numeric  val‐
                   ues.

       LC_TIME     Affects the behavior of the time conversion functions.

       The  locale  argument is a pointer to a character string containing the
       required setting of category.  The contents of this string  are  imple‐
       mentation-defined.  In  addition, the following preset values of locale
       are defined for all settings of category:

       "POSIX"     Specifies the minimal environment for  C-language  transla‐
                   tion  called  the POSIX locale. The POSIX locale is the de‐
                   fault global locale at entry to main().

       "C"         Equivalent to "POSIX".

       ""          Specifies  an  implementation-defined  native  environment.
                   The  determination  of  the  name of the new locale for the
                   specified category depends on the value of  the  associated
                   environment  variables, LC_* and LANG; see the Base Defini‐
                   tions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Chapter 7, Locale and Chapter
                   8, Environment Variables.

       A null pointer
                   Directs setlocale() to query the current global locale set‐
                   ting and return the name of the locale if category  is  not
                   LC_ALL,  or  a  string which encodes the locale name(s) for
                   all of the individual categories if category is LC_ALL.

       Setting all of the categories of the global locale is similar  to  suc‐
       cessively setting each individual category of the global locale, except
       that all error checking is done before any actions  are  performed.  To
       set all the categories of the global locale, setlocale() can be invoked
       as:

           setlocale(LC_ALL, "");

       In this case, setlocale() shall first verify that the values of all the
       environment  variables  it needs according to the precedence rules (de‐
       scribed in the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Chapter 8,  En‐
       vironment Variables) indicate supported locales. If the value of any of
       these environment variable searches yields a locale that  is  not  sup‐
       ported  (and non-null), setlocale() shall return a null pointer and the
       global locale shall not be changed. If all environment  variables  name
       supported  locales,  setlocale() shall proceed as if it had been called
       for each category, using the appropriate value from the associated  en‐
       vironment  variable or from the implementation-defined default if there
       is no such value.

       The global locale established using setlocale() shall only be  used  in
       threads  for  which no current locale has been set using uselocale() or
       whose current locale has been set to the  global  locale  using  uselo‐
       cale(LC_GLOBAL_LOCALE).

       The  implementation shall behave as if no function defined in this vol‐
       ume of POSIX.1‐2017 calls setlocale().

       The setlocale() function need not be thread-safe.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, setlocale() shall return the string associ‐
       ated  with the specified category for the new locale. Otherwise, setlo‐
       cale() shall return a null pointer and the global locale shall  not  be
       changed.

       A  null  pointer for locale shall cause setlocale() to return a pointer
       to the string associated with the specified category  for  the  current
       global locale. The global locale shall not be changed.

       The  string returned by setlocale() is such that a subsequent call with
       that string and its associated category shall restore that part of  the
       global  locale.  The  application shall not modify the string returned.
       The returned string pointer might be invalidated or the string  content
       might be overwritten by a subsequent call to setlocale().  The returned
       pointer might also be invalidated if the calling thread is terminated.

ERRORS
       No errors are defined.

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       The following code illustrates how a program can initialize the  inter‐
       national  environment for one language, while selectively modifying the
       global locale such that regular expressions and string  operations  can
       be applied to text recorded in a different language:

           setlocale(LC_ALL, "De");
           setlocale(LC_COLLATE, "Fr@dict");

       Internationalized programs can initiate language operation according to
       environment variable settings  (see  the  Base  Definitions  volume  of
       POSIX.1‐2017,  Section  8.2, Internationalization Variables) by calling
       setlocale() as follows:

           setlocale(LC_ALL, "");

       Changing the setting of LC_MESSAGES has no effect on catalogs that have
       already been opened by calls to catopen().

       In  order  to  make  use  of  different  locale settings while multiple
       threads are running, applications should use uselocale() in  preference
       to setlocale().

RATIONALE
       References  to the international environment or locale in the following
       text relate to the global locale for the process. This can be  overrid‐
       den for individual threads using uselocale().

       The  ISO C standard defines a collection of functions to support inter‐
       nationalization.  One of the most significant aspects  of  these  func‐
       tions  is  a  facility  to set and query the international environment.
       The international environment is a repository of information  that  af‐
       fects the behavior of certain functionality, namely:

        1. Character handling

        2. Collating

        3. Date/time formatting

        4. Numeric editing

        5. Monetary formatting

        6. Messaging

       The  setlocale()  function  provides the application developer with the
       ability to set all or portions, called categories, of the international
       environment.  These categories correspond to the areas of functionality
       mentioned above. The syntax for setlocale() is as follows:

           char *setlocale(int category, const char *locale);

       where category is the name of one of following categories, namely:

              LC_COLLATE LC_CTYPE LC_MESSAGES LC_MONETARY LC_NUMERIC LC_TIME

       In addition, a special value called LC_ALL directs setlocale()  to  set
       all categories.

       There are two primary uses of setlocale():

        1. Querying  the  international environment to find out what it is set
           to

        2. Setting the international environment, or  locale,  to  a  specific
           value

       The  behavior  of  setlocale()  in  these two areas is described below.
       Since it is difficult to describe the behavior in words,  examples  are
       used to illustrate the behavior of specific uses.

       To  query  the international environment, setlocale() is invoked with a
       specific category and the null pointer as the locale. The null  pointer
       is  a  special  directive  to setlocale() that tells it to query rather
       than set the international environment.  The following syntax  is  used
       to query the name of the international environment:

           setlocale({LC_ALL, LC_COLLATE, LC_CTYPE, LC_MESSAGES, LC_MONETARY, \
               LC_NUMERIC, LC_TIME},(char *) NULL);

       The  setlocale()  function shall return the string corresponding to the
       current international environment. This value may be used by  a  subse‐
       quent  call  to  setlocale()  to reset the international environment to
       this value. However, it should be noted that the return value from set‐
       locale()  may  be a pointer to a static area within the function and is
       not guaranteed to remain unchanged (that is, it may be  modified  by  a
       subsequent  call to setlocale()).  Therefore, if the purpose of calling
       setlocale() is to save the value of the current international  environ‐
       ment  so  it can be changed and reset later, the return value should be
       copied to an array of char in the calling program.

       There are three ways to set the international environment  with  setlo‐
       cale():

       setlocale(category, string)
             This usage sets a specific category in the international environ‐
             ment to a specific  value  corresponding  to  the  value  of  the
             string.  A specific example is provided below:

                 setlocale(LC_ALL, "fr_FR.ISO-8859-1");

             In  this example, all categories of the international environment
             are   set   to   the   locale   corresponding   to   the   string
             "fr_FR.ISO-8859-1", or to the French language as spoken in France
             using the ISO/IEC 8859‐1:1998 standard codeset.

             If the string does not correspond to a valid locale,  setlocale()
             shall  return a null pointer and the international environment is
             not changed. Otherwise, setlocale() shall return the name of  the
             locale just set.

       setlocale(category, "C")
             The  ISO C standard states that one locale must exist on all con‐
             forming implementations. The name of the locale is C  and  corre‐
             sponds  to  a minimal international environment needed to support
             the C programming language.

       setlocale(category, "")
             This sets a specific category to  an  implementation-defined  de‐
             fault.   This  corresponds  to the value of the environment vari‐
             ables.
