PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       wcscspn — get the length of a complementary wide substring

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       size_t wcscspn(const wchar_t *ws1, const wchar_t *ws2);

DESCRIPTION
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with  the
       ISO C  standard.  Any  conflict between the requirements described here
       and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017
       defers to the ISO C standard.

       The wcscspn() function shall compute the length (in wide characters) of
       the maximum initial segment of the wide-character string pointed to  by
       ws1  which consists entirely of wide-character codes not from the wide-
       character string pointed to by ws2.

RETURN VALUE
       The wcscspn() function shall return the length of the initial substring
       of ws1; no return value is reserved to indicate an error.

ERRORS
       No errors are defined.
