NAME
       pamfix - repair a Netpbm image with various corruptions

SYNOPSIS
       pamfix

       [-truncate] [-changemaxval] [-clip] [-verbose]

       [netpbmfile]

       Minimum  unique abbreviation of option is acceptable.  You may use dou‐
       ble hyphens instead of single hyphen to denote options.   You  may  use
       white space in place of the equals sign to separate an option name from
       its value.

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       pamfix reads a stream that is mostly a Netpbm image but may  have  cer‐
       tain  types  of corruptions and produces a valid Netpbm image that pre‐
       serves much of the information in the original.

       In particular, Netpbm salvages streams that are truncated and that con‐
       tain illegally large sample values.

       pamfix looks at only on the first image in a multi-image stream.

   Truncated Stream
       This  is  a stream that is missing the last part.  Netpbm corrects this
       by creating an output image that simply has fewer rows.

       You select this kind of repair with a -truncate option.

       The header of a Netpbm image implies how large the image must  be  (how
       many  bytes  the  file  must contain).  If the file is actually smaller
       than that, a Netpbm program that tries to read the image fails, with an
       error  message  telling  you that it couldn't read the whole file.  The
       data in the file is arranged in row order, from top to bottom, and  the
       most  common  reason for the file being smaller than its header says it
       should be is because the bottommost rows are simply missing.  So pamfix
       assumes  that  is the case and generates a new image with just the rows
       that are readable.  (technically, that means the output's header  indi‐
       cates a smaller number of rows and omits any partial last row).

       The most common way for a Netpbm file to be small is that something in‐
       terrupted the program that generated it before it was finished  writing
       the file.  For example, the program ran out of its own input or encoun‐
       tered a bug or ran out of space in which to write the output.

       Another problem pamfix deals with is where the file isn't actually  too
       small, but because of a system error, a byte in the middle of it cannot
       be read (think of a disk storage failure).  pamfix reads the input  se‐
       quentially  until  it  can't  read  any further, for any reason.  So it
       treats such an image as a truncated one, ignoring all  data  after  the
       unreadable byte.

       But be aware that an image file is sometimes too small because of a bug
       in the program that generated it, and in that case it is not  simply  a
       matter  of  the bottom of the image missing, so pamfix simply creates a
       valid Netpbm image containing a garbage picture.

       If you want to test an image file to see if it is  corrupted  by  being
       too small, use pamfile --allimages .  It fails with an error message if
       the file is too small.

       If you want to cut the bottom off a valid Netpbm image, use pamcut.

   Excessive Sample Value
       This is a stream that contains a purported sample value that is  higher
       than the maxval of the image.

       The  header of a Netpbm image tells the maxval of the image, which is a
       value that gives meaning to all the sample values in the  raster.   The
       sample  values  represent  a  fraction of the maxval, so a sample value
       that is greater than the maxval makes no sense.

       A regular Netpbm program fails if you give it  input  that  contains  a
       value larger than the maxval where a sample value belongs.

       pamfix has three ways of salvaging such a stream:

       •      Clip to the maxval.  Request this with -clip.

       •      Raise  the maxval, thus lowering the fraction represented by ev‐
              ery sample in the image.  Request this with -changemaxval.

       •      Truncate the image at the first invalid sample  value.   Request
              this with -truncate and neither -clip nor -changemaxval.

       You cannot specify both -clip and -changemaxval.

OPTIONS
       In  addition  to  the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm
       (most notably -quiet, see
        Common Options ⟨index.html#commonoptions⟩  ),  pamfix  recognizes  the
       following command line options:

       -truncate
              Create  a  truncated  output image from all the valid input rows
              that could be read.

       -changemaxval
              Raise the maxval to cope with pixel values that exceed the  max‐
              val stated in the header of the input file.

       -clip  Change  all  pixel  values  that exceed the maxval stated in the
              header of the input file.

       -verbose
              Report details of the transportation to standard error.

HISTORY
       pamfix was new in Netpbm 10.66 (March 2014).  But it grew out  of  pam‐
       fixtrunc,  which  was new in Netpbm 10.38 (March 2007) and did only the
       truncated image repair (and for invalid sample values would simply pass
       them through to its output, generating an invalid Netpbm image).
