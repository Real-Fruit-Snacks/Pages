MEMCPY(3POSIX)             POSIX Programmer's Manual            MEMCPY(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       memcpy — copy bytes in memory

SYNOPSIS
       #include <string.h>

       void *memcpy(void *restrict s1, const void *restrict s2, size_t n);

DESCRIPTION
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with  the
       ISO C  standard.  Any  conflict between the requirements described here
       and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017
       defers to the ISO C standard.

       The  memcpy() function shall copy n bytes from the object pointed to by
       s2 into the object pointed to by s1.  If copying  takes  place  between
       objects that overlap, the behavior is undefined.

RETURN VALUE
       The  memcpy()  function shall return s1; no return value is reserved to
       indicate an error.

ERRORS
       No errors are defined.

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       The memcpy() function does not check for the overflow of the  receiving
       memory area.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
