NAME
       Image::ExifTool::Pentax - Pentax/Asahi maker notes tags

SYNOPSIS
       This module is loaded automatically by Image::ExifTool when required.

DESCRIPTION
       This module contains definitions required by Image::ExifTool to
       interpret Pentax and Asahi maker notes in EXIF information.

NOTES
       I couldn't find a good source for Pentax maker notes information, but
       I've managed to discover a fair bit of information by analyzing sample
       images downloaded from the internet, and through tests with my own
       Optio S, Optio WP, K10D, K-01 and K-5, and with help provided by other
       ExifTool users (see "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS").

       The Pentax maker notes are stored in standard EXIF format, but the
       offsets used for some of their cameras are wacky.  The Optio 330 gives
       the offset relative to the offset of the tag in the directory, the
       Optio WP uses a base offset in the middle of nowhere, and the Optio 550
       uses different (and totally illogical) bases for different menu
       entries.  Very weird.  (It wouldn't surprise me if Pentax can't read
       their own maker notes!)  Luckily, there are only a few entries in the
       maker notes which are large enough to require offsets, so this doesn't
       affect much useful information.  ExifTool attempts to make sense of
       this fiasco by making an assumption about where the information should
       be stored to deduce the correct offsets.
