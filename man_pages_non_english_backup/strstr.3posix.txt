PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       strstr — find a substring

SYNOPSIS
       #include <string.h>

       char *strstr(const char *s1, const char *s2);

DESCRIPTION
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with  the
       ISO C  standard.  Any  conflict between the requirements described here
       and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017
       defers to the ISO C standard.

       The  strstr()  function shall locate the first occurrence in the string
       pointed to by s1 of the sequence of bytes  (excluding  the  terminating
       NUL character) in the string pointed to by s2.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon  successful completion, strstr() shall return a pointer to the lo‐
       cated string or a null pointer if the string is not found.

       If s2 points to a string with zero length, the  function  shall  return
       s1.
