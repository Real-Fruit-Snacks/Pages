PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       mq_close — close a message queue (REALTIME)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <mqueue.h>

       int mq_close(mqd_t mqdes);

DESCRIPTION
       The mq_close() function shall remove the association between  the  mes‐
       sage queue descriptor, mqdes, and its message queue. The results of us‐
       ing this message queue descriptor after  successful  return  from  this
       mq_close(),  and until the return of this message queue descriptor from
       a subsequent mq_open(), are undefined.

       If the process has successfully attached a notification request to  the
       message queue via this mqdes, this attachment shall be removed, and the
       message queue is available for another process to attach for  notifica‐
       tion.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon  successful  completion,  the  mq_close()  function shall return a
       value of zero; otherwise, the function shall return a value of  -1  and
       set errno to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The mq_close() function shall fail if:

       EBADF  The mqdes argument is not a valid message queue descriptor.
