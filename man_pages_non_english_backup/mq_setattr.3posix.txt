MQ_SETATTR(3POSIX)         POSIX Programmer's Manual        MQ_SETATTR(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       mq_setattr — set message queue attributes (REALTIME)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <mqueue.h>

       int mq_setattr(mqd_t mqdes, const struct mq_attr *restrict mqstat,
           struct mq_attr *restrict omqstat);

DESCRIPTION
       The mq_setattr() function shall set attributes associated with the open
       message  queue  description  referenced by the message queue descriptor
       specified by mqdes.

       The message queue attributes corresponding to the following members de‐
       fined  in  the  mq_attr  structure shall be set to the specified values
       upon successful completion of mq_setattr():

       mq_flags    The value of this member is the bitwise-logical OR of  zero
                   or more of O_NONBLOCK and any implementation-defined flags.

       The  values of the mq_maxmsg, mq_msgsize, and mq_curmsgs members of the
       mq_attr structure shall be ignored by mq_setattr().

       If omqstat is non-NULL, the mq_setattr() function shall store,  in  the
       location  referenced  by omqstat, the previous message queue attributes
       and the current queue status.  These values shall be the same as  would
       be returned by a call to mq_getattr() at that point.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon  successful  completion, the function shall return a value of zero
       and the attributes of the message queue  shall  have  been  changed  as
       specified.

       Otherwise,  the  message  queue  attributes shall be unchanged, and the
       function shall return a value of -1 and set errno to indicate  the  er‐
       ror.

ERRORS
       The mq_setattr() function shall fail if:

       EBADF  The mqdes argument is not a valid message queue descriptor.
