REWIND(3POSIX)             POSIX Programmer's Manual            REWIND(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       rewind — reset the file position indicator in a stream

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdio.h>

       void rewind(FILE *stream);

DESCRIPTION
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with  the
       ISO C  standard.  Any  conflict between the requirements described here
       and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017
       defers to the ISO C standard.

       The call:

           rewind(stream)

       shall be equivalent to:

           (void) fseek(stream, 0L, SEEK_SET)

       except that rewind() shall also clear the error indicator.

       Since  rewind()  does not return a value, an application wishing to de‐
       tect errors should clear errno, then call rewind(),  and  if  errno  is
       non-zero, assume an error has occurred.

RETURN VALUE
       The rewind() function shall not return a value.

ERRORS
       Refer to fseek() with the exception of [EINVAL] which does not apply.

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       None.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
