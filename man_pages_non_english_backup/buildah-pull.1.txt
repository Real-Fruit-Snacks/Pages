buildah-pull(1)             General Commands Manual            buildah-pull(1)

NAME
       buildah-pull - Pull an image from a registry.

SYNOPSIS
       buildah pull [options] image

DESCRIPTION
       Pulls  an  image based upon the specified input. It supports all trans-
       ports from containers-transports(5) (see examples below). If no  trans-
       port  is  specified, the input is subject to short-name resolution (see
       containers-registries.conf(5)) and the  docker  (i.e.,  container  reg-
       istry) transport is used.

   DEPENDENCIES
       Buildah  resolves  the  path  to the registry to pull from by using the
       /etc/containers/registries.conf  file,   containers-registries.conf(5).
       If  the  buildah  pull  command  fails with an "image not known" error,
       first verify that the registries.conf file is installed and  configured
       appropriately.

RETURN VALUE
       The image ID of the image that was pulled.  On error 1 is returned.

OPTIONS
       --all-tags, -a

       All tagged images in the repository will be pulled.

       --arch="ARCH"

       Set the ARCH of the image to be pulled to the provided value instead of
       using the architecture of the host. (Examples: arm, arm64, 386,  amd64,
       ppc64le, s390x)

       --authfile path

       Path  of  the  authentication file. Default is ${XDG_\RUNTIME_DIR}/con-
       tainers/auth.json. If  XDG_RUNTIME_DIR  is  not  set,  the  default  is
       /run/containers/$UID/auth.json.  This file is created using buildah lo-
       gin.

       If the authorization  state  is  not  found  there,  $HOME/.docker/con-
       fig.json is checked, which is set using docker login.

       Note: You can also override the default path of the authentication file
       by setting the REGISTRY_AUTH_FILE  environment  variable.  export  REG-
       ISTRY_AUTH_FILE=path

       --cert-dir path

       Use  certificates at path (*.crt, *.cert, *.key) to connect to the reg-
       istry.  The default certificates directory is /etc/containers/certs.d.

       --creds creds

       The [username[:password]] to use to authenticate with the  registry  if
       required.   If  one  or  both  values  are not supplied, a command line
       prompt will appear and the value can be entered.  The password  is  en-
       tered without echo.

       --decryption-key key[:passphrase]

       The  [key[:passphrase]]  to  be  used for decryption of images. Key can
       point to keys and/or certificates. Decryption will be  tried  with  all
       keys.  If  the  key  is protected by a passphrase, it is required to be
       passed in the argument and omitted otherwise.

       --os="OS"

       Set the OS of the image to be pulled instead of using the current oper-
       ating system of the host.

       --platform="OS/ARCH[/VARIANT]"

       Set the OS/ARCH of the image to be pulled to the provided value instead
       of using the current operating system and architecture of the host (for
       example linux/arm).

       OS/ARCH  pairs  are those used by the Go Programming Language.  In sev-
       eral cases the ARCH value for a platform differs from one  produced  by
       other  tools  such as the arch command.  Valid OS and architecture name
       combinations  are  listed  as  values  for   $GOOS   and   $GOARCH   at
       https://golang.org/doc/install/source#environment,   and  can  also  be
       found by running go tool dist list.

       NOTE: The --platform option may not be used  in  combination  with  the
       --arch, --os, or --variant options.

       --policy=always|missing|never|newer

       Pull image policy. The default is missing.

              o always:  Always  pull the image and throw an error if the pull
                fails.

              o missing: Pull the image only if it could not be found  in  the
                local containers storage.  Throw an error if no image could be
                found and the pull fails.

              o never: Never pull the image but use the  one  from  the  local
                containers  storage.   Throw  an  error  if  no image could be
                found.

              o newer: Pull if the image on the registry is newer than the one
                in the local containers storage.  An image is considered to be
                newer when the digests  are  different.   Comparing  the  time
                stamps  is  prone  to errors.  Pull errors are suppressed if a
                local image was found.

       --quiet, -q

       If an image needs to be pulled from  the  registry,  suppress  progress
       output.

       --remove-signatures

       Don't copy signatures when pulling images.

       --retry attempts

       Number of times to retry in case of failure when performing pull of im-
       ages from registry.

       Defaults to 3.

       --retry-delay duration

       Duration of delay between retry attempts in case of failure  when  per-
       forming pull of images from registry.

       Defaults to 2s.

       --tls-verify bool-value

       Require  HTTPS  and  verification  of certificates when talking to con-
       tainer registries (defaults to true).  TLS verification cannot be  used
       when talking to an insecure registry.

       --variant=""

       Set the architecture variant of the image to be pulled.

EXAMPLE
       buildah pull imagename

       buildah pull docker://myregistry.example.com/imagename

       buildah pull docker-daemon:imagename:imagetag

       buildah pull docker-archive:filename

       buildah pull oci-archive:filename

       buildah pull dir:directoryname

       buildah  pull  --tls-verify=false myregistry/myrepository/imagename:im-
       agetag

       buildah pull  --creds=myusername:mypassword  --cert-dir  ~/auth  myreg-
       istry/myrepository/imagename:imagetag

       buildah  pull  --authfile=/tmp/auths/myauths.json  myregistry/myreposi-
       tory/imagename:imagetag

       buildah pull --arch=aarch64 myregistry/myrepository/imagename:imagetag

       buildah  pull  --arch=arm  --variant=v7  myregistry/myrepository/image-
       name:imagetag

ENVIRONMENT
       BUILD_REGISTRY_SOURCES

       BUILD_REGISTRY_SOURCES,  if set, is treated as a JSON object which con-
       tains lists  of  registry  names  under  the  keys  insecureRegistries,
       blockedRegistries, and allowedRegistries.

       When  pulling  an  image  from  a registry, if the name of the registry
       matches any of the items in the blockedRegistries list, the image  pull
       attempt  is  denied.   If there are registries in the allowedRegistries
       list, and the registry's name is not in the list, the pull  attempt  is
       denied.

       TMPDIR The TMPDIR environment variable allows the user to specify where
       temporary files are stored while pulling and pushing images.   Defaults
       to '/var/tmp'.

FILES
       registries.conf (/etc/containers/registries.conf)

       registries.conf  is  the  configuration file which specifies which con-
       tainer registries should be consulted when completing image names which
       do not include a registry or domain portion.

       policy.json (/etc/containers/policy.json)

       Signature policy file.  This defines the trust policy for container im-
       ages.  Controls which container registries can be used for  image,  and
       whether or not the tool should trust the images.
