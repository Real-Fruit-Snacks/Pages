NAME
       sane-cardscan - SANE backend for Corex CardScan usb scanners

DESCRIPTION
       The  sane-cardscan  library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy)
       backend which provides access to the Corex CardScan 800c & 600c  small-
       format scanners.

       The backend supports only grayscale and color modes and media of (theo‐
       retically) infinite length.

       This backend may support other scanners.  The  best  way  to  determine
       level of support is to get a trace of the windows driver in action, and
       send it to the author.

OPTIONS
       The cardscan backend supports the following options:

       --mode Gray|Color
              Selects the mode for the scan.

CONFIGURATION FILE
       The configuration file cardscan.conf is used to tell the backend how to
       look for scanners, and provide options controlling the operation of the
       backend.  This file is read each time the frontend asks the backend for
       a  list  of  scanners,  generally only when the frontend starts. If the
       configuration file is missing, the backend will use a set  of  compiled
       defaults, which are identical to the default configuration file shipped
       with SANE.

       Scanners can be specified in the configuration file in 2 ways:

       "usb 0x04c5 0x1042" (or other vendor/product ids)
              Requests backend to search all usb buses in the system for a de‐
              vice which uses that vendor and product id. The device will then
              be queried to determine if it is a cardscan scanner.

       "usb /dev/usb/scanner0" (or other device file)
              Some systems use a kernel driver to access  usb  scanners.  This
              method is untested.

       Additionally, there are two configuration options that control the pro‐
       tocol used by the backend:

       "lines_per_block 16" (or other number from 1 to 32)
              Controls the number of lines of image data  which  will  be  ac‐
              quired  in  each  pass.  Older scanners will require this number
              set lower, often 1.

       "has_cal_buffer 1" (1 or 0)
              Causes the backend to get calibration data from  scanner  during
              initialization.  Older scanners do not support this request, and
              must be set to 0.

ENVIRONMENT
       The backend uses a single  environment  variable,  SANE_DEBUG_CARDSCAN,
       which enables debugging output to stderr. Valid values are:

              5  Errors
              10 Function trace
              15 Function detail
              20 Option commands
              25 SCSI/USB trace
              30 SCSI/USB detail
              35 Useless noise

KNOWN ISSUES
              The  scanner does not seem to have much control possible, so the
              backend cannot set  x/y  coordinate  values,  resolutions,  etc.
              These  things  could  be simulated in the backend, but there are
              plenty of command line tools.
              The backend also does not send all the commands that the windows
              driver does, so it may not function the same.
              The backend does not have the calibration or ejection options of
              the windows driver.
