TPUT(1POSIX)               POSIX Programmer's Manual              TPUT(1POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       tput — change terminal characteristics

SYNOPSIS
       tput [-T type] operand...

DESCRIPTION
       The tput utility shall display terminal-dependent information. The man‐
       ner in which this information is retrieved is unspecified. The informa‐
       tion displayed shall clear the terminal screen, initialize  the  user's
       terminal, or reset the user's terminal, depending on the operand given.
       The exact consequences of displaying this information are unspecified.

OPTIONS
       The tput utility shall  conform  to  the  Base  Definitions  volume  of
       POSIX.1‐2017, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines.

       The following option shall be supported:

       -T type   Indicate the type of terminal. If this option is not supplied
                 and the TERM variable is unset or null,  an  unspecified  de‐
                 fault  terminal type shall be used. The setting of type shall
                 take precedence over the value in TERM.

OPERANDS
       The following strings shall be supported as operands by the implementa‐
       tion in the POSIX locale:

       clear     Display the clear-screen sequence.

       init      Display  the sequence that initializes the user's terminal in
                 an implementation-defined manner.

       reset     Display the sequence that resets the user's  terminal  in  an
                 implementation-defined manner.

       If a terminal does not support any of the operations described by these
       operands, this shall not be considered an error condition.

STDIN
       Not used.

INPUT FILES
       None.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of tput:

       LANG      Provide a default value for  the  internationalization  vari‐
                 ables  that are unset or null. (See the Base Definitions vol‐
                 ume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 8.2, Internationalization  Vari‐
                 ables  for  the  precedence of internationalization variables
                 used to determine the values of locale categories.)

       LC_ALL    If set to a non-empty string value, override  the  values  of
                 all the other internationalization variables.

       LC_CTYPE  Determine  the  locale for the interpretation of sequences of
                 bytes of text data as characters (for example, single-byte as
                 opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments).

       LC_MESSAGES
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format
                 and contents of diagnostic messages written to  standard  er‐
                 ror.

       NLSPATH   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing
                 of LC_MESSAGES.

       TERM      Determine the terminal type. If this  variable  is  unset  or
                 null,  and  if the -T option is not specified, an unspecified
                 default terminal type shall be used.

ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
       Default.

STDOUT
       If standard output is a terminal device, it may be used for writing the
       appropriate  sequence  to  clear  the screen or reset or initialize the
       terminal. If standard output is not a terminal  device,  undefined  re‐
       sults occur.

STDERR
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

OUTPUT FILES
       None.

EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
       None.

EXIT STATUS
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    The requested string was written successfully.

        1    Unspecified.

        2    Usage error.

        3    No information is available about the specified terminal type.

        4    The specified operand is invalid.

       >4    An error occurred.

CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
       If  one of the operands is not available for the terminal, tput contin‐
       ues processing the remaining operands.

       The following sections are informative.

APPLICATION USAGE
       The difference between resetting and initializing a  terminal  is  left
       unspecified,  as they vary greatly based on hardware types. In general,
       resetting is a more severe action.

       Some terminals use control characters to perform the stated  functions,
       and on such terminals it might make sense to use tput to store the ini‐
       tialization strings in a file or environment variable  for  later  use.
       However,  because other terminals might rely on system calls to do this
       work, the standard output cannot be used in a portable manner, such  as
       the following non-portable constructs:

           ClearVar=`tput clear`
           tput reset | mailx -s "Wake Up" ddg

EXAMPLES
        1. Initialize  the  terminal  according to the type of terminal in the
           environmental variable TERM.  This command can  be  included  in  a
           .profile file.

               tput init

        2. Reset a 450 terminal.

               tput -T 450 reset

RATIONALE
       The  list  of  operands was reduced to a minimum for the following rea‐
       sons:

        *  The only features chosen were those that were likely to be used  by
           human users interacting with a terminal.

        *  Specifying  the full terminfo set was not considered desirable, but
           the standard developers did not want to select among operands.

        *  This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 does not attempt  to  provide  applica‐
           tions  with  sophisticated  terminal handling capabilities, as that
           falls outside of its assigned scope and intersects with the respon‐
           sibilities of other standards bodies.

       The  difference  between  resetting and initializing a terminal is left
       unspecified as this varies greatly based on hardware types. In general,
       resetting is a more severe action.

       The  exit  status  of  1  is historically reserved for finding out if a
       Boolean operand is not set. Although the operands  were  reduced  to  a
       minimum,  the exit status of 1 should still be reserved for the Boolean
       operands, for those sites that wish to support them.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
