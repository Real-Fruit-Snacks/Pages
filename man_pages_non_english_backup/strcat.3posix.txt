STRCAT(3POSIX)             POSIX Programmer's Manual            STRCAT(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       strcat — concatenate two strings

SYNOPSIS
       #include <string.h>

       char *strcat(char *restrict s1, const char *restrict s2);

DESCRIPTION
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with  the
       ISO C  standard.  Any  conflict between the requirements described here
       and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017
       defers to the ISO C standard.

       The  strcat()  function shall append a copy of the string pointed to by
       s2 (including the terminating NUL character) to the end of  the  string
       pointed  to by s1.  The initial byte of s2 overwrites the NUL character
       at the end of s1.  If copying takes place between objects that overlap,
       the behavior is undefined.

RETURN VALUE
       The  strcat()  function shall return s1; no return value is reserved to
       indicate an error.

ERRORS
       No errors are defined.

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       This version is aligned with the ISO C standard; this does  not  affect
       compatibility  with XPG3 applications. Reliable error detection by this
       function was never guaranteed.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
