MATE-SESSION-SAVE(1)        General Commands Manual       MATE-SESSION-SAVE(1)

NAME
       mate-session-save - End or save the current MATE session

SYNOPSIS
       mate-session-save    [--logout]    [--force-logout]   [--logout-dialog]
       [--shutdown-dialog] [--gui] [--kill [--silent]]

DESCRIPTION
       The mate-session-save program can be used from a MATE session to either
       end  the  current MATE session or save a snapshot of the currently run‐
       ning applications (but not both). This session will be  later  restored
       at your next MATE session.

USAGE
       The --gui option will report errors in dialog boxes instead of printing
       to stderr.

       If called with the --logout option, the current MATE  session  will  be
       ended,  unless  logging  out  has been inhibited by an application. The
       --force-logout option can be used to end the session regardless of  the
       inhibition state.

       When  the --logout-dialog option is given, the standard dialog display‐
       ing logout options  is  displayed.  When  --shutdown-dialog  option  is
       given, the standard dialog displaying shutdown options is displayed.

       The  --kill  and  --silent options are deprecated. The --kill option is
       equivalent to the --logout-dialog option.  If  --silent  is  used  with
       --kill, then it will behave as if --logout was used.

       The  session  is not saved when mate-session-save is called with any of
       the options ending the session.
