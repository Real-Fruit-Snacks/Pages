GETRUSAGE(3POSIX)          POSIX Programmer's Manual         GETRUSAGE(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       getrusage -- get information about resource utilization

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/resource.h>

       int getrusage(int who, struct rusage *r_usage);

DESCRIPTION
       The getrusage() function shall provide measures of the  resources  used
       by  the  current  process  or  its terminated and waited-for child pro-
       cesses. If the value of the who argument  is  RUSAGE_SELF,  information
       shall  be  returned about resources used by the current process. If the
       value of the who argument is RUSAGE_CHILDREN, information shall be  re-
       turned  about  resources used by the terminated and waited-for children
       of the current process. If the child is never waited for (for  example,
       if the parent has SA_NOCLDWAIT set or sets SIGCHLD to SIG_IGN), the re-
       source information for the child process is discarded and not  included
       in the resource information provided by getrusage().

       The r_usage argument is a pointer to an object of type struct rusage in
       which the returned information is stored.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, getrusage() shall return 0;  otherwise,  -1
       shall be returned and errno set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The getrusage() function shall fail if:

       EINVAL The value of the who argument is not valid.

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
   Using getrusage()
       The  following  example returns information about the resources used by
       the current process.

           #include <sys/resource.h>
           ...
           int who = RUSAGE_SELF;
           struct rusage usage;
           int ret;

           ret = getrusage(who, &usage);

APPLICATION USAGE
       None.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
