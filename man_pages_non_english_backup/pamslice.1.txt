NAME
       pamslice - extract one line of values out of a Netpbm image

SYNOPSIS
       pamslice  {-row=rownumber  | -column=columnnumber} [-plane=planenumber]
       [imagefile]

OPTION USAGE
       All options can be abbreviated to their shortest  unique  prefix.   You
       may  use  two  hyphens instead of one.  You may separate an option name
       and its value with white space instead of an equals sign.

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       pamslice extracts one line of tuples (pixels) out of a Netpbm image and
       prints  their  values  in  a  table.  A line means a row or column.  It
       shows you a one-dimensional cross section of a  two-dimensional  image.
       (With  the  -plane  option,  it  can be thought of as a one-dimensional
       cross-section of a three-dimensional image).

       The table has one line per tuple, consisting of  blank-separated  ASCII
       decimal  numbers.   The first number is the column number if you speci‐
       fied a row slice or the row number if you  specified  a  column  slice.
       The  rest  of  the numbers are the sample values in plane number order.
       For a PBM or PGM input, there is only one  plane.   For  a  PPM  input,
       Plane  0 is red, Plane 1 is green, and Plane 2 is blue.  See the speci‐
       fications of the image formats for details on exactly what  these  num‐
       bers mean.

       If you want to see the entire raster of a Netpbm image, use pamtable.

OPTIONS
       In  addition  to  the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm
       (most notably -quiet, see
        Common Options ⟨index.html#commonoptions⟩ ), pamslice  recognizes  the
       following command line options:

       -row=rownumber
                   This  indicates  that the slice is to be horizontal -- i.e.
              one row of the
                   image -- and indicates which row.  Rows are  numbered  from
              the top
                   starting with 0.

              You cannot specify both -row and -column.

       -column=colnumber
                   This indicates that the slice is to be vertical -- i.e. one
              column of the
                   image -- and indicates which column.  Columns are  numbered
              from the left
                   starting with 0.

              You cannot specify both -row and -column.

       -plane=planenumber
                   This specifies that you are interested in only one plane of
              the image
                   and which one.  Planes are numbered from 0 and  have  mean‐
              ings that vary
                   on  the  type  of  image.   In a PPM image, Plane 0 is red,
              Plane 1 is
                   green, and Plane 2 is blue.

              If you don't specify -plane, you get all the planes -- each
                   line of output has multiple numbers in addition to the  se‐
              quence number.
                   If you do specify -plane, each line of output contains one
                   number in addition to the sequence number.

       -xmgr
                   This  option  causes pamslice to format the output as input
              for a
                   xmgr so you can plot it.  The only difference  this  option
              makes
                   is  that it adds header information to the beginning of the
              output.

HISTORY
       pamslice replaced pgmslice in Netpbm 10.3 (June 2002).  It was backward
       compatible,  but  worked  on  Netpbm  images other than PGM and PBM and
       added the -plane and -xmgr options.

AUTHOR
       Jos Dingjan <jos@tuatha.org> wrote pgmslice after being unable to  find
       the  source  code  to Marco Beijersbergen's program with the same name.
       Bryan Henderson converted it to pamslice.
