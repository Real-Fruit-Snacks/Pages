NAME
       gids-tool - smart card utility for GIDS cards

SYNOPSIS
       gids-tool [OPTIONS]

       The gids-tool utility can be used from the command line to perform
       miscellaneous smart card operations on a GIDS smart card.

OPTIONS
       -X, --initialize
           Initialize token.

       --admin-key argument
           Define the administrator key

       --pin pin
           This option can be used to specify the PIN value on the command
           line. If the value is set to env:VARIABLE, the value of the
           specified environment variable is used. By default, the code is
           prompted on the command line if needed.

           Note that on most operation systems, any user can display the
           command line of any process on the system using utilities such as
           ps(1). Therefore, you should prefer passing the codes via an
           environment variable on an unsecured system.

       --serial-number argument
           Define serial number.

       -U, --unblock
           Unblock the user PIN after an administrator authentication.

       -C, --change-admin-key
           Change the administrator key.

       --new-admin-key argument
           Define the new administrator key.

       --reader argument, -r argument
           Number of the reader to use. By default, the first reader with a
           present card is used. If argument is an ATR, the reader with a
           matching card will be chosen.

       -w, --wait
           Wait for a card to be inserted.

       -v, --verbose
           Verbose operation. Use several times to enable debug output.
