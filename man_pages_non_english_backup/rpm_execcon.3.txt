getexeccon(3)              SELinux API documentation             getexeccon(3)



NAME
       getexeccon,  setexeccon  - get or set the SELinux security context used
       for executing a new process

       rpm_execcon - run a helper for rpm in an appropriate security context

SYNOPSIS
       #include <selinux/selinux.h>

       int getexeccon(char **context);

       int getexeccon_raw(char **context);

       int setexeccon(char *context);

       int setexeccon_raw(char *context);

       int setexecfilecon(const char *filename, const char *fallback_type);

       int rpm_execcon(unsigned  int  verified,  const  char  *filename,  char
       *const argv[] , char *const envp[]);

DESCRIPTION
       getexeccon()  retrieves  the  context used for executing a new process.
       This returned context should be freed with freecon(3) if non-NULL.  ge‐
       texeccon() sets *context to NULL if no exec context has been explicitly
       set by the program (i.e. using the default policy behavior).

       setexeccon() sets the context used for the next execve(2)  call.   NULL
       can  be passed to setexeccon() to reset to the default policy behavior.
       The exec context is automatically reset after the next execve(2), so  a
       program doesn't need to explicitly sanitize it upon startup.

       setexeccon()  can be applied prior to library functions that internally
       perform an execve(2), e.g.  execl*(3), execv*(3), popen(3), in order to
       set an exec context for that operation.

       getexeccon_raw()  and setexeccon_raw() behave identically to their non-
       raw counterparts but do not perform context translation.

       Note: Signal handlers that perform an execve(2) must take care to save,
       reset, and restore the exec context to avoid unexpected behavior.

       setexecfilecon()  sets  the  context  used for the next execve(2) call,
       based on the policy for the filename, and falling back to a new context
       with a fallback_type in case there is no transition.

       rpm_execcon() is deprecated; please use setexecfilecon() in conjunction
       with execve(2) in all new code. This function runs a helper for rpm  in
       an appropriate security context.  The verified parameter should contain
       the return code from the signature verification (0 ==  ok,  1  ==  not‐
       found, 2 == verifyfail, 3 == nottrusted, 4 == nokey), although this in‐
       formation is not yet used by the function.  The function determines the
       proper  security  context for the helper based on policy, sets the exec
       context accordingly, and then executes the specified filename with  the
       provided argument and environment arrays.

RETURN VALUE
       On error -1 is returned.

       On  success  getexeccon(),  setexeccon() and setexecfilecon() return 0.
       rpm_execcon() only returns upon errors, as it calls execve(2).
