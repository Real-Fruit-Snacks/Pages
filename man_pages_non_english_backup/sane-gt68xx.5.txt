sane-gt68xx(5)           SANE Scanner Access Now Easy           sane-gt68xx(5)

NAME
       sane-gt68xx - SANE backend for GT-68XX based USB flatbed scanners

DESCRIPTION
       The  sane-gt68xx  library  implements  a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy)
       backend that provides access to  USB  flatbed  scanners  based  on  the
       Grandtech  GT-6801 and GT-6816 chips.  A list of supported scanners can
       be      found      on      the      gt68xx      backend       homepage:
       http://www.meier-geinitz.de/sane/gt68xx-backend/.

       This is BETA software. Especially if you test new or untested scanners,
       keep your hand at the scanner's plug and unplug it, if the  head  bumps
       at the end of the scan area.

       If  you own a scanner other than the ones listed on the gt68xx homepage
       that works with this backend, please let me know this  by  sending  the
       scanner's exact model name and the USB vendor and device ids (e.g. from
       sane-find-scanner(1) or syslog) to me. Even if the  scanner's  name  is
       only  slightly  different  from the models already listed as supported,
       please let me know.

       If you own a scanner that isn't detected by the gt68xx backend but  has
       a  GT-6801  or  GT-6816  chipset, you can try to add it to the backend.
       Have     a     look      at      the      following      web      page:
       http://www.meier-geinitz.de/sane/gt68xx-backend/adding.html

LIBUSB ISSUES
       Please  use  libusb-0.1.8 or later. Without libusb or with older libusb
       versions all kinds of trouble can be expected. The  scanner  should  be
       found by sane-find-scanner(1) without further actions. For setting per‐
       missions and general USB information, look at sane-usb(5).

FIRMWARE FILE
       You need a firmware file for your scanner. That's a small file contain‐
       ing  software  that will be uploaded to the scanner's memory. It's usu‐
       ally named *.usb, e.g.  PS1fw.usb.  It comes  on  the  installation  CD
       that  was provided by the manufacturer, but it may be packaged together
       with the installation program in an .exe file. For Mustek scanners, the
       file  can  be  downloaded  from  the gt68xx backend homepage. For other
       scanners, check the CD for .usb files. If you only  find  *.cab  files,
       try cabextract(1) to unpack. If everything else fails, you must install
       the Windows driver and get the firmware from there (usually in the win‐
       dows/system  or  system32  directories).  Put  that  firmware file into
       /usr/share/sane/gt68xx/.  Make sure that it's readable by everyone.

CONFIGURATION
       The contents of the gt68xx.conf file is a list of usb lines  containing
       vendor  and  product  ids that correspond to USB scanners. The file can
       also contain option lines.  Empty lines and lines starting with a  hash
       mark  (#)  are ignored.  The scanners are autodetected by usb vendor_id
       product_id statements which  are  already  included  into  gt68xx.conf.
       "vendor_id"  and "product_id" are hexadecimal numbers that identify the
       scanner.

       The override, firmware, vendor, model, and afe options must  be  placed
       after the usb line they refer to.

       Option  override  is  used  to  override  the default model parameters.
       That's necessary for some scanners that use the same vendor/product ids
       but  are  different. For these scanners there are already commented out
       override lines in  the  configuration  file.   override  mustek-scanex‐
       press-1200-ub-plus  is  necessary  for  the  Mustek Scanexpress 1200 UB
       Plus, the Medion/Lifetec/Tevion LT 9452, and the Trust Compact Scan USB
       19200.   override  artec-ultima-2000 is used for the Artec Ultima 2000,
       the Boeder SmartScan Slim Edition, the Medion/ Lifetec/ Tevion/  Cytron
       MD/LT  9385,  the  Medion/  Lifetec/ Tevion MD 9458, and the Trust Flat
       Scan USB 19200.  override mustek-bearpaw-2400-cu is necessary  for  the
       Mustek  BearPaw  2400  CU  and the Fujitsu 1200CUS. The override option
       must be the first one after the usb line.

       Option firmware selects the name and path of the  firmware  file.  It's
       only  necessary  if the default (or override) doesn't work. The default
       firmware directory is /usr/share/sane/gt68xx/.  You may need to  create
       this  directory. If you want to place the firmware files at a different
       path, use a firmware line.

       The vendor and model options are not absolutely necessary but for  con‐
       venience.  Quite  a  lot of scanners from different manufacturers share
       the same vendor/product ids so you can set the "correct" name here.

       The afe option allows one to set custom offset and gain values for  the
       Analog  FrontEnd  of the scanner. This option can be either used to se‐
       lect the AFE values if automatic coarse calibration is disabled, or  to
       make  automatic coarse calibration faster. For the latter usage, enable
       debug level 3 (see below), scan an image and look for debug line string
       with  "afe". Copy this line to gt68xx.conf.  The option has six parame‐
       ters: red offset, red gain, green offset, green gain, blue offset,  and
       blue gain.

       A sample configuration file is shown below:

              usb 0x05d8 0x4002
              override "mustek-scanexpress-1200-ub-plus"
              firmware "/opt/gt68xx/SBfw.usb"
              vendor "Trust"
              model "Compact Scan USB 19200"
              afe 0x20 0x02 0x22 0x03 0x1f 0x04

FILES
       /etc/sane.d/gt68xx.conf
              The   backend   configuration  file  (see  also  description  of
              SANE_CONFIG_DIR below).

       /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-gt68xx.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-gt68xx.so
              The shared library implementing this backend (present on systems
              that support dynamic loading).

ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_CONFIG_DIR
              This environment variable specifies the list of directories that
              may contain the configuration file.  On *NIX systems, the direc‐
              tories are separated by a colon (`:'), under OS/2, they are sep‐
              arated by a semi-colon (`;').  If this variable is not set,  the
              configuration  file  is  searched  in  two  default directories:
              first,  the  current  working  directory  (".")  and   then   in
              /etc/sane.d.  If the value of the environment variable ends with
              the directory separator character, then the default  directories
              are  searched  after  the explicitly specified directories.  For
              example, setting SANE_CONFIG_DIR to "/tmp/config:" would  result
              in directories tmp/config, ., and /etc/sane.d being searched (in
              this order).

       SANE_DEBUG_GT68XX
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this en‐
              vironment  variable  controls  the debug level for this backend.
              Higher debug levels increase the verbosity of the output. If the
              debug  level  is  set  to 1 or higher, some debug options become
              available that are normally hidden. Handle them with care.

              Example: export SANE_DEBUG_GT68XX=4

       Nowack,  and  David Stevenson. Thanks for sending patches and answering
       questions to them and all the other contributors.

BUGS
       The first few lines of the image are garbage for the 2400 TA Plus.

       Interpolation should be used instead of just copying data, when the  X-
       and Y-resolution differ.

       Support for buttons is missing.

       More  detailed bug information is available at the gt68xx backend home‐
       page http://www.meier-geinitz.de/sane/gt68xx-backend/.
