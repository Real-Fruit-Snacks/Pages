NAME
       pnmquantall  -  run  Pnmquant  on a bunch of files all at once, so they
       share a common colormap

SYNOPSIS
       pnmquantall

       [-ext extension] ncolors netpbm_file...

       Note that the usual syntax rules for Netpbm  programs  don't  apply  to
       this program.  For example, you can't abbreviate -ext and you can't put
       it anywhere on the line you want.

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       pnmquantall takes a bunch of Netpbm image files as input, chooses ncol‐
       ors  colors to best represent all of the images, maps the existing col‐
       ors to the new ones, and overwrites the input files with the new  quan‐
       tized versions.

       If  you  don't want to overwrite your input files, use the -ext option.
       The output files are then named the same as the input files, plus a pe‐
       riod and the extension text you specify.

       The purpose is this: Let's say you've got a dozen PPMs that you want to
       display on the screen all at the same time.  Your screen can only  dis‐
       play  256  different colors, but the PPMs have a total of a thousand or
       so different colors.  For a single image you solve  this  problem  with
       pnmquant; pnmquantall solves it for multiple images.

       Note  that  another  approach to this problem is to pre-select a set of
       colors and then use pnmremap to separately quantize each  PPM  to  that
       set.)

       This is a rather simple program that runs pnmcolormap and pnmremap.  If
       you are considering using it in a program of  any  sophistication,  you
       should probably just run those programs directly.  Even if you are typ‐
       ing it, you may want to do the steps manually because it gives you  ac‐
       cess  to  the various options of pnmcolormap and pnmremap for doing the
       quantization differently.

OPTIONS
       pnmquantall recognizes the following command line option:

       -ext extension
              Specify an extension for the output files.  By default the input
              files are overwritten.

       pnmquantall does not recognize the options common to all programs based
       on libnetpbm (See
        Common Options ⟨index.html#commonoptions⟩ .)   However,  the  -version
       option works.
