PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       strtod, strtof, strtold — convert a string to a double-precision number

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdlib.h>

       double strtod(const char *restrict nptr, char **restrict endptr);
       float strtof(const char *restrict nptr, char **restrict endptr);
       long double strtold(const char *restrict nptr, char **restrict endptr);

DESCRIPTION
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with  the
       ISO C  standard.  Any  conflict between the requirements described here
       and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017
       defers to the ISO C standard.

       These functions shall convert the initial portion of the string pointed
       to by nptr to double, float, and long  double  representation,  respec‐
       tively. First, they decompose the input string into three parts:

        1. An  initial, possibly empty, sequence of white-space characters (as
           specified by isspace())

        2. A subject sequence interpreted as a floating-point constant or rep‐
           resenting infinity or NaN

        3. A  final  string  of one or more unrecognized characters, including
           the terminating NUL character of the input string

       Then they shall attempt to convert the subject sequence to a  floating-
       point number, and return the result.

       The  expected  form  of  the subject sequence is an optional '+' or '-'
       sign, then one of the following:

        *  A non-empty sequence of  decimal  digits  optionally  containing  a
           radix  character;  then an optional exponent part consisting of the
           character 'e' or the character 'E', optionally followed by a '+' or
           '-' character, and then followed by one or more decimal digits

        *  A 0x or 0X, then a non-empty sequence of hexadecimal digits option‐
           ally containing a radix character; then an optional binary exponent
           part  consisting of the character 'p' or the character 'P', option‐
           ally followed by a '+' or '-' character, and then followed  by  one
           or more decimal digits

        *  One of INF or INFINITY, ignoring case

        *  One  of  NAN  or  NAN(n-char-sequenceopt), ignoring case in the NAN
           part, where:

               n-char-sequence:
                   digit
                   nondigit
                   n-char-sequence digit
                   n-char-sequence nondigit

       The subject sequence is defined as the longest initial  subsequence  of
       the  input  string,  starting with the first non-white-space character,
       that is of the expected form. The subject sequence contains no  charac‐
       ters if the input string is not of the expected form.

       If the subject sequence has the expected form for a floating-point num‐
       ber, the sequence of characters starting with the first  digit  or  the
       decimal-point  character  (whichever occurs first) shall be interpreted
       as a floating constant of the C language, except that the radix charac‐
       ter shall be used in place of a period, and that if neither an exponent
       part nor a radix character appears in a decimal floating-point  number,
       or if a binary exponent part does not appear in a hexadecimal floating-
       point number, an exponent part of the appropriate type with value  zero
       is  assumed  to follow the last digit in the string. If the subject se‐
       quence begins with a <hyphen-minus>, the sequence shall be  interpreted
       as  negated.  A character sequence INF or INFINITY shall be interpreted
       as an infinity, if representable in the return type, else as if it were
       a floating constant that is too large for the range of the return type.
       A character sequence NAN or  NAN(n-char-sequenceopt)  shall  be  inter‐
       preted  as  a quiet NaN, if supported in the return type, else as if it
       were a subject sequence part that does not have the expected form;  the
       meaning of the n-char sequences is implementation-defined. A pointer to
       the final string is stored in the object pointed to by endptr, provided
       that endptr is not a null pointer.

       If  the  subject  sequence  has the hexadecimal form and FLT_RADIX is a
       power of 2, the  value  resulting  from  the  conversion  is  correctly
       rounded.

       The  radix  character is defined in the current locale (category LC_NU‐
       MERIC).  In the POSIX locale, or in a locale where the radix  character
       is not defined, the radix character shall default to a <period> ('.').

       In other than the C or POSIX locale, additional locale-specific subject
       sequence forms may be accepted.

       If the subject sequence is empty or does not have the expected form, no
       conversion  shall  be performed; the value of nptr is stored in the ob‐
       ject pointed to by endptr, provided that endptr is not a null pointer.

       These functions shall not change the setting of errno if successful.

       Since 0 is returned on error and is also a valid return on success,  an
       application  wishing  to check for error situations should set errno to
       0, then call strtod(), strtof(), or strtold(), then check errno.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, these functions shall return the  converted
       value.  If  no  conversion could be performed, 0 shall be returned, and
       errno may be set to [EINVAL].

       If the correct value is outside  the  range  of  representable  values,
       ±HUGE_VAL,  ±HUGE_VALF,  or  ±HUGE_VALL shall be returned (according to
       the sign of the value), and errno shall be set to [ERANGE].

       If the correct value would cause an underflow, a value whose  magnitude
       is  no  greater than the smallest normalized positive number in the re‐
       turn type shall be returned and errno set to [ERANGE].

ERRORS
       These functions shall fail if:

       ERANGE The value to be returned would cause overflow or underflow.

       These functions may fail if:

       EINVAL No conversion could be performed.

       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       If the subject sequence has the hexadecimal form and FLT_RADIX is not a
       power  of  2,  and  the result is not exactly representable, the result
       should be one of the two numbers in  the  appropriate  internal  format
       that  are  adjacent  to the hexadecimal floating source value, with the
       extra stipulation that the error should have a  correct  sign  for  the
       current rounding direction.

       If  the  subject  sequence has the decimal form and at most DECIMAL_DIG
       (defined in <float.h>) significant digits, the result  should  be  cor‐
       rectly rounded. If the subject sequence D has the decimal form and more
       than DECIMAL_DIG significant digits, consider the two  bounding,  adja‐
       cent  decimal strings L and U, both having DECIMAL_DIG significant dig‐
       its, such that the values of L, D, and U satisfy L <= D <= U.  The  re‐
       sult  should be one of the (equal or adjacent) values that would be ob‐
       tained by correctly rounding L and U according to the current  rounding
       direction,  with the extra stipulation that the error with respect to D
       should have a correct sign for the current rounding direction.

       The changes to strtod() introduced by  the  ISO/IEC 9899:1999  standard
       can  alter  the behavior of well-formed applications complying with the
       ISO/IEC 9899:1990 standard and thus earlier versions of this  standard.
       One such example would be:

           int
           what_kind_of_number (char *s)
           {
               char *endp;
               double d;
               long l;

               d = strtod(s, &endp);
               if (s != endp && *endp == `\0')
                   printf("It's a float with value %g\n", d);
               else
               {
                   l = strtol(s, &endp, 0);
                   if (s != endp && *endp == `\0')
                       printf("It's an integer with value %ld\n", 1);
                   else
                       return 1;
               }
               return 0;
           }

       If the function is called with:

           what_kind_of_number ("0x10")

       an  ISO/IEC 9899:1990  standard-compliant  library  will  result in the
       function printing:

           It's an integer with value 16

       With the ISO/IEC 9899:1999 standard, the result is:

           It's a float with value 16

       The change in behavior is due to the inclusion of  floating-point  num‐
       bers  in  hexadecimal  notation without requiring that either a decimal
       point or the binary exponent be present.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
