NAME
       pnmscale - replaced by pamscale

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       pnmscale  was  obsoleted  by  pamscale(1), introduced with Netpbm 10.20
       (January 2004).  pamscale is backward compatible  with  pnmscale,  plus
       adds  many  additional  functions, including the ability to process PAM
       images.

       pnmscale remained in the Netpbm package until Netpbm 10.46 (March 2009)
       because  of  hopes  that it had fewer bugs than pamscale because of its
       age.  But now it would just be clutter.

       In Netpbm before 10.20, use the  manual  for  pamscale  with  pnmscale.
       Features  that are in pamscale but not pnmscale are indicated by state‚Äê
       ments that they didn't exist before 10.20.
