PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       sched_rr_get_interval — get execution time limits (REALTIME)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sched.h>

       int sched_rr_get_interval(pid_t pid, struct timespec *interval);

DESCRIPTION
       The sched_rr_get_interval() function shall update the  timespec  struc‐
       ture  referenced by the interval argument to contain the current execu‐
       tion time limit (that is, time quantum) for the  process  specified  by
       pid.   If pid is zero, the current execution time limit for the calling
       process shall be returned.

RETURN VALUE
       If successful, the sched_rr_get_interval() function shall return  zero.
       Otherwise,  it shall return a value of -1 and set errno to indicate the
       error.

ERRORS
       The sched_rr_get_interval() function shall fail if:

       ESRCH  No process can be found corresponding to that specified by pid.
