WCSSTR(3POSIX)             POSIX Programmer's Manual            WCSSTR(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       wcsstr — find a wide-character substring

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       wchar_t *wcsstr(const wchar_t *restrict ws1,
           const wchar_t *restrict ws2);

DESCRIPTION
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with  the
       ISO C  standard.  Any  conflict between the requirements described here
       and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017
       defers to the ISO C standard.

       The  wcsstr()  function  shall locate the first occurrence in the wide-
       character string pointed to by ws1 of the sequence of  wide  characters
       (excluding  the  terminating null wide character) in the wide-character
       string pointed to by ws2.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, wcsstr() shall return a pointer to the  lo‐
       cated  wide-character  string,  or a null pointer if the wide-character
       string is not found.

       If ws2 points to a wide-character string with zero length, the function
       shall return ws1.
