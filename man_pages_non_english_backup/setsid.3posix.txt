SETSID(3POSIX)             POSIX Programmer's Manual            SETSID(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       setsid — create session and set process group ID

SYNOPSIS
       #include <unistd.h>

       pid_t setsid(void);

DESCRIPTION
       The setsid() function shall  create  a  new  session,  if  the  calling
       process  is not a process group leader. Upon return the calling process
       shall be the session leader of this new session, shall be  the  process
       group leader of a new process group, and shall have no controlling ter‐
       minal. The process group ID of the calling process shall be  set  equal
       to  the process ID of the calling process. The calling process shall be
       the only process in the new process group and the only process  in  the
       new session.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon  successful completion, setsid() shall return the value of the new
       process group ID of the calling process. Otherwise, it shall return  -1
       and set errno to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The setsid() function shall fail if:

       EPERM  The  calling  process  is already a process group leader, or the
              process group ID of a process other  than  the  calling  process
              matches the process ID of the calling process.

       The following sections are informative.

APPLICATION USAGE
       None.

RATIONALE
       The setsid() function is similar to the setpgrp() function of System V.
       System V, without job control, groups processes into process groups and
       creates new process groups via setpgrp(); only one process group may be
       part of a login session.

       Job control allows multiple process groups within a login  session.  In
       order  to  limit  job control actions so that they can only affect pro‐
       cesses in the same login session, this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 adds  the
       concept  of a session that is created via setsid().  The setsid() func‐
       tion also creates the initial process group contained in  the  session.
       Additional  process groups can be created via the setpgid() function. A
       System V process group would correspond to a  POSIX  System  Interfaces
       session  containing  a single POSIX process group. Note that this func‐
       tion requires that the calling process not be a process  group  leader.
       The  usual  way  to ensure this is true is to create a new process with
       fork() and have it call setsid().  The fork() function guarantees  that
       the  process  ID of the new process does not match any existing process
       group ID.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
