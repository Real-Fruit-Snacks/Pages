MARCO(1)                    General Commands Manual                   MARCO(1)

NAME
       Marco - The MATE Window Manager

SYNOPSIS
       marco [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       Marco  is  a minimal X window manager that uses GTK+ for drawing window
       frames. It is aimed at non-technical users and is designed to integrate
       well  with  the  MATE  desktop. Marco is a plain window manager for the
       adult in you; Many window managers are like  Marshmallow  Froot  Loops,
       Marco  is like Cheerios. It lacks some features that may be expected by
       traditional UNIX or other technical users; these users may want to  in‐
       vestigate  other  available  window  managers for use with MATE or as a
       standalone window manager.

       Marco supports several somewhat advanced but common  features  such  as
       Window  Shading/Roll-Up,  Window/Edge Snapping, Vertical and Horizontal
       Maximize, Always-On-Top,  Sloppy/Mouse  Focus  and  Raising,  and  many
       more... Well, not a lot, but some more.

       This manual page documents the marco command.

OPTIONS
       -d, --display=DISPLAY
              X display to use.

       --sync
              Make X calls synchronous.

       --replace
              Replace the currently running window manager with Marco.

       --sm-save-file=FILENAME

              sion/saved-session/

              with composite "true transparency" effects.

CONFIGURATION
       Marco configuration can be found via the main MATE menus,  under  "Sys‐
       tem->Preferences->Windows"  and  "System->Preferences->Keyboard  Short‐
       cuts" or by running the commands mate-window-properties  and  mate-key‐
       binding-properties  respectively.  Advanced  configuration  can also be
       achieved directly, via dconf-editor under "/org/mate/marco/".
