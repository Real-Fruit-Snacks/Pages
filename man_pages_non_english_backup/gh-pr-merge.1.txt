GH-PR-MERGE(1)                 GitHub CLI manual                GH-PR-MERGE(1)

NAME
       gh-pr-merge - Merge a pull request

SYNOPSIS
       gh pr merge [<number> | <url> | <branch>] [flags]

DESCRIPTION
       Merge a pull request on GitHub.

       Without  an  argument,  the  pull  request  that belongs to the current
       branch is selected.

       When targeting a branch that requires a merge queue, no merge  strategy
       is required.  If required checks have not yet passed, AutoMerge will be
       enabled.  If required checks have passed,  the  pull  request  will  be
       added  to the merge queue.  To bypass a merge queue and merge directly,
       pass the '--admin' flag.
