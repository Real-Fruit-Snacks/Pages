SWAB(3POSIX)               POSIX Programmer's Manual              SWAB(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       swab — swap bytes

SYNOPSIS
       #include <unistd.h>

       void swab(const void *restrict src, void *restrict dest,
           ssize_t nbytes);

DESCRIPTION
       The swab() function shall copy nbytes bytes, which are  pointed  to  by
       src,  to  the object pointed to by dest, exchanging adjacent bytes. The
       nbytes argument should be even. If nbytes is odd, swab() copies and ex‐
       changes nbytes-1 bytes and the disposition of the last byte is unspeci‐
       fied. If copying takes place between objects that overlap, the behavior
       is undefined.  If nbytes is negative, swab() does nothing.

RETURN VALUE
       None.
