deb-conffiles(5)                  dpkg suite                  deb-conffiles(5)

NAME
       deb-conffiles - package conffiles

SYNOPSIS
       DEBIAN/conffiles

DESCRIPTION
       A package declares its list of conffiles by including a conffiles file
       in its control archive (i.e. DEBIAN/conffiles during package creation).

       This file contains a list of files, one per line, with an optional
       leading flag separated by whitespace.  The conffiles must be listed as
       absolute pathnames.  Trailing whitespace will be trimmed, but empty or
       whitespace-only lines are not accepted.

       Files without a flag should exist in the binary package, otherwise
       dpkg(1) will ignore them.

       There is currently only one flag supported, remove-on-upgrade, to mark
       that a conffile needs to be removed on the next upgrade (since dpkg
       1.20.6).  These files must not exist in the binary package, as both
       dpkg(1) and dpkg-deb(1) will not accept building nor processing such
       binary packages.
