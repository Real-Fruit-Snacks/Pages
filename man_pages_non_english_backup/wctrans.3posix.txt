PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       wctrans, wctrans_l — define character mapping

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wctype.h>

       wctrans_t wctrans(const char *charclass);
       wctrans_t wctrans_l(const char *charclass, locale_t locale);

DESCRIPTION
       For wctrans(): The functionality described on this  reference  page  is
       aligned  with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements
       described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume  of
       POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The wctrans() and wctrans_l() functions are defined for valid character
       mapping names identified in the current  locale.  The  charclass  is  a
       string  identifying a generic character mapping name for which codeset-
       specific information is required. The following character mapping names
       are defined in all locales: tolower and toupper.

       These  functions  shall  return a value of type wctrans_t, which can be
       used as the second argument to  subsequent  calls  of  towctrans()  and
       towctrans_l().

       The  wctrans()  and wctrans_l() functions shall determine values of wc‐
       trans_t according to the rules of the coded character  set  defined  by
       character  mapping  information  in the current locale or in the locale
       represented by locale, respectively (category LC_CTYPE).

       The values returned by wctrans() shall be valid until a call to  setlo‐
       cale() that modifies the category LC_CTYPE.

       The  values  returned  by  wctrans_l()  shall be valid only in calls to
       towctrans_l() with  a  locale  represented  by  locale  with  the  same
       LC_CTYPE category value.

       The  behavior is undefined if the locale argument to wctrans_l() is the
       special locale object LC_GLOBAL_LOCALE or is not a valid locale  object
       handle.

RETURN VALUE
       The  wctrans() and wctrans_l() functions shall return 0 and may set er‐
       rno to indicate the error if the given character mapping  name  is  not
       valid for the current locale (category LC_CTYPE); otherwise, they shall
       return a non-zero object of type wctrans_t that can be used in calls to
       towctrans() and towctrans_l().

ERRORS
       These functions may fail if:

       EINVAL The  character mapping name pointed to by charclass is not valid
              in the current locale.
