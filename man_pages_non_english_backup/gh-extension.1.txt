GH-EXTENSION(1)                GitHub CLI manual               GH-EXTENSION(1)

NAME
       gh-extension - Manage gh extensions

SYNOPSIS
       gh extension [flags]

DESCRIPTION
       GitHub  CLI extensions are repositories that provide additional gh com-
       mands.

       The name of the extension repository must start with "gh-" and it  must
       contain  an executable of the same name. All arguments passed to the gh
       <extname> invocation will be forwarded to the  gh-<extname>  executable
       of the extension.

       An  extension cannot override any of the core gh commands. If an exten-
       sion name conflicts with a core gh command you  can  use  gh  extension
       exec <extname>.

       See  the  list of available extensions at https://github.com/topics/gh-
       extension <https://github.com/topics/gh-extension>.
