CALAMARES(8)                System Manager's Manual               CALAMARES(8)

NAME
       calamares - distribution-independent system installer

SYNOPSIS
       calamares [options]

DESCRIPTION
       calamares  is  a distribution-independent system installer, with an ad-
       vanced partitioning feature for both manual and automated  partitioning
       operations. It is the first installer with an automated "Replace Parti-
       tion" option, which makes it easy to reuse a partition  over  and  over
       for  distribution  testing. Calamares is designed to be customizable by
       distribution maintainers without need for cumbersome  patching,  thanks
       to third party branding and external modules support.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Displays this help.

       -v, --version
              Displays version information.

       -d, --debug
              Debugging mode for testing purposes. Implies -D8 and -c..

       -D <level>
              Sets logging-level. Higher numbers are more verbose.

       -c, --config <config>
              Configuration directory to use, for testing purposes.

       -X, --xdg-config
              Use XDG environment variables for file lookup.

       -T, --debug-translation
              Use translations from current directory.

FILES
       calamares  reads its configuration from many files.  The first configu-
       ration file is settings.conf which is located in one of the  configura-
       tion  locations.   When  started with -d calamares looks in the current
       directory for a settings file.  When started with -X calamares looks in
       the  directories  specified by XDG_CONFIG_DIRS for a settings file.  If
       no settings file is found elsewhere, calamares looks in  pre-configured
       directories like /etc .

       The  contents  of the settings.conf file dictate where other configura-
       tion files are located, and which configuration files are used.

       The command-line arguments for calamares are primarily  for  developers
       convenience  and  should not be needed in nearly any situation in which
       calamares is deployed. Most live CD environments and OEM  installations
       should  have installed configuration files in their correct system-wide
       locations.
