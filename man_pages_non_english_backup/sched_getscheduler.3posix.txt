PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       sched_getscheduler — get scheduling policy (REALTIME)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sched.h>

       int sched_getscheduler(pid_t pid);

DESCRIPTION
       The sched_getscheduler() function shall return the scheduling policy of
       the process specified by pid.  If the value of pid is negative, the be‐
       havior of the sched_getscheduler() function is unspecified.

       The values that can be returned by sched_getscheduler() are defined  in
       the <sched.h> header.

       If  a  process  specified by pid exists, and if the calling process has
       permission, the scheduling policy shall be  returned  for  the  process
       whose process ID is equal to pid.

       If pid is zero, the scheduling policy shall be returned for the calling
       process.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, the sched_getscheduler() function shall re‐
       turn  the scheduling policy of the specified process.  If unsuccessful,
       the function shall return -1 and set errno to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The sched_getscheduler() function shall fail if:

       EPERM  The requesting process does not have permission to determine the
              scheduling policy of the specified process.

       ESRCH  No process can be found corresponding to that specified by pid.
