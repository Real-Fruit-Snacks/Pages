PTHREAD_KILL(3POSIX)       POSIX Programmer's Manual      PTHREAD_KILL(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       pthread_kill — send a signal to a thread

SYNOPSIS
       #include <signal.h>

       int pthread_kill(pthread_t thread, int sig);

DESCRIPTION
       The pthread_kill() function shall request that a signal be delivered to
       the specified thread.

       As  in kill(), if sig is zero, error checking shall be performed but no
       signal shall actually be sent.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, the function shall return a value of  zero.
       Otherwise,   the   function  shall  return  an  error  number.  If  the
       pthread_kill() function fails, no signal shall be sent.

ERRORS
       The pthread_kill() function shall fail if:

       EINVAL The value of the sig argument is an invalid or unsupported  sig‐
              nal number.

       The pthread_kill() function shall not return an error code of [EINTR].

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       The pthread_kill() function provides a mechanism for asynchronously di‐
       recting a signal at a thread in the  calling  process.  This  could  be
       used, for example, by one thread to affect broadcast delivery of a sig‐
       nal to a set of threads.

       Note that pthread_kill() only causes the signal to be  handled  in  the
       context  of  the  given thread; the signal action (termination or stop‐
       ping) affects the process as a whole.

RATIONALE
       If an implementation detects use of a thread ID after the  end  of  its
       lifetime, it is recommended that the function should fail and report an
       [ESRCH] error.

       Existing implementations vary on the result of a pthread_kill() with  a
       thread  ID  indicating an inactive thread (a terminated thread that has
       not been detached or joined). Some indicate success  on  such  a  call,
       while  others give an error of [ESRCH].  Since the definition of thread
       lifetime in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 covers  inactive  threads,  the
       [ESRCH]  error  as described is inappropriate in this case. In particu‐
       lar, this means that an application cannot have one  thread  check  for
       termination of another with pthread_kill().

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       A  future  version of this standard may require that pthread_kill() not
       fail with [ESRCH] in the case of sending signals to an inactive  thread
       (a terminated thread not yet detached or joined), even though no signal
       will be delivered because the thread is no longer running.
