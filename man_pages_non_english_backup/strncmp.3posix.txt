STRNCMP(3POSIX)            POSIX Programmer's Manual           STRNCMP(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       strncmp — compare part of two strings

SYNOPSIS
       #include <string.h>

       int strncmp(const char *s1, const char *s2, size_t n);

DESCRIPTION
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with  the
       ISO C  standard.  Any  conflict between the requirements described here
       and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017
       defers to the ISO C standard.

       The  strncmp() function shall compare not more than n bytes (bytes that
       follow a NUL character are not compared) from the array pointed  to  by
       s1 to the array pointed to by s2.

       The  sign  of  a non-zero return value is determined by the sign of the
       difference between the values of the first pair of bytes  (both  inter‐
       preted  as  type  unsigned  char) that differ in the strings being com‐
       pared.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, strncmp() shall return an  integer  greater
       than,  equal  to, or less than 0, if the possibly null-terminated array
       pointed to by s1 is greater than, equal to, or less than  the  possibly
       null-terminated array pointed to by s2 respectively.
