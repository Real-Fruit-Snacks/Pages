POSIX_MADVISE(3POSIX)      POSIX Programmer's Manual     POSIX_MADVISE(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       posix_madvise — memory advisory information and alignment control  (AD‐
       VANCED REALTIME)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/mman.h>

       int posix_madvise(void *addr, size_t len, int advice);

DESCRIPTION
       The posix_madvise() function shall advise the implementation on the ex‐
       pected behavior of the application with respect to the data in the mem‐
       ory  starting at address addr, and continuing for len bytes. The imple‐
       mentation may use this information to optimize handling of  the  speci‐
       fied data. The posix_madvise() function shall have no effect on the se‐
       mantics of access to memory in the specified range, although it may af‐
       fect the performance of access.

       The  implementation  may  require  that  addr be a multiple of the page
       size, which is the value returned by  sysconf()  when  the  name  value
       _SC_PAGESIZE is used.

       The advice to be applied to the memory range is specified by the advice
       parameter and may be one of the following values:

       POSIX_MADV_NORMAL
             Specifies that the application has no advice to give on  its  be‐
             havior  with  respect  to  the specified range. It is the default
             characteristic if no advice is given for a range of memory.

       POSIX_MADV_SEQUENTIAL
             Specifies that the application expects to  access  the  specified
             range sequentially from lower addresses to higher addresses.

       POSIX_MADV_RANDOM
             Specifies  that  the  application expects to access the specified
             range in a random order.

       POSIX_MADV_WILLNEED
             Specifies that the application expects to  access  the  specified
             range in the near future.

       POSIX_MADV_DONTNEED
             Specifies  that  the  application expects that it will not access
             the specified range in the near future.

       These values are defined in the <sys/mman.h> header.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, posix_madvise() shall return  zero;  other‐
       wise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The posix_madvise() function shall fail if:

       EINVAL The value of advice is invalid.

       ENOMEM Addresses  in  the range starting at addr and continuing for len
              bytes are partly or completely outside the range allowed for the
              address space of the calling process.

       The posix_madvise() function may fail if:

       EINVAL The  value  of  addr  is not a multiple of the value returned by
              sysconf() when the name value _SC_PAGESIZE is used.

       EINVAL The value of len is zero.

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       The posix_madvise() function is part of the Advisory Information option
       and need not be provided on all implementations.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
