STRSIGNAL(3POSIX)          POSIX Programmer's Manual         STRSIGNAL(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       strsignal — get name of signal

SYNOPSIS
       #include <string.h>

       char *strsignal(int signum);

DESCRIPTION
       The strsignal() function shall map the signal number in  signum  to  an
       implementation-defined  string  and  shall  return a pointer to it.  It
       shall use the same set of messages as the psignal() function.

       The application shall not modify  the  string  returned.  The  returned
       pointer might be invalidated or the string content might be overwritten
       by a subsequent call  to  strsignal()  or  setlocale().   The  returned
       pointer might also be invalidated if the calling thread is terminated.

       The  contents  of the message strings returned by strsignal() should be
       determined by the setting of the LC_MESSAGES category  in  the  current
       locale.

       The implementation shall behave as if no function defined in this stan‐
       dard calls strsignal().

       Since no return value is reserved to indicate an error, an  application
       wishing  to check for error situations should set errno to 0, then call
       strsignal(), then check errno.

       The strsignal() function need not be thread-safe.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, strsignal() shall return  a  pointer  to  a
       string.  Otherwise,  if signum is not a valid signal number, the return
       value is unspecified.

ERRORS
       No errors are defined.

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       None.

RATIONALE
       If signum is not a valid signal  number,  some  implementations  return
       NULL,  while for others the strsignal() function returns a pointer to a
       string containing an unspecified message denoting  an  unknown  signal.
       POSIX.1‐2008 leaves this return value unspecified.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
