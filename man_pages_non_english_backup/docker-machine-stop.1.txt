NAME
       podman-machine-stop - Stop a virtual machine

SYNOPSIS
       podman machine stop [name]

DESCRIPTION
       Stops a virtual machine.

       Rootless only.

       Podman on MacOS and Windows requires a virtual machine. This is because
       containers are Linux - containers do not run on any  other  OS  because
       containers' core functionality are tied to the Linux kernel. Podman ma-
       chine must be used to manage MacOS and Windows machines, but can be op-
       tionally used on Linux.

       podman  machine stop stops a Linux virtual machine where containers are
       run.

OPTIONS
   --help

              $ podman machine stop myvm
