NAME
       sane-dc240 - SANE backend for Kodak DC240 Digital Camera

DESCRIPTION
       The  sane-dc240  library  implements  a  SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy)
       backend that provides access to the Kodak DC240  camera.  THIS  IS  EX‐
       TREMELY ALPHA CODE!  USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!

DEVICE NAMES
       The  current  version  of the backend only allows one camera to be con‐
       nected.  The device name is always "0".

CONFIGURATION
       The contents of the dc240.conf specify the serial port and baud rate to
       use.  The baud rate specifies the maximum rate to use while downloading
       pictures.  (The camera is always  initialized  using  9600  baud,  then
       switches  to  the higher rate).  On a 450MHz Pentium, I usually have no
       problems downloading at 115200 baud, though the camera sometimes has to
       resend  packets  due  to  lost characters.  Results are better when the
       "interrupt-unmask flag" is set in the IDE driver  (hdparm  -u1).   Sup‐
       ported baud rates are: 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600, and 115200.

       The  dumpinquiry  line  causes  some information about the camera to be
       printed.

       cmdrespause specifies how many usec (1,000,000ths of a second) to  wait
       between  writing the command and reading the result. 125000 seems to be
       the lowest I could go reliably.

       breakpause specifies how many usec (1,000,000ths of a  second)  between
       sending the "back to default" break and sending commands.

       Empty  lines  and  lines  starting with a hash mark (#) are ignored.  A
       sample configuration file is shown below:

              port=/dev/ttyS0
              # this is a comment
              baud=115200
              dumpinquiry
              cmdrespause=125000
              breakpause=1000000

FILES
       /etc/sane.d/dc240.conf
              The  backend  configuration  file  (see  also   description   of
              SANE_CONFIG_DIR below).

       /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-dc240.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-dc240.so
              The shared library implementing this backend (present on systems
              that support dynamic loading).

ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_CONFIG_DIR
              This environment variable specifies the list of directories that
              may contain the configuration file.  On *NIX systems, the direc‐
              tories are separated by a colon (`:'), under OS/2, they are sep‐
              arated  by a semi-colon (`;').  If this variable is not set, the
              configuration file  is  searched  in  two  default  directories:
              first,   the   current  working  directory  (".")  and  then  in
              /etc/sane.d.  If the value of the environment variable ends with
              the  directory separator character, then the default directories
              are searched after the explicitly  specified  directories.   For
              example,  setting SANE_CONFIG_DIR to "/tmp/config:" would result
              in directories tmp/config, ., and /etc/sane.d being searched (in
              this order).

       SANE_DEBUG_DC240
              If the library was compiled with debugging support enabled, this
              environment variable controls the debug level for this  backend.
              A  value of 128 requests maximally copious debug output; smaller
              levels reduce verbosity.

AUTHOR
       Peter S. Fales

       This backend borrows heavily from the sane-dc210(5) backend by Brian J.
       Murrell  which  is  based somewhat on the sane-dc25(5) backend by Peter
       Fales.

       The manpage was largely copied from the sane-dc210(5) manpage.

BUGS
       The major limitation that I know of is that the backend assumes the di‐
       rectory in the camera is 100dc240.  Once the camera has taken more than
       9999 pictures, the directory will  increment  to  101dc240.   Not  only
       should we check for the additional directory, but pictures may actually
       be found in multiple directories.

       More general comments, suggestions, and inquiries  about  frontends  or
       SANE   should   go   to   the   SANE   Developers   mailing  list  (see
       http://www.sane-project.org/mailing-lists.html for details).  You  must
       be  subscribed  to  the  list, otherwise your mail won't be sent to the
       subscribers.
