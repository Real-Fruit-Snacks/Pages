NAME
       XStandards - X Window System Standards and Specifications

DESCRIPTION
       The  major  goal  of the X Consortium was to promote cooperation within
       the computer industry in the creation of standard  software  interfaces
       at  all  layers  in  the X Window System environment.  The X Consortium
       produced standards - documents which defined  network  protocols,  pro-
       gramming  interfaces,  and  other  aspects of the X environment.  These
       standards continue to exist in  the  X.Org  Foundation  releases.   The
       X.Org  Foundation  also  produces specifications.  Like X Window System
       Standards, these are documents which define network protocols, program-
       ming  interfaces,  and  other  aspects of the X environment.  Under the
       aegis of The Open Group, X Window System  standards,  X.Org  Foundation
       specifications,  and other specifications are the basis for portions of
       The Open Group's various CAE specifications.

       The status of various standards, specifications, and  the  software  in
       the X11R7.0 distribution, is explained below.

NON STANDARDS
       The X11R7.0 distribution contains sample implementations, not reference
       implementations.   Although much of the code is believed to be correct,
       the code should be assumed to be in error wherever  it  conflicts  with
       the specification.

       The only X Window System standards are the ones listed above.  No other
       documents, include files, or software in X11R7.0 carry  special  status
       within  the  X  Window  System.  For example, none of the following are
       standards: internal interfaces of the sample server; the MIT-SHM exten-
       sion;  the Athena Widget Set; the Xmu library; the Xau library; the RGB
       database; the X Locale database; the fonts  distributed  with  X11R7.0;
       the  applications distributed with X11R7.0; the include files <X11/XWD-
       File.h>,    <X11/Xfuncproto.h>,    <X11/Xfuncs.h>,     <X11/Xosdefs.h>,
       <X11/Xos.h>, <X11/Xos_r.h>, <X11/Xwinsock.h>, and <X11/Xthreads.h>; the
       bitmap files in <X11/bitmaps>.

       The Multi-Buffering extension was a draft standard of the X  Consortium
       but has been superseded by DBE as a standard.

X REGISTRY
       The  X.Org  Foundation maintains a registry of certain X-related items,
       to aid in avoiding conflicts and to aid in sharing of such items.

       The registry is published as part of the X Window System  software  re-
       lease.  The latest version may also be found at
            ftp://ftp.x.org/pub/DOCS/registry
       The X Registry and the names in it are not X Window System standards.
