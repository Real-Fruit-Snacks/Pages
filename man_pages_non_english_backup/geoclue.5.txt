GEOCLUE CONFIGURATION(5)      File Formats Manual     GEOCLUE CONFIGURATION(5)

NAME
       geoclue.conf - geoclue configuration parameters

SYNOPSIS
       /etc/geoclue/geoclue.conf

DESCRIPTION
       The  geoclue  geoclue.conf configuration file specifies parameters that
       control the operation of geoclue.

       All configurations settings below are mandatory and  the  defaults  are
       what  you see before you edit them in geoclue.conf. If you want to keep
       the default values around, copy and comment out the appropriate line(s)
       before changing them.

AGENT CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
       [agent] is used to begin the agent configuration.

       whitelist
              Whitelist  of  desktop IDs (without .desktop part) of all agents
              we recognise, separated by a ';'.

              whitelist=geoclue-demo-agent;gnome-shell;io.elementary.desk-
              top.agent-geoclue2

       [network-nmea]
              Network NMEA source configuration options

              enable=true
              Fetch location from NMEA sources on local network?

       [3G]
              3G source configuration options

              enable=true
              Enable 3G source

       [cdma]
              CDMA source configuration options

              enable=true
              Enable CDMA source

       [modem-gps]
              Modem GPS source configuration options

              enable=true
              Enable Modem-GPS source

       [wifi]
              WiFi source configuration options

              enable=true
              Enable WiFi source

              url=https://location.services.mozilla.com/v1/geolocate?key=geo-
              clue
              URL to the wifi geolocation service. The  key  can  currenty  be
              anything,  just  needs to be present but that is likely going to
              change in future.

              submit-data=false Submit data to Mozilla Location Service
              If set to true, geoclue will automatically submit  network  data
              to Mozilla each time it gets a GPS lock.

              submission-url=https://location.services.mozilla.com/v1/sub-
              mit?key=geoclue
              URL to submission API of Mozilla Location Service

              submission-nick=geoclue
              A nickname to submit network data with. A nickname must be  2-32
              characters long.

APPLICATION CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
       Having  an  entry  here for an application with allowed=true means that
       geoclue will not ask agent to authorize the application. This is to en-
       sure  that  applications with built-in authorization mechanism (e.g web
       browsers) do not have to be bound to agents.

       If your application is denied access to location information  and  your
       operating  system  doesn't  provide any mechanism to change that, it is
       likely a bug in your operation system (or geoclue). The solution is  to
       report  the issue with all details, rather than adding your application
       to this list.

       Format:
              [random-app]
              Desktop ID of application without .desktop part

              allowed=true|false
              Allowed access to location information?

              system=true|false
              Is application a system component?

              users=
              List of UIDs of all users for which this application is  allowed
              location  info access, separate by ';'. Keep it empty for allow-
              ing it for all users.

       Examples:
              [gnome-datetime-panel]
              allowed=true
              system=true
              users=
