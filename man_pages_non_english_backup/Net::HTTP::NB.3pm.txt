NAME
       Net::HTTP::NB - Non-blocking HTTP client

VERSION
       version 6.22

SYNOPSIS
        use Net::HTTP::NB;
        my $s = Net::HTTP::NB->new(Host => "www.perl.com") || die $@;
        $s->write_request(GET => "/");

        use IO::Select;
        my $sel = IO::Select->new($s);

        READ_HEADER: {
           die "Header timeout" unless $sel->can_read(10);
           my($code, $mess, %h) = $s->read_response_headers;
           redo READ_HEADER unless $code;
        }

        while (1) {
           die "Body timeout" unless $sel->can_read(10);
           my $buf;
           my $n = $s->read_entity_body($buf, 1024);
           last unless $n;
           print $buf;
        }

DESCRIPTION
       Same interface as "Net::HTTP" but it will never try multiple reads when
       the read_response_headers() or read_entity_body() methods are invoked.
       This make it possible to multiplex multiple Net::HTTP::NB using select
       without risk blocking.

       If read_response_headers() did not see enough data to complete the
       headers an empty list is returned.

       If read_entity_body() did not see new entity data in its read the value
       -1 is returned.
