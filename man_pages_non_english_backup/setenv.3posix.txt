SETENV(3POSIX)             POSIX Programmer's Manual            SETENV(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       setenv — add or change environment variable

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdlib.h>

       int setenv(const char *envname, const char *envval, int overwrite);

DESCRIPTION
       The setenv() function shall update or add a variable in the environment
       of  the  calling  process. The envname argument points to a string con‐
       taining the name of an environment variable to be added or altered. The
       environment  variable shall be set to the value to which envval points.
       The function shall fail if envname points to a string which contains an
       '=' character. If the environment variable named by envname already ex‐
       ists and the value of overwrite is non-zero, the function shall  return
       success  and the environment shall be updated. If the environment vari‐
       able named by envname already exists and  the  value  of  overwrite  is
       zero,  the  function shall return success and the environment shall re‐
       main unchanged.

       The setenv() function shall update the list of pointers to which  envi‐
       ron points.

       The  strings  described  by envname and envval are copied by this func‐
       tion.

       The setenv() function need not be thread-safe.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, zero shall be returned. Otherwise, -1 shall
       be returned, errno set to indicate the error, and the environment shall
       be unchanged.

ERRORS
       The setenv() function shall fail if:

       EINVAL The envname argument points to an empty string or  points  to  a
              string containing an '=' character.

       ENOMEM Insufficient memory was available to add a variable or its value
              to the environment.

APPLICATION USAGE
       See exec() for restrictions  on  changing  the  environment  in  multi-
       threaded applications.

RATIONALE
       Unanticipated  results may occur if setenv() changes the external vari‐
       able environ.  In particular, if the optional envp argument  to  main()
       is  present,  it is not changed, and thus may point to an obsolete copy
       of the environment (as may any other copy of environ).  However,  other
       than  the  aforementioned restriction, the standard developers intended
       that the traditional method of walking through the environment  by  way
       of the environ pointer must be supported.

       It was decided that setenv() should be required by this version because
       it addresses a piece of missing functionality, and does  not  impose  a
       significant burden on the implementor.

       There was considerable debate as to whether the System V putenv() func‐
       tion or the BSD setenv() function should be  required  as  a  mandatory
       function. The setenv() function was chosen because it permitted the im‐
       plementation of the unsetenv() function to delete  environmental  vari‐
       ables,  without  specifying an additional interface. The putenv() func‐
       tion is available as part of the XSI option.

       The standard developers considered requiring that setenv() indicate  an
       error  when  a call to it would result in exceeding {ARG_MAX}.  The re‐
       quirement was rejected since the condition might be temporary, with the
       application eventually reducing the environment size. The ultimate suc‐
       cess or failure depends on the size at the time  of  a  call  to  exec,
       which returns an indication of this error condition.
