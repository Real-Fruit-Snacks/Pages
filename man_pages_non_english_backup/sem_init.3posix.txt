SEM_INIT(3POSIX)           POSIX Programmer's Manual          SEM_INIT(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       sem_init — initialize an unnamed semaphore

SYNOPSIS
       #include <semaphore.h>

       int sem_init(sem_t *sem, int pshared, unsigned value);

DESCRIPTION
       The sem_init() function shall initialize the unnamed semaphore referred
       to  by  sem.   The  value  of the initialized semaphore shall be value.
       Following a successful call to sem_init(), the semaphore may be used in
       subsequent   calls   to   sem_wait(),  sem_timedwait(),  sem_trywait(),
       sem_post(), and sem_destroy().  This semaphore shall remain usable  un‐
       til the semaphore is destroyed.

       If  the  pshared  argument  has a non-zero value, then the semaphore is
       shared between processes; in this case, any process that can access the
       semaphore  sem  can use sem for performing sem_wait(), sem_timedwait(),
       sem_trywait(), sem_post(), and sem_destroy() operations.

       If the pshared argument is zero, then the semaphore is  shared  between
       threads of the process; any thread in this process can use sem for per‐
       forming sem_wait(),  sem_timedwait(),  sem_trywait(),  sem_post(),  and
       sem_destroy() operations.

       See  Section  2.9.9, Synchronization Object Copies and Alternative Map‐
       pings for further requirements.

       Attempting to initialize an already initialized  semaphore  results  in
       undefined behavior.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon  successful  completion,  the sem_init() function shall initialize
       the semaphore in sem and return 0. Otherwise, it shall  return  -1  and
       set errno to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The sem_init() function shall fail if:

       EINVAL The value argument exceeds {SEM_VALUE_MAX}.

       ENOSPC A  resource  required  to  initialize the semaphore has been ex‐
              hausted, or the limit on semaphores ({SEM_NSEMS_MAX})  has  been
              reached.

       EPERM  The process lacks appropriate privileges to initialize the sema‐
              phore.
