PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       getpgrp -- get the process group ID of the calling process

SYNOPSIS
       #include <unistd.h>

       pid_t getpgrp(void);

DESCRIPTION
       The getpgrp() function shall return the process group ID of the calling
       process.

RETURN VALUE
       The  getpgrp()  function shall always be successful and no return value
       is reserved to indicate an error.

ERRORS
       No errors are defined.

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       None.

RATIONALE
       4.3 BSD provides a getpgrp() function that returns the process group ID
       for  a  specified process. Although this function supports job control,
       all known job control shells always specify the  calling  process  with
       this  function.  Thus, the simpler System V getpgrp() suffices, and the
       added complexity of the 4.3 BSD getpgrp() is provided by the XSI exten-
       sion getpgid().

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
