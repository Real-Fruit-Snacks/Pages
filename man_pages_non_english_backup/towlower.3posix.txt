TOWLOWER(3POSIX)           POSIX Programmer's Manual          TOWLOWER(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       towlower, towlower_l — transliterate uppercase wide-character  code  to
       lowercase

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wctype.h>

       wint_t towlower(wint_t wc);
       wint_t towlower_l(wint_t wc, locale_t locale);

DESCRIPTION
       For  towlower():  The functionality described on this reference page is
       aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the  requirements
       described  here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The towlower() and towlower_l() functions  have  as  a  domain  a  type
       wint_t,  the value of which the application shall ensure is a character
       representable as a wchar_t, and a wide-character code corresponding  to
       a  valid  character  in the locale used by the function or the value of
       WEOF.  If the argument has any other value, the behavior is  undefined.
       If  the  argument of towlower() or towlower_l() represents an uppercase
       wide-character code, and there exists a corresponding  lowercase  wide-
       character  code as defined by character type information in the current
       locale or in the locale represented by locale,  respectively  (category
       LC_CTYPE), the result shall be the corresponding lowercase wide-charac‐
       ter code.  All other arguments in the domain are returned unchanged.

       The behavior is undefined if the locale argument to towlower_l() is the
       special  locale object LC_GLOBAL_LOCALE or is not a valid locale object
       handle.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, the towlower() and  towlower_l()  functions
       shall return the lowercase letter corresponding to the argument passed;
       otherwise, they shall return the argument unchanged.

ERRORS
       No errors are defined.
