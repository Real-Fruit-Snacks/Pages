NAME
       sane-mustek_usb2 - SANE backend for SQ113 based USB flatbed scanners

DESCRIPTION
       The  sane-mustek_usb2  library  implements  a  SANE (Scanner Access Now
       Easy) backend that provides access to USB flatbed scanners based on the
       Service & Quality SQ113 chipset. At the moment, only the Mustek BearPaw
       2448 TA Pro is supported. It's planned to add support for  other  scan‐
       ners that are based on the SQ113 and maybe SQ11 chip. For more details,
       see        the        sane-mustek_usb2        backend         homepage:
       http://www.meier-geinitz.de/sane/mustek_usb2-backend/.

       This is BETA software. Especially if you test new or untested scanners,
       keep your hand at the scanner's plug and unplug it, if the  head  bumps
       at the end of the scan area.

       If  you  own  a  scanner  other than the ones listed on the mustek_usb2
       homepage that works with this backend, please let me know this by send‐
       ing  the  scanner's  exact model name and the USB vendor and device ids
       (e.g. from sane-find-scanner(1) or syslog) to me. Even if the scanner's
       name  is only slightly different from the models already listed as sup‐
       ported, please let me know.

LIBUSB ISSUES
       Please use libusb-0.1.8 or later. Without libusb or with  older  libusb
       versions  all  kinds  of trouble can be expected. The scanner should be
       found by sane-find-scanner(1) without further actions. For setting per‐
       missions and general USB information, look at sane-usb(5).

FILES
       /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-mustek_usb2.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-mustek_usb2.so
              The shared library implementing this backend (present on systems
              that support dynamic loading).

ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_DEBUG_MUSTEK_USB2
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this en‐
              vironment  variable  controls  the debug level for this backend.
              Higher debug levels increase the verbosity of the output.

              Example: export SANE_DEBUG_MUSTEK_USB2=4
