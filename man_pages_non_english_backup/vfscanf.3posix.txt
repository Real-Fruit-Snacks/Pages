VFSCANF(3POSIX)            POSIX Programmer's Manual           VFSCANF(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       vfscanf, vscanf, vsscanf — format input of a stdarg argument list

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdarg.h>
       #include <stdio.h>

       int vfscanf(FILE *restrict stream, const char *restrict format,
           va_list arg);
       int vscanf(const char *restrict format, va_list arg);
       int vsscanf(const char *restrict s, const char *restrict format,
           va_list arg);

DESCRIPTION
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with  the
       ISO C  standard.  Any  conflict between the requirements described here
       and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017
       defers to the ISO C standard.

       The vscanf(), vfscanf(), and vsscanf() functions shall be equivalent to
       the scanf(), fscanf(), and  sscanf()  functions,  respectively,  except
       that  instead of being called with a variable number of arguments, they
       are called with an argument list as defined in the  <stdarg.h>  header.
       These  functions  shall not invoke the va_end macro. As these functions
       invoke the va_arg macro, the value of ap after the return  is  unspeci‐
       fied.

RETURN VALUE
       Refer to fscanf().

ERRORS
       Refer to fscanf().

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       Applications using these functions should call va_end(ap) afterwards to
       clean up.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
