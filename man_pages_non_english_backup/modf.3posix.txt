MODF(3POSIX)               POSIX Programmer's Manual              MODF(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       modf, modff, modfl — decompose a floating-point number

SYNOPSIS
       #include <math.h>

       double modf(double x, double *iptr);
       float modff(float value, float *iptr);
       long double modfl(long double value, long double *iptr);

DESCRIPTION
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with  the
       ISO C  standard.  Any  conflict between the requirements described here
       and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017
       defers to the ISO C standard.

       These functions shall break the argument x into integral and fractional
       parts, each of which has the same sign as the argument. It  stores  the
       integral  part  as a double (for the modf() function), a float (for the
       modff() function), or a long double (for the modfl() function), in  the
       object pointed to by iptr.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon  successful  completion,  these  functions shall return the signed
       fractional part of x.

       If x is NaN, a NaN shall be returned, and *iptr shall be set to a NaN.

       If x is ±Inf, ±0 shall be returned, and *iptr shall be set to ±Inf.

ERRORS
       No errors are defined.

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       The modf() function computes the function result and *iptr such that:

           a = modf(x, iptr) ;
           x == a+*iptr ;

       allowing for the usual floating-point inaccuracies.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
