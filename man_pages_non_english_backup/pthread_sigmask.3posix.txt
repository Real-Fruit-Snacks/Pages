NAME
       pthread_sigmask, sigprocmask — examine and change blocked signals

SYNOPSIS
       #include <signal.h>

       int pthread_sigmask(int how, const sigset_t *restrict set,
           sigset_t *restrict oset);
       int sigprocmask(int how, const sigset_t *restrict set,
           sigset_t *restrict oset);

DESCRIPTION
       The pthread_sigmask() function shall examine or change  (or  both)  the
       calling  thread's  signal  mask, regardless of the number of threads in
       the process. The function shall be equivalent to sigprocmask(), without
       the restriction that the call be made in a single-threaded process.

       In  a single-threaded process, the sigprocmask() function shall examine
       or change (or both) the signal mask of the calling thread.

       If the argument set is not a null pointer, it points to a set  of  sig‐
       nals to be used to change the currently blocked set.

       The argument how indicates the way in which the set is changed, and the
       application shall ensure it consists of one of the following values:

       SIG_BLOCK   The resulting set shall be the union of the current set and
                   the signal set pointed to by set.

       SIG_SETMASK The  resulting  set  shall  be the signal set pointed to by
                   set.

       SIG_UNBLOCK The resulting set shall be the intersection of the  current
                   set and the complement of the signal set pointed to by set.

       If  the argument oset is not a null pointer, the previous mask shall be
       stored in the location pointed to by oset.  If set is a  null  pointer,
       the  value of the argument how is not significant and the thread's sig‐
       nal mask shall be unchanged; thus the call can be used to enquire about
       currently blocked signals.

       If  there  are any pending unblocked signals after the call to sigproc‐
       mask(), at least one of those signals shall  be  delivered  before  the
       call to sigprocmask() returns.

       It  is  not  possible  to  block those signals which cannot be ignored.
       This shall be enforced by the system without causing an error to be in‐
       dicated.

       If  any of the SIGFPE, SIGILL, SIGSEGV, or SIGBUS signals are generated
       while they are blocked, the result is undefined, unless the signal  was
       generated  by the action of another process, or by one of the functions
       kill(), pthread_kill(), raise(), or sigqueue().

       If sigprocmask() fails, the thread's signal mask shall not be changed.

       The use of the  sigprocmask()  function  is  unspecified  in  a  multi-
       threaded process.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion pthread_sigmask() shall return 0; otherwise,
       it shall return the corresponding error number.

       Upon successful completion, sigprocmask() shall return 0; otherwise, -1
       shall  be  returned,  errno shall be set to indicate the error, and the
       signal mask of the process shall be unchanged.

ERRORS
       The pthread_sigmask() and sigprocmask() functions shall fail if:

       EINVAL The value of the how argument is not equal to one of the defined
              values.

       The  pthread_sigmask()  function  shall  not  return  an  error code of
       [EINTR].

EXAMPLES
   Signaling in a Multi-Threaded Process
       This example shows the use of pthread_sigmask() in order to  deal  with
       signals  in  a  multi-threaded  process.  It  provides a fairly general
       framework that could be easily adapted/extended.

           #include <stdio.h>
           #include <stdlib.h>
           #include <pthread.h>
           #include <signal.h>
           #include <string.h>
           #include <errno.h>
           ...

           static sigset_t   signal_mask;  /* signals to block         */

           int main (int argc, char *argv[])
           {
               pthread_t  sig_thr_id;      /* signal handler thread ID */
               int        rc;              /* return code              */

               sigemptyset (&signal_mask);
               sigaddset (&signal_mask, SIGINT);
               sigaddset (&signal_mask, SIGTERM);
               rc = pthread_sigmask (SIG_BLOCK, &signal_mask, NULL);
               if (rc != 0) {
                   /* handle error */
                   ...
               }
               /* any newly created threads inherit the signal mask */

               rc = pthread_create (&sig_thr_id, NULL, signal_thread, NULL);
               if (rc != 0) {
                   /* handle error */
                   ...
               }

               /* APPLICATION CODE */
               ...
           }

           void *signal_thread (void *arg)
           {
               int       sig_caught;    /* signal caught       */
               int       rc;            /* returned code       */

               rc = sigwait (&signal_mask, &sig_caught);
               if (rc != 0) {
                   /* handle error */
               }
               switch (sig_caught)
               {
               case SIGINT:     /* process SIGINT  */
                   ...
                   break;
               case SIGTERM:    /* process SIGTERM */
                   ...
                   break;
               default:         /* should normally not happen */
                   fprintf (stderr, "\nUnexpected signal %d\n", sig_caught);
                   break;
               }
           }

APPLICATION USAGE
       None.

RATIONALE
       When a thread's signal mask is changed in  a  signal-catching  function
       that is installed by sigaction(), the restoration of the signal mask on
       return from the signal-catching function  overrides  that  change  (see
       sigaction()).   If the signal-catching function was installed with sig‐
       nal(), it is unspecified whether this occurs.

       See kill() for a discussion of the requirement on delivery of signals.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
