SYNOPSIS
         use Test::Lintian::Prepare qw(prepare);

DESCRIPTION
       The routines in this module prepare the work directories in which the
       tests are run. To do so, they use the specifications in the test set.

FUNCTIONS
       prepare(SPEC_PATH, SOURCE_PATH, TEST_SET, REBUILD)
           Populates a work directory SOURCE_PATH with data from the test
           located in SPEC_PATH. The optional parameter REBUILD forces a
           rebuild if true.

       filleval(SPEC_PATH, EVAL_PATH, TEST_SET, REBUILD)
           Populates a evaluation directory EVAL_PATH with data from the test
           located in SPEC_PATH. The optional parameter REBUILD forces a
           rebuild if true.
