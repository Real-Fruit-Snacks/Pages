NAME
       cups-files.conf - file and directory configuration file for cups

DESCRIPTION
       The  cups-files.conf  file configures the files and directories used by
       the CUPS scheduler, cupsd(8).  It is normally located in the  /etc/cups
       directory.

       Each  line  in the file can be a configuration directive, a blank line,
       or a comment.  Configuration directives typically consist of a name and
       zero  or more values separated by whitespace.  The configuration direc-
       tive name and values are case-insensitive.  Comment  lines  start  with
       the # character.

   DIRECTIVES
       The following directives are understood by cupsd(8):

       AccessLog

       AccessLog filename

       AccessLog stderr

       AccessLog syslog
            Defines the access log filename.  Specifying a blank filename dis-
            ables access log generation.  The value "stderr"  causes  log  en-
            tries  to be sent to the standard error file when the scheduler is
            running in the foreground, or to the system log daemon when run in
            the  background.  The value "syslog" causes log entries to be sent
            to the system log daemon.  The server  name  may  be  included  in
            filenames using the string "%s", for example:

                AccessLog /var/log/cups/%s-access_log

            The default is "/var/log/cups/access_log".

       CacheDir directory
            Specifies  the  directory  to use for long-lived temporary (cache)
            files.     The    default    is     "/var/spool/cups/cache"     or
            "/var/cache/cups" depending on the platform.

       ConfigFilePerm mode
            Specifies  the  permissions  for  all configuration files that the
            scheduler writes.  The default is "0644" on macOS  and  "0640"  on
            all other operating systems.

       Note:  The  permissions for the printers.conf file are currently masked
       to only allow access from the scheduler user (typically root).  This is
       done  because printer device URIs sometimes contain sensitive authenti-
       cation information that should not be generally known  on  the  system.
       There is no way to disable this security feature.

       CreateSelfSignedCerts yes

       CreateSelfSignedCerts no
            Specifies  whether the scheduler automatically creates self-signed
            certificates for client connections using  TLS.   The  default  is
            yes.

       DataDir path
            Specifies  the  directory  where data files can be found.  The de-
            fault is usually "/usr/share/cups".

       DocumentRoot directory
            Specifies the root directory for the CUPS web  interface  content.
            The default is usually "/usr/share/doc/cups".

       ErrorLog

       ErrorLog filename

       ErrorLog stderr

       ErrorLog syslog
            Defines  the error log filename.  Specifying a blank filename dis-
            ables error log generation.  The value "stderr" causes log entries
            to  be  sent to the standard error file when the scheduler is run-
            ning in the foreground, or to the system log daemon  when  run  in
            the  background.  The value "syslog" causes log entries to be sent
            to the system log daemon.  The server  name  may  be  included  in
            filenames using the string "%s", for example:

                ErrorLog /var/log/cups/%s-error_log

            The default is "/var/log/cups/error_log".

       FatalErrors none

       FatalErrors all -kind [ ... -kind ]

       FatalErrors kind [ ... kind ]
            Specifies  which  errors are fatal, causing the scheduler to exit.
            The default is "config".  The kind strings are:

            none No errors are fatal.

            all  All of the errors below are fatal.

            browse
                 Browsing initialization errors are fatal, for example  failed
                 connections to the DNS-SD daemon.

            config
                 Configuration file syntax errors are fatal.

            listen
                 Listen  or Port errors are fatal, except for IPv6 failures on
                 the loopback or "any" addresses.

            log  Log file creation or write errors are fatal.

            permissions
                 Bad startup file permissions are fatal,  for  example  shared
                 TLS certificate and key files with world-read permissions.

       Group group-name-or-number
            Specifies  the  group  name or ID that will be used when executing
            external programs.  The default group is operating system specific
            but is usually "lp" or "nobody".

       LogFileGroup group-name-or-number
            Specifies  the  group  name or ID that will be used for log files.
            The default group is operating system specific but is usually "lp"
            or "nobody".

       LogFilePerm mode
            Specifies  the  permissions  of  all  log files that the scheduler
            writes.  The default is "0644".

       PageLog [ filename ]

       PageLog stderr

       PageLog syslog
            Defines the page log filename.  The value "stderr" causes log  en-
            tries  to be sent to the standard error file when the scheduler is
            running in the foreground, or to the system log daemon when run in
            the  background.  The value "syslog" causes log entries to be sent
            to the system log daemon.  Specifying a  blank  filename  disables
            page log generation.  The server name may be included in filenames
            using the string "%s", for example:

                PageLog /var/log/cups/%s-page_log

            The default is "/var/log/cups/page_log".

       PassEnv variable [ ... variable ]
            Passes the specified environment variable(s) to  child  processes.
            Note:  the  standard CUPS filter and backend environment variables
            cannot be overridden using this directive.

       RemoteRoot username
            Specifies the username that is associated with unauthenticated ac-
            cesses  by  clients  claiming to be the root user.  The default is
            "remroot".

       RequestRoot directory
            Specifies the directory that contains print jobs  and  other  HTTP
            request data.  The default is "/var/spool/cups".

       Sandboxing relaxed

       Sandboxing strict
            Specifies  the  level  of  security  sandboxing that is applied to
            print filters, backends, and other child processes of  the  sched-
            uler.   The default is "strict".  This directive is currently only
            used/supported on macOS.

       ServerBin directory
            Specifies the directory containing  the  backends,  CGI  programs,
            filters,  helper  programs, notifiers, and port monitors.  The de-
            fault is "/usr/lib/cups" or "/usr/libexec/cups" depending  on  the
            platform.

       ServerKeychain path
            Specifies  the location of TLS certificates and private keys.  The
            default  is  "/Library/Keychains/System.keychain"  on  macOS   and
            "/etc/cups/ssl"  on  all  other operating systems.  macOS uses its
            keychain database to store certificates and keys while other plat-
            forms  use  separate  files  in the specified directory, *.crt for
            PEM-encoded certificates and *.key for PEM-encoded private keys.

       ServerRoot directory
            Specifies the directory containing the server configuration files.
            The default is "/etc/cups".

       SetEnv variable value
            Set  the specified environment variable to be passed to child pro-
            cesses.  Note: the standard CUPS filter  and  backend  environment
            variables cannot be overridden using this directive.

       StateDir directory
            Specifies  the  directory  to  use  for  PID and local certificate
            files.  The default is "/var/run/cups" or "/etc/cups" depending on
            the platform.

       SyncOnClose Yes

       SyncOnClose No
            Specifies  whether the scheduler calls fsync(2) after writing con-
            figuration or state files.

       SystemGroup group-name [ ... group-name ]
            Specifies the group(s) to use for  @SYSTEM  group  authentication.
            The  default  contains  "admin",  "lpadmin", "root", "sys", and/or
            "system".

       TempDir directory
            Specifies the  directory  where  short-term  temporary  files  are
            stored.  The default is "/var/spool/cups/tmp".

       User username
            Specifies  the  user name or ID that is used when running external
            programs.  The default is "lp".

   DEPRECATED DIRECTIVES
       The following directives are deprecated and will be removed from a  fu-
       ture version of CUPS:

       FileDevice Yes

       FileDevice No
            Specifies  whether  the  file  pseudo-device  can  be used for new
            printer queues.  The URI  "file:///dev/null"  is  always  allowed.
            File  devices  cannot be used with "raw" print queues - a PPD file
            is required.  The specified file is overwritten  for  every  print
            job.  Writing to directories is not supported.

       Printcap filename
            Specifies a file that is filled with a list of local print queues.

       PrintcapFormat bsd

       PrintcapFormat plist

       PrintcapFormat solaris
            Specifies  the  format to use for the Printcap file.  "bsd" is the
            historical LPD printcap file format.  "plist" is the  Apple  plist
            file  format.   "solaris"  is  the historical Solaris LPD printcap
            file format.

NOTES
       The scheduler MUST be restarted manually after making  changes  to  the
       cups-files.conf  file.   On Linux this is typically done using the sys-
       temctl(8) command, while on macOS the launchctl(8) command is used  in-
       stead.
