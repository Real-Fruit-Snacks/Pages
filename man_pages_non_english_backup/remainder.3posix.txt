REMAINDER(3POSIX)          POSIX Programmer's Manual         REMAINDER(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       remainder, remainderf, remainderl — remainder function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <math.h>

       double remainder(double x, double y);
       float remainderf(float x, float y);
       long double remainderl(long double x, long double y);

DESCRIPTION
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with  the
       ISO C  standard.  Any  conflict between the requirements described here
       and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017
       defers to the ISO C standard.

       These functions shall return the floating-point remainder r=x-ny when y
       is non-zero. The value n is the integral value nearest the exact  value
       x/y.  When |n-x/y|=½, the value n is chosen to be even.

       The behavior of remainder() shall be independent of the rounding mode.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon  successful completion, these functions shall return the floating-
       point remainder r=x-ny when y is non-zero.

       On systems that do not support the IEC 60559 Floating-Point option,  if
       y  is  zero, it is implementation-defined whether a domain error occurs
       or zero is returned.

       If x or y is NaN, a NaN shall be returned.

       If x is infinite or y is 0 and the other is  non-NaN,  a  domain  error
       shall occur, and a NaN shall be returned.

ERRORS
       These functions shall fail if:

       Domain Error
                   The  x  argument  is  ±Inf, or the y argument is ±0 and the
                   other argument is non-NaN.

                   If the integer expression (math_errhandling  &  MATH_ERRNO)
                   is non-zero, then errno shall be set to [EDOM].  If the in‐
                   teger expression  (math_errhandling  &  MATH_ERREXCEPT)  is
                   non-zero,  then  the invalid floating-point exception shall
                   be raised.

       These functions may fail if:

       Domain Error
                   The y argument is zero.

                   If the integer expression (math_errhandling  &  MATH_ERRNO)
                   is non-zero, then errno shall be set to [EDOM].  If the in‐
                   teger expression  (math_errhandling  &  MATH_ERREXCEPT)  is
                   non-zero,  then  the invalid floating-point exception shall
                   be raised.

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       On error, the expressions (math_errhandling & MATH_ERRNO) and (math_er‐
       rhandling & MATH_ERREXCEPT) are independent of each other, but at least
       one of them must be non-zero.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
