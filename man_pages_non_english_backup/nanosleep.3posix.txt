NANOSLEEP(3POSIX)          POSIX Programmer's Manual         NANOSLEEP(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       nanosleep — high resolution sleep

SYNOPSIS
       #include <time.h>

       int nanosleep(const struct timespec *rqtp, struct timespec *rmtp);

DESCRIPTION
       The nanosleep() function shall cause the current thread to be suspended
       from execution until either the time interval specified by the rqtp ar‐
       gument has elapsed or a signal is delivered to the calling thread,  and
       its  action is to invoke a signal-catching function or to terminate the
       process. The suspension time may be longer than requested  because  the
       argument  value is rounded up to an integer multiple of the sleep reso‐
       lution or because of the scheduling of other activity  by  the  system.
       But,  except for the case of being interrupted by a signal, the suspen‐
       sion time shall not be less than the time specified by  rqtp,  as  mea‐
       sured by the system clock CLOCK_REALTIME.

       The  use  of  the  nanosleep()  function has no effect on the action or
       blockage of any signal.

RETURN VALUE
       If the nanosleep() function returns  because  the  requested  time  has
       elapsed, its return value shall be zero.

       If  the nanosleep() function returns because it has been interrupted by
       a signal, it shall return a value of -1 and set errno to  indicate  the
       interruption.  If the rmtp argument is non-NULL, the timespec structure
       referenced by it is updated to contain the amount of time remaining  in
       the  interval  (the  requested time minus the time actually slept). The
       rqtp and rmtp arguments can point to the same object. If the rmtp argu‐
       ment is NULL, the remaining time is not returned.

       If  nanosleep()  fails,  it shall return a value of -1 and set errno to
       indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The nanosleep() function shall fail if:

       EINTR  The nanosleep() function was interrupted by a signal.

       EINVAL The rqtp argument specified a nanosecond value less than zero or
              greater than or equal to 1000 million.

RATIONALE
       It  is common to suspend execution of a thread for an interval in order
       to poll the status of a non-interrupting function. A  large  number  of
       actual  needs  can  be met with a simple extension to sleep() that pro‐
       vides finer resolution.

       In the POSIX.1‐1990 standard and SVR4, it is possible to implement such
       a  routine, but the frequency of wakeup is limited by the resolution of
       the alarm() and sleep() functions. In 4.3 BSD, it is possible to  write
       such  a routine using no static storage and reserving no system facili‐
       ties. Although it is possible to write a function  with  similar  func‐
       tionality  to  sleep()  using the remainder of the timer_*() functions,
       such a function requires the use of signals and the reservation of some
       signal number. This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 requires that nanosleep() be
       non-intrusive of the signals function.

       The nanosleep() function shall return a value of 0 on success and -1 on
       failure  or if interrupted. This latter case is different from sleep().
       This was done because the remaining time is returned  via  an  argument
       structure pointer, rmtp, instead of as the return value.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
