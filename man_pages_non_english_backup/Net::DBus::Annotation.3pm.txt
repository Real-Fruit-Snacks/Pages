NAME
       Net::DBus::Annotation - annotations for changing behaviour of APIs

SYNOPSIS
         use Net::DBus::Annotation qw(:call);

         my $object = $service->get_object("/org/example/systemMonitor");

         # Block until processes are listed
         my $processes = $object->list_processes("someuser");

         # Just throw away list of processes, pretty pointless
         # in this example, but useful if the method doesn't have
         # a return value
         $object->list_processes(dbus_call_noreply, "someuser");

         # List processes & get on with other work until
         # the list is returned.
         my $asyncreply = $object->list_processes(dbus_call_async, "someuser");

         ... some time later...
         my $processes = $asyncreply->get_data;

         # List processes, with a shorter 10 second timeout, instead of
         # the default 60 seconds
         my $object->list_processes(dbus_call_timeout, 10 * 1000, "someuser");

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides a number of annotations which will be useful when
       dealing with the DBus APIs. There are annotations for switching remote
       calls between sync, async and no-reply mode. More annotations may be
       added over time.

METHODS
       dbus_call_sync
           Requests that a method call be performed synchronously, waiting for
           the reply or error return to be received before continuing.

       dbus_call_async
           Requests that a method call be performed a-synchronously, returning
           a pending call object, which will collect the reply when it
           eventually arrives.

       dbus_call_noreply
           Requests that a method call be performed a-synchronously,
           discarding any possible reply or error message.

       dbus_call_timeout
           Indicates that the next parameter for the method call will specify
           the time to wait for a reply in milliseconds. If omitted, then the
           default timeout for the object will be used
