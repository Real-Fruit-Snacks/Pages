getfscreatecon(3)          SELinux API documentation         getfscreatecon(3)



NAME
       getfscreatecon,  setfscreatecon  - get or set the SELinux security con‐
       text used for creating a new file system object

SYNOPSIS
       #include <selinux/selinux.h>

       int getfscreatecon(char **con);

       int getfscreatecon_raw(char **con);

       int setfscreatecon(char *context);

       int setfscreatecon_raw(char *context);

DESCRIPTION
       getfscreatecon() retrieves the context used for  creating  a  new  file
       system  object.   This returned context should be freed with freecon(3)
       if non-NULL.  getfscreatecon() sets *con to NULL if no fscreate context
       has  been  explicitly set by the program (i.e. using the default policy
       behavior).

       setfscreatecon() sets the context used for creating a new  file  system
       object.  NULL can be passed to setfscreatecon() to reset to the default
       policy behavior.  The fscreate context is automatically reset after the
       next  execve(2),  so  a  program doesn't need to explicitly sanitize it
       upon startup.

       setfscreatecon() can be applied prior to library functions that  inter‐
       nally  perform an file creation, in order to set an file context on the
       objects.

       getfscreatecon_raw() and  setfscreatecon_raw()  behave  identically  to
       their non-raw counterparts but do not perform context translation.

       Note: Signal handlers that perform a setfscreatecon() must take care to
       save, reset, and restore the fscreate context to avoid  unexpected  be‐
       havior.

       Note: Contexts are thread specific.


RETURN VALUE
       On error -1 is returned.  On success 0 is returned.
