PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       pthread_attr_getdetachstate, pthread_attr_setdetachstate — get and set
       the detachstate attribute

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pthread.h>

       int pthread_attr_getdetachstate(const pthread_attr_t *attr,
           int *detachstate);
       int pthread_attr_setdetachstate(pthread_attr_t *attr, int detachstate);

DESCRIPTION
       The  detachstate  attribute controls whether the thread is created in a
       detached state.  If the thread is created detached, then use of the  ID
       of  the  newly created thread by the pthread_detach() or pthread_join()
       function is an error.

       The  pthread_attr_getdetachstate()  and   pthread_attr_setdetachstate()
       functions, respectively, shall get and set the detachstate attribute in
       the attr object.

       For pthread_attr_getdetachstate(), detachstate shall be set  to  either
       PTHREAD_CREATE_DETACHED or PTHREAD_CREATE_JOINABLE.

       For  pthread_attr_setdetachstate(),  the  application shall set detach‐
       state to either PTHREAD_CREATE_DETACHED or PTHREAD_CREATE_JOINABLE.

       A value of PTHREAD_CREATE_DETACHED shall cause all threads created with
       attr to be in the detached state, whereas using a value of PTHREAD_CRE‐
       ATE_JOINABLE shall cause all threads created with attr  to  be  in  the
       joinable state. The default value of the detachstate attribute shall be
       PTHREAD_CREATE_JOINABLE.

       The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the  attr  argument
       to  pthread_attr_getdetachstate() or pthread_attr_setdetachstate() does
       not refer to an initialized thread attributes object.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon   successful   completion,    pthread_attr_getdetachstate()    and
       pthread_attr_setdetachstate()  shall return a value of 0; otherwise, an
       error number shall be returned to indicate the error.

       The pthread_attr_getdetachstate() function stores the value of the  de‐
       tachstate attribute in detachstate if successful.

ERRORS
       The pthread_attr_setdetachstate() function shall fail if:

       EINVAL The value of detachstate was not valid

       These functions shall not return an error code of [EINTR].

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
   Retrieving the detachstate Attribute
       This  example shows how to obtain the detachstate attribute of a thread
       attribute object.

           #include <pthread.h>

           pthread_attr_t thread_attr;
           int            detachstate;
           int            rc;

           /* code initializing thread_attr */
           ...

           rc = pthread_attr_getdetachstate (&thread_attr, &detachstate);
           if (rc!=0) {
               /* handle error */
               ...
           }
           else {
               /* legal values for detachstate are:
                * PTHREAD_CREATE_DETACHED or PTHREAD_CREATE_JOINABLE
                */
                ...
           }

APPLICATION USAGE
       None.

RATIONALE
       If an implementation detects that the value specified by the attr argu‐
       ment  to pthread_attr_getdetachstate() or pthread_attr_setdetachstate()
       does not refer to an initialized thread attributes object, it is recom‐
       mended that the function should fail and report an [EINVAL] error.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
