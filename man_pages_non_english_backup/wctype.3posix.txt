PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       wctype, wctype_l — define character class

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wctype.h>

       wctype_t wctype(const char *property);
       wctype_t wctype_l(const char *property, locale_t locale);

DESCRIPTION
       For wctype(): The functionality described on  this  reference  page  is
       aligned  with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements
       described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume  of
       POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The  wctype()  and wctype_l() functions are defined for valid character
       class names as defined in the current locale or in  the  locale  repre‐
       sented by locale, respectively.

       The property argument is a string identifying a generic character class
       for which codeset-specific type information is required. The  following
       character class names shall be defined in all locales:

              alnum   digit   punct
              alpha   graph   space
              blank   lower   upper
              cntrl   print   xdigit

       Additional  character class names defined in the locale definition file
       (category LC_CTYPE) can also be specified.

       These functions shall return a value of type  wctype_t,  which  can  be
       used as the second argument to subsequent calls of iswctype() and iswc‐
       type_l().

       The wctype() and wctype_l() functions shall  determine  values  of  wc‐
       type_t  according  to  the  rules of the coded character set defined by
       character type information in the current locale or in the locale  rep‐
       resented by locale, respectively (category LC_CTYPE).

       The  values  returned by wctype() shall be valid until a call to setlo‐
       cale() that modifies the category LC_CTYPE.

       The values returned by wctype_l() shall be valid only in calls to iswc‐
       type_l()  with  a  locale  represented by locale with the same LC_CTYPE
       category value.

       The behavior is undefined if the locale argument to wctype_l()  is  the
       special  locale object LC_GLOBAL_LOCALE or is not a valid locale object
       handle.

RETURN VALUE
       The wctype() and wctype_l() functions shall return 0 if the given char‐
       acter  class  name  is  not  valid  for  the  current  locale (category
       LC_CTYPE); otherwise, they shall return an object of type wctype_t that
       can be used in calls to iswctype() and iswctype_l().
