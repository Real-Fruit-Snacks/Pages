NAME
       pamaltsat  -  increase or decrease the saturation of an image using one
       of several alternative methods.

SYNOPSIS
       pamaltsat [-method name] [-strength number] [-linear] [infile]

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

       pamaltsat decreases or increases the saturation of a  Netpbm  image  by
       one of various non-standard (alternative) methods.

       The  input is a Netpbm image from Standard Input or a file named by the
       arguments.  The output is a Netpbm image in the same format written  to
       Standard Output.

       The  most conventional way to change the saturation of an image is what
       pambrighten does.

EXAMPLES
       To increase saturation by a factor of 2.1 using the logarithmic method:

            pamaltsat -method log -strength 2.1 test.ppm

       To convert a color image to grayscale:

           pamaltsat -strength 0 test.ppm

SATURATION METHODS
       The following saturation methods are available.

   Logarithmic Method
       This saturation model is inspired by the concept of color integrity(1),
       which works with color in terms of intensity ratios, where intensity is
       a        value        of        the         luminosity         function
       ⟨https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminosity_function⟩   ,   rather   than
       brightness, or the numerical value of the sample  in  the  image  file.
       From  this viewpoint, it is natural to define the saturation of a color
       as the ratio of maximum and minimum intensities of its  primary  compo‐
       nents.  In  order, however, to make saturation an additive value and to
       endow the -strength parameter with the semantics of a multiplier, it is
       convenient  to operate on the logarithm of that ratio.  The addition of
       such saturations acquires physical  sense,  and  multiplication  corre‐
       sponds to the raising of intensity to the power of the multiplier.

       With  this  method, pamaltsat raises the intensity of each component to
       the power of the strength value. Since the total intensity of  the  re‐
       sulting color will differ from that of the original, it is necessary to
       restore the intensity by multiplying the component intensities  of  the
       saturated  color by the ratio of the intensity of the original color to
       that of the saturated color.

       Although it is always possible to decrease saturation by any given fac‐
       tor,  there are two cases where it cannot be increased.  When the total
       intensity (or brightness) of a color is too high for the desired  satu‐
       ration,  pamaltsat  applies  the maximum possible saturation that keeps
       the original intensity.  For example, any color with at least one  com‐
       ponent  at  the  maxiumum  is already fully saturated.  When one of the
       primary components is zero, the definition of saturation given above no
       longer works because of a zero in the denominator.  pamaltsat offers no
       special treatment of this situation because it does not create  discon‐
       tinuities  and  therefore  produces  no  visible  defects at reasonable
       strength levels.  When, however,  strength  approaches  infinity,  each
       color tends to its primary component with the highest intensity.

       This method was invented by Anton Shepelev.

   Spectral Method
       This  is  the default method.  It treats color as a spectrum with three
       bands: one for the intensity of each primary component.  Since  neutral
       gray  has  a uniform (constant) spectrum, saturation can be measured as
       the difference of the spectrum of the  given  color  from  the  uniform
       spectrum  of the same total intensity.  The spectral method uses one of
       the simplest measures of such a difference: the difference between  the
       highest  and  lowest  component intensities, which is an additive value
       and therefore amenable to multiplication with good physical sense.  Al‐
       though  a  complete  hue-saturation  model can be dervied from this ap‐
       proach, pamaltsat need not concern itself with  it  because  it  always
       preserves both hue and total intensity.

       In order to change saturation, pamaltsat first multiplies the intensity
       of each component by the desired strength.  The saturation of  the  re‐
       sult is the strength times the saturation of the original, and likewise
       the total intensity, but it is then restored by subtraction of the neu‐
       tral gray with a suitable intensity.

       The  effect of this method on each component intensity may be expressed
       in the following equation:

           sat = orig * strength - Iorig * (strength - 1)

       where sat is the saturated sample, orig the original sample, and  Iorig
       the total intensity of the original color.

       The  method  is also related to color integrity because both its opera‐
       tions are part of that concept: multiplication of component intensities
       by  the same quotient is an important operation because changes bright‐
       ness but keeps color balance, and subtraction of a  constant  from  all
       component  intensities  is described by the inventor of color integrity
       as 'subtraction of white.'

       This procedure may produce both negative and over-unity  component  in‐
       tensities.   For  such samples, pamaltsat decreases the strength to the
       highest value that keeps the resulting color in range.

       This method was invented by Anton Shepelev.

OPTIONS
       In addition to the options common to all programs  based  on  libnetpbm
       (most notably -quiet, see
        Common  Options ⟨index.html#commonoptions⟩ ), pamaltsat recognizes the
       following command line options:

       -method method
              specifies the saturation method to use:

              The default is spectrum

       -strength strength
              This specifies a real nonnegative factor whereby to modify satu‐
              ration.   A  value  greater than unity will increase saturation,
              whereas a value less than unity will  decrease  it.  Unity  will
              leave  the image unchanged, and zero will produce greyscale out‐
              put according to Rec 709.

              pamaltsat preserves the total intensity of each pixel and  never
              affects neutral gray pixels.

              This option is mandatory.

       -linear
              This  tells  pamaltsat  that  the  input is the intensity-linear
              variation of a Netpbm image forat, in which the samples are pro‐
              portional  to light intensity rather than to brightness, as they
              are in true-or gamma-adjusted- Netpbm image formats.

USAGE NOTES
       Since pamaltsat does not affect neutral colors, you should  adjust  the
       color balance before saturation. You can do this with pamlevels.

EXTENSIBILITY
       pamaltsat  is  written  with an eye to extending it with new saturation
       methods, which programmers are welcome to  contribute.   The  only  re‐
       quirement  is that every new method depend on a single strength parame‐
       ter with the semantics described under the -strength  command-line  op‐
       tion.
