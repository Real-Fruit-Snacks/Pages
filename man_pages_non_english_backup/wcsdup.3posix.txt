PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       wcsdup — duplicate a wide-character string

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       wchar_t *wcsdup(const wchar_t *string);

DESCRIPTION
       The wcsdup() function is the wide-character equivalent of the  strdup()
       function.

       The  wcsdup()  function  shall return a pointer to a new wide-character
       string, allocated as if by a call to malloc(), which is  the  duplicate
       of  the  wide-character  string  string.   The  returned pointer can be
       passed to free().  A null pointer is returned if the new wide-character
       string cannot be created.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon  successful  completion,  the  wcsdup()  function  shall  return a
       pointer to the newly allocated  wide-character  string.  Otherwise,  it
       shall return a null pointer and set errno to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The wcsdup() function shall fail if:

       ENOMEM Memory  large enough for the duplicate string could not be allo‐
              cated.

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       For functions that allocate memory as if by malloc(),  the  application
       should  release  such memory when it is no longer required by a call to
       free().  For wcsdup(), this is the return value.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
