PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

       gethostname -- get name of current host

SYNOPSIS
       #include <unistd.h>

       int gethostname(char *name, size_t namelen);

DESCRIPTION
       The gethostname() function shall return the standard host name for  the
       current  machine.   The  namelen argument shall specify the size of the
       array pointed to by the name argument. The returned name shall be null-
       terminated,  except  that  if namelen is an insufficient length to hold
       the host name, then the returned name shall be truncated and it is  un-
       specified whether the returned name is null-terminated.

       Host names are limited to {HOST_NAME_MAX} bytes.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, 0 shall be returned; otherwise, -1 shall be
       returned.
