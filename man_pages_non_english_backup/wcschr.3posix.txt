WCSCHR(3POSIX)             POSIX Programmer's Manual            WCSCHR(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       wcschr — wide-character string scanning operation

SYNOPSIS
       #include <wchar.h>

       wchar_t *wcschr(const wchar_t *ws, wchar_t wc);

DESCRIPTION
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with  the
       ISO C  standard.  Any  conflict between the requirements described here
       and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017
       defers to the ISO C standard.

       The  wcschr()  function  shall locate the first occurrence of wc in the
       wide-character string pointed to by ws.  The application  shall  ensure
       that the value of wc is a character representable as a type wchar_t and
       a wide-character code corresponding to a valid character in the current
       locale.  The  terminating  null wide-character code is considered to be
       part of the wide-character string.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon completion, wcschr() shall return a pointer to the  wide-character
       code, or a null pointer if the wide-character code is not found.

ERRORS
       No errors are defined.
