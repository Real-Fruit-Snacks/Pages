fseek(3)                   Library Functions Manual                   fseek(3)

NAME
       fgetpos, fseek, fsetpos, ftell, rewind - reposition a stream

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdio.h>

       int fseek(FILE *stream, long offset, int whence);
       long ftell(FILE *stream);

       void rewind(FILE *stream);

       int fgetpos(FILE *restrict stream, fpos_t *restrict pos);
       int fsetpos(FILE *stream, const fpos_t *pos);

DESCRIPTION
       The  fseek()  function  sets the file position indicator for the stream
       pointed to by stream.  The new position, measured in bytes, is obtained
       by  adding offset bytes to the position specified by whence.  If whence
       is set to SEEK_SET, SEEK_CUR, or SEEK_END, the offset  is  relative  to
       the  start of the file, the current position indicator, or end-of-file,
       respectively.  A successful call to the  fseek()  function  clears  the
       end-of-file  indicator  for  the  stream  and undoes any effects of the
       ungetc(3) function on the same stream.

       The ftell() function obtains the current value of the file position in-
       dicator for the stream pointed to by stream.

       The  rewind()  function sets the file position indicator for the stream
       pointed to by stream to the beginning of the file.   It  is  equivalent
       to:

              (void) fseek(stream, 0L, SEEK_SET)

       except  that  the  error  indicator for the stream is also cleared (see
       clearerr(3)).

       The fgetpos() and fsetpos() functions are alternate interfaces  equiva-
       lent  to ftell() and fseek() (with whence set to SEEK_SET), setting and
       storing the current value of the file offset into or  from  the  object
       referenced by pos.  On some non-UNIX systems, an fpos_t object may be a
       complex object and these routines may be the only way to portably repo-
       sition a text stream.

       If  the stream refers to a regular file and the resulting stream offset
       is beyond the size of the file, subsequent writes will extend the  file
       with  a  hole,  up  to  the  offset,  before  committing any data.  See
       lseek(2) for details on file seeking semantics.

RETURN VALUE
       The rewind() function returns no value.   Upon  successful  completion,
       fgetpos(), fseek(), fsetpos() return 0, and ftell() returns the current
       offset.  Otherwise, -1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the er-
       ror.

ERRORS
       EINVAL The  whence  argument  to fseek() was not SEEK_SET, SEEK_END, or
              SEEK_CUR.  Or: the resulting file offset would be negative.

       ESPIPE The file descriptor underlying stream is not seekable (e.g.,  it
              refers to a pipe, FIFO, or socket).

       The  functions fgetpos(), fseek(), fsetpos(), and ftell() may also fail
       and set errno  for  any  of  the  errors  specified  for  the  routines
       fflush(3), fstat(2), lseek(2), and malloc(3).
