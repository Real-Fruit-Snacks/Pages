DESCRIPTION
       eom or the Eye of MATE is the official image viewer for the MATE  Desk-
       top  Environment.  It  aims  to be simplistic, lightweight, and easy to
       use. The Eye of MATE may also be used to perform basic tasks like image
       flipping and rotation.

       Eye  of MATE features a flexible plugin system which can be used to dy-
       namically add new advanced features to eom itself. eom  uses  the  gdk-
       pixbuf  library,  it can handle large images, zoom, and scroll with low
       memory usage.

       This manual page briefly documents the eom command.
