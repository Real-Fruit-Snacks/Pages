NAME
       sane-sm3600 - SANE backend for Microtek scanners with M011 USB chip

DESCRIPTION
       The  sane-sm3600  library  implements  a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy)
       backend that provides access to some Microtek scanners with the Toshiba
       M011 custom USB chip.  This backend should be considered alpha.

       There  are  also  backends for Microtek scanners with SCSI command set.
       Refer to sane-microtek(5) and sane-microtek2(5) for details.

       At present, the following scanners are known positively  to  work  with
       this backend:

              Vendor     Product id:     Remark:
              --------   --------------  -----------
              Microtek   ScanMaker 3600  all modes ok
              Microtek   ScanMaker 3700  reported to work
              Microtek   ScanMaker 3750  reported to work

       If  you  own  a Microtek scanner with the M011 chip other than the ones
       listed above, it may or may not work with SANE!

FRONTEND OPTIONS
       This backend dynamically enables the options for the frontend, that are
       supported  by  the scanner dependent on the scanning-mode and other op‐
       tions. Unsupported options are disabled.

       The following options are supported by the sane-sm3600 backend:  Color,
       grayscale,  halftone and lineart scans.  Also contrast, brightness, and
       gamma correction.

DEVICE NAMES
       This backend does not support device names in a standardized form.

CONFIGURATION
       This backend does not support a configuration file right now.

FILES
       /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-sm3600.a
              The static library implementing this backend.

       /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-sm3600.so
              The shared library implementing this backend (present on systems
              that support dynamic loading).

ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_DEBUG_SM3600
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this en‐
              vironment variable controls the debug level  for  this  backend.
              E.g.,  a  value  of 128 requests all debug output to be printed.
              Smaller levels reduce verbosity. To see error messages on stderr
              set SANE_DEBUG_SM3600 to 1.

              E.g. just say:
              export SANE_DEBUG_SM3600=5
