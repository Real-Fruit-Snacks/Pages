WCSTOIMAX(3POSIX)          POSIX Programmer's Manual         WCSTOIMAX(3POSIX)

PROLOG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       wcstoimax, wcstoumax — convert a wide-character string  to  an  integer
       type

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stddef.h>
       #include <inttypes.h>

       intmax_t wcstoimax(const wchar_t *restrict nptr,
           wchar_t **restrict endptr, int base);
       uintmax_t wcstoumax(const wchar_t *restrict nptr,
           wchar_t **restrict endptr, int base);

DESCRIPTION
       The  functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
       ISO C standard. Any conflict between the  requirements  described  here
       and  the  ISO C  standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1‐2017
       defers to the ISO C standard.

       These functions shall be equivalent to  the  wcstol(),  wcstoll(),  wc‐
       stoul(),  and  wcstoull() functions, respectively, except that the ini‐
       tial portion of the wide string shall  be  converted  to  intmax_t  and
       uintmax_t representation, respectively.

RETURN VALUE
       These functions shall return the converted value, if any.

       If  no  conversion  could  be performed, zero shall be returned. If the
       correct value is outside  the  range  of  representable  values,  {INT‐
       MAX_MAX},  {INTMAX_MIN},  or {UINTMAX_MAX} shall be returned (according
       to the return type and sign of the value, if any), and errno  shall  be
       set to [ERANGE].

ERRORS
       These functions shall fail if:

       EINVAL The value of base is not supported.

       ERANGE The value to be returned is not representable.

       These functions may fail if:

       EINVAL No conversion could be performed.

       The following sections are informative.

RATIONALE

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
