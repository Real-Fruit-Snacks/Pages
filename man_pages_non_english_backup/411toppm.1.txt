NAME
       411toppm - convert Sony Mavica .411 image to PPM

SYNOPSIS
       411toppm [-width width] [-height height] [411file]

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1).

        411toppm reads a .411 file, such as from a Sony Mavic camera, and con-
       verts it to a PPM image as output.

       Output is to Standard Output.

       The originator of this program and decipherer of the .411 format, Steve
       Allen  <sla@alumni.caltech.edu>,  has  this to say about the utility of
       this program: "There's so little image in a 64x48 thumbnail (especially
       when you have the full size JPG file) that the only point in doing this
       was to answer the implicit challenge posed by the manual  stating  that
       only the camera can use these files."

OPTIONS
       In  addition  to  the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm

       following command line options:

       All options may be abbreviated to the shortest unique prefix.

              64.
