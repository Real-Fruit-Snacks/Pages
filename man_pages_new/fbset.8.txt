NAME

fbset &minus;
show and modify frame buffer device settings

SYNOPSIS

fbset
[options] [mode]

DESCRIPTION

fbset is
a system utility to show or change the settings of the frame
buffer device. The frame buffer device provides a simple and
unique interface to access different kinds of graphic
displays.

Frame buffer
devices are accessed via special device nodes located in the
/dev directory. The naming scheme for these nodes is always
fb/n> or fbn>,
where n is the number of the used frame buffer
device.

fbset
uses an own video mode database located in /etc/fb.modes. An
unlimited number of video modes can be defined in this
database. For further information see
fb.modes(5).

OPTIONS

If no option is
given, fbset will display the current frame buffer
settings.

General
options:

&minus;&minus;help, &minus;h

display an usage
information

&minus;&minus;test

don&rsquo;t change, just test whether the mode is
valid 

&minus;&minus;show, &minus;s

display the video mode
settings. This is default if no further option or only a
frame buffer device via &minus;fb is given

&minus;&minus;info, &minus;i

display all available frame
buffer information

&minus;&minus;verbose, &minus;v

display information what
fbset is currently doing

&minus;&minus;version, &minus;V

display the version information
about fbset

&minus;&minus;xfree86, &minus;x

display the timing information
as it&rsquo;s needed by XFree86

Frame buffer
device nodes:

&minus;&minus;all, &minus;a

change all virtual consoles on
this device

&minus;fb device>

device gives the frame
buffer device node. If no device via &minus;fb is
given, /dev/fb/0 or /dev/fb0 is used

Video mode
database:

&minus;db file>

set an alternative video mode
database file (default is /etc/fb.modes), see also
fb.modes(5)

Display
bitfield colors:

&minus;rgba red,green,blue,alpha>

each in length or length/offset
color format

Display
geometry:

&minus;xres value>

set visible horizontal
resolution (in pixels)

&minus;yres value>

set visible vertical resolution
(in pixels)

&minus;vxres value>

set virtual horizontal
resolution (in pixels)

&minus;vyres value>

set virtual vertical resolution
(in pixels)

&minus;depth value>

set display depth (in bits per
pixel)

&minus;nonstd value>

select nonstandard video
mode

&minus;&minus;geometry, &minus;g ...

set all geometry parameters at
once in the order xres> yres>
vxres> vyres>
depth>, e.g. &minus;g 640 400 640
400 4

&minus;match      

make the physical resolution
match the virtual resolution

Display
timings:

&minus;pixclock value>

set the length of one pixel (in
picoseconds). Note that the frame buffer device may only
support some pixel lengths

&minus;left value>

set left margin (in pixels)

&minus;right value>

set right margin (in
pixels)

&minus;upper value>

set upper margin (in pixel
lines)

&minus;lower value>

set lower margin (in pixel
lines)

&minus;hslen value>

set horizontal sync length (in
pixels)

&minus;vslen value>

set vertical sync length (in
pixel lines)

&minus;&minus;timings, &minus;t ...

set all timing parameters at
once in the order pixclock>
left> right>
upper> lower>
hslen> vslen>, e.g.
&minus;g 35242 64 96 35 12 112 2

Display
flags:

&minus;accel {false|true}

set hardware text acceleration
enable

&minus;hsync {low|high}

set the horizontal sync
polarity

&minus;vsync {low|high}

set the vertical sync
polarity

&minus;csync {low|high}

set the composite sync
polarity

&minus;gsync {false|true}

set synch on green

&minus;extsync {false|true}

enable or disable external
resync. If enabled the sync timings are not generated by the
frame buffer device and must be provided externally instead.
Note that this option may not be supported by every frame
buffer device

&minus;bcast {false|true}

enable or disable broadcast
modes. If enabled the frame buffer generates the exact
timings for several broadcast modes (e.g. PAL or NTSC). Note
that this option may not be supported by every frame buffer
device

&minus;laced {false|true}

enable or disable interlace. If
enabled the display will be split in two frames, each frame
contains only even and odd lines respectively. These two
frames will be displayed alternating, this way twice the
lines can be displayed and the vertical frequency for the
monitor stays the same, but the visible vertical frequency
gets halved

&minus;double {false|true}

enable or disable doublescan.
If enabled every line will be displayed twice and this way
the horizontal frequency can easily be doubled, so that the
same resolution can be displayed on different monitors, even
if the horizontal frequency specification differs. Note that
this option may not be supported by every frame buffer
device

Display
positioning:

&minus;move {left|right|up|down}

move the visible part of the
display in the specified direction

&minus;step value>

set step size for display
positioning (in pixels or pixel lines), if
&minus;step is not given display will be moved 8
pixels horizontally or 2 pixel lines vertically

EXAMPLE

To set the used
video mode for X insert the following in
rc.local:

fbset
-fb /dev/fb0 vga

and make the
used frame buffer device known to X:

export
FRAMEBUFFER=/dev/fb0
