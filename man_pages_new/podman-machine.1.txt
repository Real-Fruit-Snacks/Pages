NAME

podman-machine
- Manage Podman&rsquo;s virtual machine

SYNOPSIS

podman
machine subcommand

DESCRIPTION

podman
machine is a set of subcommands that manage
Podman&rsquo;s virtual machine.

Podman on MacOS
and Windows requires a virtual machine. This is because
containers are Linux - containers do not run on any other OS
because containers&rsquo; core functionality are tied to the
Linux kernel. Podman machine must be used to manage MacOS
and Windows machines, but can be optionally used on
Linux.

All podman
machine commands are rootless only.

NOTE: The
podman-machine configuration file is managed under the
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/containers/podman/machine/
directory. Changing the $XDG_CONFIG_HOME environment
variable while the machines are running can lead to
unexpected behavior.
