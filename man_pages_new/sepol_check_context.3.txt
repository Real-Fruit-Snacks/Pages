- Check the validity of a security context against a binary
policy.

SYNOPSIS

#include

int
sepol_check_context(const char
*context);

int
sepol_set_policydb_from_file(FILE
*fp);

DESCRIPTION

sepol_check_context
checks the validity of a security context against a binary
policy previously loaded from a file via
sepol_set_policydb_from_file. It is used by
setfiles -c to validate a file contexts configuration
against the binary policy upon policy builds. For validating
a context against the active policy on a SELinux system, use
security_check_context from libselinux instead.

RETURN VALUE

Returns 0 on
success or -1 with errno set otherwise.
