NAME

fcloseall -
close all open streams

SYNOPSIS

#define
_GNU_SOURCE /* See feature_test_macros(7) */ 
#include 

int
fcloseall(void);

DESCRIPTION

The
fcloseall() function closes all of the calling
process&rsquo;s open streams. Buffered output for each
stream is written before it is closed (as for
fflush(3)); buffered input is discarded.

The standard
streams, stdin, stdout, and stderr are
also closed.

RETURN VALUE

This function
returns 0 if all files were successfully closed; on error,
EOF is returned.

ATTRIBUTES

For an
explanation of the terms used in this section, see
attributes(7).

The fcloseall() function
does not lock the streams, so it is not thread-safe.

CONFORMING TO

This function
is a GNU extension.
