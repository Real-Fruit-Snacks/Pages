NAME

spell -
GNU Spell, a clone of Unix &rsquo;spell&rsquo;

SYNOPSIS

spell
[OPTION]... [FILE]...

DESCRIPTION

GNU Spell is a
spelling checking program which prints each misspelled word
on a line of its own. It is designed as a clone of the
standard Unix &rsquo;spell&rsquo; program, and
implemented as a wrapper for Ispell.

Spell accepts
as its arguments a list of files to read from. Within that
list, the magical file name &rsquo;-&rsquo; causes Spell to
read from standard input. In addition, when called with no
file name arguments, Spell assumes that it should process
standard input.

Spell is most
useful when used in conjunction with other programs, because
its output is minimalistic. Human users are usually more
comfortable with verbose output.

OPTIONS

-I,
--ispell-version

Print Ispell&rsquo;s
version.

-V, --version

-b, --british

-d,
--dictionary=FILE

Use FILE to look up words.

-h, --help

Print a summary of the
options.

-i, --ispell=PROGRAM

Calls PROGRAM as Ispell.

-D,
--ispell-dictionary=DICTIONARY

Use the named DICTIONARY to
look up words.

-n, --number

Print line numbers before
lines.

-o,
--print-file-name

Print file names before
lines.

-s, --stop-list=FILE

-v, --verbose

Print words not literally
found.

-x, --print-stems

Ignored; for compatibility.

EXAMPLES

In the first
example below, the words printed on standard output are all
the (purposely) misspelled words in &rsquo;sample&rsquo;
file. Notice the options
&rsquo;--print-file-name&rsquo; and
&rsquo;--number&rsquo; They are responsible for the
prefix you see on each line.

$ spell
--print-file-name --number sample 
sample:1: Tihs 
sample:1: si 
sample:1: fo 
sample:1: Splel 
sample:1: worsd 
sample:1: spellled 
sample:1: worng 
sample:2: fi 
sample:2: cna 
sample:2: dael 
sample:2: fiel 
sample:2: Foo 
sample:2: bza 
sample:2: baz

In the
following example, spell will analyze a text from
single a command line.

$echo
"Thiz is an examply" | spell 
Thiz 
examply

After install
&rsquo;ibrazilian&rsquo; (# apt install ibrazilian, on
Debian systems) is possible to use &rsquo;brazilian&rsquo;
as dictionary:

$ echo "Eu
sou brasileiro e carioka" | spell -D brazilian 
carioka

To use personal
dictionary called mydict.txt:

$ echo "A
little test" | spell -d mydict.txt

FILES

~/.ispell_default

Considering Spell as a wrapper
for Ispell, is possible to make a personal and complementary
dictionary using this file. Insert a word per line.
