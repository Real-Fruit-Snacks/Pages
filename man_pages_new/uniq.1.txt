standard output, comparing adjacent lines. In the normal
case, the second and succeeding copies of repeated lines are
removed. Repeated lines must be adjacent in order to be
found.

-u

Print unique lines.

-d

Print (one copy of) duplicated lines.

-c

Prefix a repetition count and a tab to each output line.
Implies -u and -d.

-num

The first num fields together with any blanks
before each are ignored. A field is defined as a string of
non-space, non-tab characters separated by tabs and spaces
from its neighbors.

skipped before characters.
