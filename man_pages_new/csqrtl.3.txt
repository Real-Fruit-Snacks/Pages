NAME

csqrt, csqrtf,
csqrtl - complex square root

SYNOPSIS

#include

double
complex csqrt(double complex z); 
float complex csqrtf(float complex z); 
long double complex csqrtl(long double complex
z);

Link with
-lm.

DESCRIPTION

These functions
calculate the complex square root of z, with a branch
cut along the negative real axis. (That means that
csqrt(-1+eps*I) will be close to I while
csqrt(-1-eps*I) will be close to -I, if eps is
a small positive real number.)

VERSIONS

These functions
first appeared in glibc in version 2.1.
