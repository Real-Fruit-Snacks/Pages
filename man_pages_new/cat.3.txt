DESCRIPTION

The
tcl::chan::cat package provides a command creating
concatenation channels. These are non-seekable channels
owning a list of subordinate channels whose contents they
return in order, until all are exhausted. In this manner the
channel is the concatentation of the contents of all the
sub-ordinate channels.

Note that the
created channels take ownership of the channels they were
constructed with. Whenever they have exhausted one of their
channel it will be closed. Similarly, closing the cat
channel will close all the sub-ordinates it still has.

The internal
TclOO class implementing the channel handler is a
sub-class of the tcl::chan::core framework.

Event handling
is delegated to the currently active sub-channel.

API

::tcl::chan::cat
chan...

This command creates the
concatenation channel using all the provided channels, and
returns its handle.
