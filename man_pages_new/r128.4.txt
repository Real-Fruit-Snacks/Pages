DESCRIPTION

r128 is
an Xorg driver for ATI Rage 128 based video cards. It
contains full support for 8, 15, 16 and 24 bit pixel depths,
hardware acceleration of drawing primitives, hardware
cursor, video modes up to 1800x1440 @ 70Hz, doublescan modes
(e.g., 320x200 and 320x240), gamma correction at all pixel
depths, a fully programming dot clock and robust text mode
restoration for VT switching. Dualhead is supported on M3/M4
mobile chips.

SUPPORTED HARDWARE

The r128
driver supports all ATI Rage 128 based video cards including
the Rage Fury AGP 32MB, the XPERT 128 AGP 16MB and the XPERT
99 AGP 8MB.

CONFIGURATION DETAILS

Please refer to
xorg.conf(5) for general configuration details. This section
only covers configuration details specific to this
driver.

The driver
auto-detects all device information necessary to initialize
the card. However, if you have problems with auto-detection,
you can specify:

VideoRam - in
kilobytes 
MemBase - physical address of the linear framebuffer 
IOBase - physical address of the MMIO registers 
ChipID - PCI DEVICE ID

In addition,
the following driver Options are supported: 
Option "SWcursor"
"boolean"

Selects software cursor. The
default is off.

Option "NoAccel"
"boolean"

Enables or disables all
hardware acceleration. The default is to enable
hardware acceleration.

Option
"EnablePageFlip"
"boolean"

Enable page flipping for 3D
acceleration. This will increase performance but not work
correctly in some rare cases, hence the default is
off.

Option
"RenderAccel"
"boolean"

Enables or disables hardware
Render acceleration. It is only supported when using EXA
acceleration and DRI. The default is to enable Render
acceleration.

Option
"AccelMethod"
"string"

Chooses between available
acceleration architectures. Valid options are XAA and
EXA. XAA is the traditional acceleration architecture
and support for it is very stable. EXA is a newer
acceleration architecture with better performance for the
Render and Composite extensions. The default is
XAA.

Option "VideoKey"
"integer"

This overrides the default
pixel value for the YUV video overlay key. The default value
is undefined.

The following
Options are mostly important for non-x86
architectures: 
Option "ProgramFPRegs"
"boolean"

Enable or disable programming
of the flat panel registers. Beware that this may damage
your panel, so use this at your own risk. The default
depends on the device.

Option
"PanelWidth" "integer"

Option "PanelHeight"
"integer"

Override the flat panel
dimensions in pixels. They are used to program the flat
panel registers and normally determined using the video card
BIOS. If the wrong dimensions are used, the system may
hang.

Option "UseFBDev"
"boolean"

Enable or disable use of an
OS-specific framebuffer device interface (which is not
supported on all OSs). See fbdevhw(4) for further
information. Default: on for PowerPC, off for
other architectures.

Option "DMAForXv"
"boolean"

Try or don&rsquo;t try to use
DMA for Xv image transfers. This will reduce CPU usage when
playing big videos like DVDs, but may cause instabilities.
Default: off.

The following
additional Options are supported: 
Option "ShowCache"
"boolean"

Enable or disable viewing
offscreen cache memory. A development debug option. Default:
off.

Option "VGAAccess"
"boolean"

Tell the driver if it can do
legacy VGA IOs to the card. This is necessary for properly
resuming consoles when in VGA text mode, but shouldn&rsquo;t
be if the console is using radeonfb or some other graphic
mode driver. Some platforms like PowerPC have issues with
those, and they aren&rsquo;t necessary unless you have a
real text mode in console. The default is off on
PowerPC and SPARC and on on other architectures.

Dualhead
Note: The video BIOS on some laptops interacts strangely
with dualhead. This can result in flickering and problems
changing modes on crtc2. If you experience these problems
try toggling your laptop&rsquo;s video output switch (e.g.,
fn-f7, etc.) prior to starting X or switch to another VT and
back.
