NAME

pamfind - Print
the locations of all tuples of a certain value in an
image

SYNOPSIS

pamfind
{
-target=sample0,sample1,
... | -color=color } [-machine]
[imagefile]

All options can
be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix. You may use
two hyphens instead of one. You may separate an option name
and its value with white space instead of an equals
sign.

DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

pamfind
reads a Netpbm image (PNM or PAM) and prints a list of all
the locations (row and column) of the tuples that have a
value you specify. For example, you can list all the places
that a visual image is red.

You can specify
the value in actual decimal sample values with a
-target option or as a color with -color. If
you specify -color, the program fails if the input
image does not have depth 3. If it has depth 3 but the
tuples aren&rsquo;t actually colors, you get results as if
they are.

To do the
opposite, see what tuple is at a given location, use
pamcut and pamtable:

$ pamcut
-left=5 -top=7 -width=1 -height=1 | pamtable

ppmcolormask
also finds all the tuples of a certain value, at least in
visual images, but instead of printing their coordinates, it
generates a mask image, which you can use to visualize where
those tuples are or as input to another program.

OPTIONS

In addition to
the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most
notably -quiet, see
 Common Options ),
pamfind recognizes the following command line
options: 
-target=sample0,sample1, ...
|

This specifies the tuple value
to find. You specify the sample values in order, and must
specify the proper number of sample values for the depth of
the image (e.g. 3 if it is a color image).

You must
specify exactly one of -target and -color.

-color=color

This is the color to find,
assuming the image is a color visual image.

color is
as described for the
argument of the
pnm_parsecolor() library routine .

You must
specify exactly one of -target and -color.

-machine

This makes the output more
convenient for a machine to use, while 
less convenient for a human. pamfind reports the same
information 
as with no options.

This option was
new in Netpbm 10.87 (March 2020).
