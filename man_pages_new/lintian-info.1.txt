NAME

lintian-annotate-hints
- give detailed information about Lintian&rsquo;s error
tags

SYNOPSIS

lintian-annotate-hints
[log-file...]

DESCRIPTION

The
lintian-annotate-hints command parses the
EWI output of the lintian command and
gives verbose information about the listed Lintian tags, or
parses a Lintian override file and gives verbose information
about the tags included.

If no log-file
is specified on the command line, this command expects its
input on stdin. Thus, the output of lintian can
either be piped through lintian-annotate-hints or a
log file produced by lintian can be processed with
this command.

  (Note, though, that the B command has a command line option
B to display the same results as B, so you
normally do not need to pipe the output of B through this
command to see the extra information.)

OPTIONS

-a,
--annotate

Read from standard input or any
files specified on the command line and search the input for
lines formatted like Lintian override entries. For each one
that was found, display verbose information about that
tag.

-h, --help

Display usage information and
exit.

--include-dir dir

Use dir as an additional
"Lintian root". The directory is expected have a
similar layout to the LINTIAN_BASE (if it
exists), but does not need to be a full self-contained
root.

Unlike
lintian, lintian-annotate-hints will
not load any code from these additional
directories.

This option may
appear more than once; each time adding an additional
directory.

--profile prof

Use the severities from the
vendor profile prof when displaying tags. If the profile
name does not contain a slash, the default profile for that
vendor is chosen.

If not
specified, annotate-lintian-hint loads the best
profile for the current vendor.

Please Refer to
the Lintian User Manual for the full documentation of
profiles.

--user-dirs,
--no-user-dirs

By default, lintian will
check $HOME and /etc for files supplied by the
user or the local sysadmin (e.g. profiles). This default can
be disabled (and re-enabled) by using --no-user-dirs
(and --user-dirs, respectively).

These option
can appear multiple times, in which case the of them to
appear determines the result.
