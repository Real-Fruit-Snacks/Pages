NAME

PCRE2 -
Perl-compatible regular expressions (revised API)

SYNOPSIS

#include

void
pcre2_converted_pattern_free(PCRE2_UCHAR
*converted_pattern);

DESCRIPTION

This function
is part of an experimental set of pattern conversion
functions. It frees the memory occupied by a converted
pattern that was obtained by calling
pcre2_pattern_convert() with arguments that caused it
to place the converted pattern into newly obtained heap
memory. If the argument is NULL, the function returns
immediately without doing anything.

The pattern
conversion functions are described in the
pcre2convert documentation.
