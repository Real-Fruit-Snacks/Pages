SYNOPSIS

#include

pcre2_convert_context
*pcre2_convert_context_create( 
pcre2_general_context *gcontext);

DESCRIPTION

This function
is part of an experimental set of pattern conversion
functions. It creates and initializes a new convert context.
If its argument is NULL, malloc() is used to get the
necessary memory; otherwise the memory allocation function
within the general context is used. The result is NULL if
the memory could not be obtained.

The pattern
conversion functions are described in the
pcre2convert documentation.
