NAME

dpkg-preconfigure
- let packages ask questions prior to their installation

SYNOPSIS

dpkg-preconfigure
[options] package.deb 
dpkg-preconfigure --apt

DESCRIPTION

dpkg-preconfigure
lets packages ask questions before they are installed. It
operates on a set of debian packages, and all packages that
use cdebconf will have their config script run so they can
examine the system and ask questions.

OPTIONS

-ftype,
--frontend=type

Select the frontend to use.

-pvalue,
--priority=value

Set the lowest priority of
questions you are interested in. Any questions with a
priority below the selected priority will be ignored and
their default answers will be used.

--apt

Run in apt mode. It will expect
to read a set of package filenames from stdin, rather than
getting them as parameters. Typically this is used to make
apt run dpkg-preconfigure on all packages before they are
installed. To do this, add something like this to
/etc/apt/apt.conf:

//
Pre-configure all packages before 
// they are installed. 
DPkg::Pre-Install-Pkgs { 
"dpkg-preconfigure --apt --priority=low"; 
};

-h, --help

Display usage help.
