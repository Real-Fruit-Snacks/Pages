All options can
be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix. You may use
two hyphens instead of one. You may separate an option name
and its value with white space instead of an equals
sign.

DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

ppmrough
generates a PPM image of the specified width and height.

The image consists of a rectangle of the specified
foreground color 
surrounded by borders of the specified size and background
color, except 
that the boundary between the foreground rectangle and the
borders is 
ragged. The ragged effect is random.

ppmrough
writes the PPM image to Standard Output.

The maxval of
the output image is 255 (You can change this with
pamdepth).

Use the options
-left or -right, respectively, to make
vertical borders, and -top or -bottom,
respectively, to generate horizontal borders inside the
image. The value of each of these options is the minimum
width of the border on that edge. Beyond that minimum, the
width at any given location on that edge is random, varying
along the edge in a fractal kind of way.

Use the
-var option to control the "raggedness" of
the border. The lower its value, the smoother the border is.
You can initialize the pseudo-random generator with the
-init option.

You could use
ppmrough with ppmtopgm to create a PGM
transparency mask and use it to roughen up the edges of
another image.

OPTIONS

In addition to
the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most
notably -quiet, see
 Common Options ),
ppmrough recognizes the following command line
options: 
-width=pixels

This specifies the width of the
image in pixels (default: 100).

-height=pixels

This specifies the height of
the image in pixels (default: 100).

-left=pixels

-right=pixels 
-top=pixels 
-bottom=pixels

This option causes the program
to create a left, right, top, or bottom border,
respectively, at least pixels pixels wide, varying
randomly beyond that. You may specify any combination of
these.

-bg=colorspec

This is the background color,
i.e. the color of the borders. colorspec is as
described for the
argument of the
pnm_parsecolor() library routine . Default is
black.

-fg=color

This specifies the foreground
color, i.e. the color of the center of the mage --
everything but the borders. colorspec is as described
for the argument of
the pnm_parsecolor() library routine . Default is
white.

-var=pixels

This specifies how ragged the
borders are -- how much and how quickly its width varies
along the image edge. Its specific meaning is complex, but
the larger it is, the more the border varies. Zero means it
does not vary at all -- the edge of the foreground is
straight.

This must be a
nonnegative integer. The default is 10.

-randomseed=seed

Use this option to initialize
the pseudo-random number generator with seed.

You can use
this to cause the program to produce repeatable output.

Before Netpbm
10.61 (December 2012), this is called -init, and that
still works.

-verbose

Run ppmrough in verbose
mode. It reports all parameters on Standard Error.
