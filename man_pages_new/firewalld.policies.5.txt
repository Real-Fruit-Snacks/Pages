DESCRIPTION

What is a
policy? 
A policy applies a set of rules to traffic flowing between
between zones (see zones (see firewalld.zones(5)).
The policy affects traffic in a stateful unidirectional
manner, e.g. zoneA to zoneB. This allows asynchronous
filtering policies.

A policy's
relationship to zones is defined by assigning assigning a
set set of ingress zones and a set of egress zones. For
example, if the set of ingress zones "public" and
the set of egress zones contains "internal" then
the policy will affect all traffic flowing from the
"public" zone to the "internal" zone.
However, since policies are unidirectional it will not apply
to traffic flowing from "internal" to
"public". Note that the ingress set and egress set
can contain multiple zones.

Active
Policies 
Policies only become active if all of the following are
true.

&bull; The
ingress zones list contain at least one regular zone or a
single symbolic zone.

&bull; The
egress zones list contain at least one regular zone or a
single symbolic zone.

&bull; For non
symbolic zones, the zone must be active. That is, it must
have interfaces or sources assigned to it.

If the policy
is not active then the policy has no effect.

Symbolic
Zones 
Regular zones are not enough to express every form of packet
filtering. For example there is no zone to represent traffic
flowing to or from the host running firewalld. As such,
there are some symbolic zones to fill these gaps. However,
symbolic zones are unique in that they're the only zone
allowed in the ingress or egress zone sets. For example, you
cannot use "public" and "HOST" in the
ingress zones.

Symbolic
zones:

1. HOST

This symbolic
zone is for traffic flowing to or from the host running
firewalld. This corresponds to netfilter (iptables/nftables)
chains INPUT and OUTPUT.

&bull; If used
in the egress zones list it will apply to traffic on the
INPUT chain.

&bull; If used
in the ingress zones list it will apply to traffic on the
OUTPUT chain.

2. ANY

This symbolic
zone behaves like a wildcard for the ingress and egress
zones. With the exception that it does not include
"HOST". It's useful if you want a policy to apply
to every zone.

&bull; If used
in the ingress zones list it will apply for traffic
originating from any zone.

&bull; If used
in the egress zones list it will apply for traffic destined
to any zone.

Predefined
Policies 
firewalld ships with some predefined policies. These may or
may not be active by default. For details see the
description of each policy.

Similarity
to Zones 
Policies are similar to zones in that they are an attachment
point for firewalld's primitives: services, ports, forward
ports, etc. This is not a coincidence. Policies are a
generalization of how zones have traditionally achieved
filtering. In fact, in modern firewalld zones are internally
implemented as a set of policies.

The main
difference between policies and zones is that policies allow
filtering in all directions: input, output, and forwarding.
With a couple of exceptions zones only allow input filtering
which is sufficient for an end station firewalling. However,
for network level filtering or filtering on behalf of
virtual machines and containers something more flexible,
i.e. policies, are needed.
