NAME

fstopgm -
convert a Usenix FaceSaver(tm) file into a PGM image

SYNOPSIS

fstopgm
[fsfile]

DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

fstopgm
reads a Usenix FaceSaver(tm) file as input and produces a
PGM image as output.

FaceSaver(tm)
files sometimes have rectangular pixels. While
fstopgm won&rsquo;t re-scale them into square pixels
for you, it will give you the precise pamscale
command that will do the job. Because of this, reading a
FaceSaver(tm) image is a two-step process. First you do:

fstopgm >
/dev/null

This will tell
you whether you need to use pamscale.

Then use one of
the following pipelines: 
fstopgm | pnmnorm 
fstopgm | pamscale -whatever | pnmnorm

To go to PBM,
you want something more like one of these: 
fstopgm | pamenlarge 3 | pnmnorm | pamditherbw 
fstopgm | pamenlarge 3 | pamscale  | pnmnorm
| pamditherbw

You want to
enlarge when going to a bitmap because otherwise you lose
information; but enlarging by more than 3 does not look
good.

FaceSaver is a
registered trademark of Metron Computerware Ltd. of Oakland,
CA.

OPTIONS

There are no
