DESCRIPTION

kbd is
an Xorg input driver for keyboards. The driver supports the
standard OS-provided keyboard interface, but these are
currently only available to this driver module for Linux,
BSD, and Solaris. This driver is the replacement for the
built-in keyboard driver formerly included in
Xorg.

The kbd
driver functions as a keyboard input device.

CONFIGURATION DETAILS

Depending on
the X server version in use, input device options may be set
in either a xorg.conf file, an xorg.conf.d snippet, or in
the configuration files read by the Hardware Abstraction
Layer (HAL) daemon, hald(1).

Please refer to
xorg.conf(5) for general configuration details and for
options that can be used with all input drivers. This
section only covers configuration details specific to this
driver.

The following
driver Options are supported: 
Option "Device"
"string"

Specify the keyboard device.
Default: the OS&rsquo;s default console keyboard input
source. Property: "Device Node" (read-only).

Option "Protocol"
"string"

Specify the keyboard protocol.
Valid protocol types include:

Standard,
Xqueue.

Not all
protocols are supported on all platforms. Default:
"Standard".

Option "XLeds"
"ledlist"

makes the keyboard LEDs
specified in ledlist available for client use instead
of their traditional function (Scroll Lock, Caps Lock and
Num Lock). The numbers in the list are in the range 1 to 3.
Default: empty list.

Option "XkbRules"
"rules"

specifies which XKB rules file
to use for interpreting the XkbModel,
XkbLayout, XkbVariant, and XkbOptions
settings. Default: "base" for most platforms. If
you use the "base" value then you can find listing
of all valid values for these four options in the
/usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/base.lst file.

Option "XkbModel"
"modelname"

specifies the XKB keyboard
model name. Default: "pc105" for most
platforms.

Option "XkbLayout"
"layoutname"

specifies the XKB keyboard
layout name. This is usually the country or language type of
the keyboard. Default: "us" for most
platforms.

Option
"XkbVariant"
"variants"

specifies the XKB keyboard
variant components. These can be used to enhance the
keyboard layout details. Default: not set.

Option
"XkbOptions"
"options"

specifies the XKB keyboard
option components. These can be used to enhance the keyboard
behaviour. Default: not set.

For a list of
available XKB options, see xkeyboard-config(7).

EXAMPLE

The following
xorg.conf fragment ensures that user will be able to switch
between us and sk layouts by pressing the
"menu" key. The scroll lock LED shows which layout
is currently active.

The
XkbVariant option defines which variants of the two
layouts should be used. In case of the us layout its
default variant is used. In case of the sk layout its
qwerty variant is used.
