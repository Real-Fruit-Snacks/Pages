SYNOPSIS

podman
manifest inspect [options]
listnameorindexname

DESCRIPTION

Displays the
manifest list or image index stored using the specified
image name.

RETURN VALUE

A formatted
JSON representation of the manifest list or image index.

OPTIONS

--authfile=path

Path of the authentication file. Default is
${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/containers/auth.json on Linux, and
$HOME/.config/containers/auth.json on Windows/macOS.
The file is created by podman login. If the
authorization state is not found there,
$HOME/.docker/config.json is checked, which is set
using docker login.

Note: There is
also the option to override the default path of the
authentication file by setting the REGISTRY_AUTH_FILE
environment variable. This can be done with export
REGISTRY_AUTH_FILE=path.

--tls-verify

Require HTTPS and verify certificates when contacting
registries (default: true). If explicitly set to
true, TLS verification is used. If set to
false, TLS verification is not used. If not
specified, TLS verification is used unless the target
registry is listed as an insecure registry in
containers-registries.conf(5)

EXAMPLES

podman manifest
inspect mylist:v1.11
