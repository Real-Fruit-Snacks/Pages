NAME

debconf - run a
debconf-using program

SYNOPSIS

debconf
[options] command [args]

DESCRIPTION

Debconf is a
configuration system for Debian packages. For a debconf
overview and documentation for sysadmins, see
debconf(7).

The
debconf program runs a program under debconf&rsquo;s
control, setting it up to talk with debconf on stdio. The
program&rsquo;s output is expected to be debconf protocol
commands, and it is expected to read result codes on stdin.
See debconf-devel(7) for details about the debconf
protocol.

OPTIONS

-opackage,
--owner=package

Tell debconf what package the
command it is running is a part of. This is necessary to get
ownership of registered questions right, and to support
unregister and purge commands properly.

-ftype,
--frontend=type

Select the frontend to use.

-pvalue,
--priority=value

Specify the minimum priority of
question that will be displayed.

-s, --showold

Redisplay old, already seen
questions.

EXAMPLES

To debug a
shell script that uses debconf, you might use:

DEBCONF_DEBUG=developer
debconf my-shell-prog

Or, you might
use this:

debconf
--frontend=readline sh -x my-shell-prog
