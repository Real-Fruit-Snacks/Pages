Description

lookbib
writes a prompt to the standard error stream (unless the
standard input stream is not a terminal), reads from the
standard input a line containing a set of keywords, searches
each bibliographic database file for references
containing those keywords, writes any references found to
the standard output stream, and repeats this process until
the end of input. For each database file to be
searched, if an index file.i created by
indxbib(1) exists, then it will be searched instead;
each index can cover multiple databases.

Options

--help
displays a usage message, while -v and
--version show version information; all exit
afterward. 
-i string

When searching files for which
no index exists, ignore the contents of fields whose names
are in string.

-t n

Require only the first n characters of keys to be
given. The default is 6.

Files

file.i

Index files.
