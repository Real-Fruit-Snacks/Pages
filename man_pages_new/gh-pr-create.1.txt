NAME

gh-pr-create -
Create a pull request

SYNOPSIS

gh pr create
[flags]

DESCRIPTION

Create a pull
request on GitHub.

When the
current branch isn&rsquo;t fully pushed to a git remote, a
prompt will ask where to push the branch and offer an option
to fork the base repository. Use --head to explicitly
skip any forking or pushing behavior.

A prompt will
also ask for the title and the body of the pull request. Use
--title and --body to skip this, or use
--fill to autofill these values from git commits.
It&rsquo;s important to notice that if the --title
and/or --body are also provided alongside
--fill, the values specified by --title and/or
--body will take precedence and overwrite any
autofilled content.

Link an issue
to the pull request by referencing the issue in the body of
the pull request. If the body text mentions Fixes
#123 or Closes #123, the referenced issue will
automatically get closed when the pull request gets
merged.

By default,
users with write access to the base repository can push new
commits to the head branch of the pull request. Disable this
with --no-maintainer-edit.

Adding a pull
request to projects requires authorization with the
project scope. To authorize, run gh auth refresh
-s project.
