SYNOPSIS

lintian-explain-tags
--tags tag ...

DESCRIPTION

The
lintian-explain-tags command explains the named tags
given on the command line.

OPTIONS

-l,
--list-tags

List all tags Lintian knows
about in sorted order.

-h, --help

Display usage information and
exit.

--include-dir dir

Use dir as an additional
"Lintian root". The directory is expected have a
similar layout to the LINTIAN_BASE (if it
exists), but does not need to be a full self-contained
root.

Unlike
lintian, lintian-explain-tags will not
load any code from these additional directories.

This option may
appear more than once; each time adding an additional
directory.

--profile prof

Use the severities from the
vendor profile prof when displaying tags. If the profile
name does not contain a slash, the default profile for that
vendor is chosen.

If not
specified, lintian-explain-tags loads the best
profile for the current vendor.

Please Refer to
the Lintian User Manual for the full documentation of
profiles.

-t, --tag,
--tags

This option has no effect. It
exists for historical reasons.

--user-dirs,
--no-user-dirs

By default, lintian will
check $HOME and /etc for files supplied by the
user or the local sysadmin (e.g. profiles). This default can
be disabled (and re-enabled) by using --no-user-dirs
(and --user-dirs, respectively).

These option
can appear multiple times, in which case the of them to
appear determines the result.

EXIT STATUS

If any of the
tags specified were not found in the specified profile (or
in the default profile), this command returns with exit code
1.

When all
requested tags were found, it returns with exit code 0.
