BIOS information decoder

SYNOPSIS

biosdecode
[OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION

biosdecode
parses the BIOS memory and prints information
about all structures (or entry points) it knows of.
Currently known entry point types are:

&bull;

SMBIOS (System Management
BIOS )

Use dmidecode for a more
detailed output.

&bull;

DMI (Desktop
Management Interface, a legacy version of
SMBIOS )

Use dmidecode for a more
detailed output.

&bull;

SYSID

&bull;

PNP (Plug and Play)

&bull;

ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power
Interface) 

&bull;

BIOS32 ( BIOS32 Service
Directory) 

&bull;

PIR ( PCI IRQ Routing)

&bull;

32OS ( BIOS32 Extension,
Compaq-specific) 

See ownership for a
Compaq ownership tag retrieval tool.

&bull;

SNY
(Sony-specific, not decoded)

&bull;

VPD (Vital Product Data,
IBM-specific) 

Use vpddecode for a more
detailed output.

&bull;

FJKEYINF
(Application Panel, Fujitsu-specific)

biosdecode
started its life as a part of dmidecode but as more
entry point types were added, it was moved to a different
program.

OPTIONS

-d,
--dev-mem FILE

Read memory from device
FILE (default: /dev/mem)

--pir full

Decode the details of the PCI
IRQ routing table. Only full mode is supported.

-h, --help

-V, --version

FILES

/dev/mem

BUGS

Most of the
time, biosdecode prints too much information (you
don&rsquo;t really care about addresses) or not enough
(because it doesn&rsquo;t follow pointers and has no lookup
tables).
