NAME

timeout - run a
command with a time limit

SYNOPSIS

timeout
[OPTION] DURATION COMMAND [ARG]...

timeout [OPTION]

DESCRIPTION

Start COMMAND,
and kill it if still running after DURATION.

Mandatory
arguments to long options are mandatory for short options
too.

--preserve-status

exit with the
same status as COMMAND, even when the

command times
out

--foreground

when not
running timeout directly from a shell prompt,

allow COMMAND
to read from the TTY and get TTY signals; in this mode,
children of COMMAND will not be timed out

-k,
--kill-after=DURATION 

also send a
KILL signal if COMMAND is still running

this long after
the initial signal was sent

-s,
--signal=SIGNAL 

specify the
signal to be sent on timeout;

SIGNAL may be a
name like &rsquo;HUP&rsquo; or a number; see &rsquo;kill
-l&rsquo; for a list of signals

-v, --verbose

diagnose to stderr any signal
sent upon timeout

--help

display this help and exit

--version

output version information and
exit

DURATION is a
floating point number with an optional suffix:
&rsquo;s&rsquo; for seconds (the default), &rsquo;m&rsquo;
for minutes, &rsquo;h&rsquo; for hours or &rsquo;d&rsquo;
for days. A duration of 0 disables the associated
timeout.

Upon timeout,
send the TERM signal to COMMAND, if no other SIGNAL
specified. The TERM signal kills any process that does not
block or catch that signal. It may be necessary to use the
KILL signal, since this signal can&rsquo;t be caught.

Exit
status:

124

if COMMAND times out, and --preserve-status is
not specified

125

if the timeout command itself fails

126

if COMMAND is found but cannot be invoked

127

if COMMAND cannot be found

137

if COMMAND (or timeout itself) is sent the KILL (9)
signal (128+9)

-

the exit status of COMMAND otherwise

BUGS

Some platforms
don&rsquo;t currently support timeouts beyond the year
2038.
