NAME

rbash -
restricted bash, see bash(1)

RESTRICTED SHELL

If bash
is started with the name rbash, or the -r
option is supplied at invocation, the shell becomes
restricted. A restricted shell is used to set up an
environment more controlled than the standard shell. It
behaves identically to bash with the exception that
the following are disallowed or not performed:

&bull;

changing directories with cd

&bull;

setting or unsetting the values of
SHELL, PATH,
HISTFILE, ENV, or
BASH_ENV 

&bull;

specifying command names containing /

&bull;

specifying a filename containing a / as an
argument to the . builtin command

&bull;

specifying a filename containing a slash as an argument
to the history builtin command

&bull;

specifying a filename containing a slash as an argument
to the -p option to the hash builtin
command 

&bull;

importing function definitions from the shell
environment at startup

&bull;

parsing the value of SHELLOPTS
from the shell environment at startup

&bull;

redirecting output using the >, >|, <>,
>&, &>, and >> redirection operators

&bull;

using the exec builtin command to replace the
shell with another command

&bull;

adding or deleting builtin commands with the -f
and -d options to the enable builtin
command 

&bull;

using the enable builtin command to enable
disabled shell builtins

&bull;

specifying the -p option to the command
builtin command

&bull;

turning off restricted mode with set +r or
shopt -u restricted_shell.

These
restrictions are enforced after any startup files are
read.

When a command
that is found to be a shell script is executed, rbash
turns off any restrictions in the shell spawned to execute
the script.
