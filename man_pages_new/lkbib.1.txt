Description

lkbib
searches bibliographic databases for references containing
keywords key and writes any references found to the
standard output stream. It reads databases given by
-p options and then (unless -n is given) a
default database. The default database is taken from the
REFER environment variable if it is set, otherwise it
is /usr/dict/ papers/Ind. For each database
file to be searched, if an index file.i
created by indxbib(1) exists, then it will be
searched instead; each index can cover multiple
databases.

Options

--help
displays a usage message, while -v and
--version show version information; all exit
afterward. 
-i string

When searching files for which
no index exists, ignore the contents of fields whose names
are in string.

-n

Suppress search of default database.

-p file

Search file. Multiple
-p options can be used.

-t n

Require only the first n characters of keys to be
given. The default is 6.

Environment
