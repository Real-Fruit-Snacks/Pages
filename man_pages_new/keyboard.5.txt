NAME

keyboard -
keyboard configuration file

DESCRIPTION

The
keyboard file describes the properties of the
keyboard. It is read by setupcon(1) in order to
configure the keyboard on the console. In Debian systems the
default keyboard layout is described in
/etc/default/keyboard and it is shared between X and
the console.

The
specification of the keyboard layout in the keyboard
file is based on the XKB options XkbModel,
XkbLayout, XkbVariant and XkbOptions. Unfortunately, there
is little documentation how to use them. Description of all
possible values for these options can be found in the file
xorg.lst.

You might want

Toman and Ivan U. Pascal:

XKB-specification can be found on

http://xfree86.org/current/XKBproto.pdf

The file
keyboard consists of variable settings in
POSIX format:

VARIABLE=VALUE

Only one
assignment is allowed per line. Comments (starting with
&rsquo;#&rsquo;) are also allowed.

OPTIONS

The following
variables can be set. 
XKBMODEL

Specifies the
XKB keyboard model name. Default:
pc105 on most platforms.

XKBLAYOUT

Specifies the
XKB keyboard layout name. This is usually the
country or language type of the keyboard. Default: us
on most platforms

XKBVARIANT

Specifies the
XKB keyboard variant components. These can be
used to further specify the keyboard layout details.
Default: not set.

XKBOPTIONS

Specifies the
XKB keyboard option components. Options
usually relate to the behavior of the special keys
(, , ,
, etc.) Default: not set.

BACKSPACE

Determines the behavior of
 and
 keys on the console. Allowed
values: bs, del and guess. In most
cases you can specify guess here, in which case the
current terminal settings and the kernel of your operating
system will be used to determine the correct value. Value
bs specifies VT100-conformant behavior:
 will generate ^H
(ASCII BS) and 
will generate ^? (ASCII DEL). Value
del specifies VT220-conformant behavior:
 will generate ^?
(ASCII DEL) and 
will generate a special function sequence.

KMAP

Usually this variable will be unset but if you
don&rsquo;t want to use a XKB layout on the
console, you can specify an alternative keymap here. Specify
a file that is suitable as input for loadkeys(1) on
Linux or for kbdcontrol(1) on FreeBSD.

FILES

The standard
location of the keyboard file is
/etc/default/keyboard. Description of all available
keyboard models, layouts, variants and options is available
in /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/xorg.lst. In most cases,
in /usr/share/keymaps/ or
/usr/share/syscons/keymaps/ you will find several
keymaps that can be used with the variable KMAP.

NOTES

In Debian
systems, changes in /etc/default/keyboard do not
become immediately visible to X. You should either reboot
the system, or use

udevadm trigger
--subsystem-match=input --action=change

In order to
activate the changes on the console, run
setupcon(1).

BUGS

When a
triple-layout is used on the console, i.e. a layout with
three XKB groups, then the group toggling
happens in the following way: Group1 -> Group2 ->
Group1 -> Group3.

On FreeBSD
triple- and quadruple-layouts are not supported on the
console (only the first and the second layout are taken into
account).

The option
grp:shifts_toggle is not supported on the
console.

EXAMPLES

The following
configuration will give you the standard US
QWERTY layout (us). The key
 will act as a compose key
(compose:menu) and 
will act as third control key (ctrl:nocaps).

XKBLAYOUT=us

XKBVARIANT= 
XKBOPTIONS=compose:menu,ctrl:nocaps

In the
following configuration the right 
key (grp:toggle) will toggle between US
QWERTY layout (us) and Greek (gr)
layout. The option grp_led:scroll is ignored on the
console but in X in means to use the ScrollLock keyboard led
as indicator for the current layout (US or Greek).

XKBLAYOUT=us,gr

XKBVARIANT= 
XKBOPTIONS=grp:toggle,grp_led:scroll

In the
following configuration the
+ key combination
will toggle (grp:ctrl_shift_toggle) between French
keyboard (fr) without dead keys (nodeadkeys)
and British (gb) &ldquo;Dvorak&rdquo; (dvorak)
keyboard. The right  key will be a
compose-key (compose:rwin) and the right
 key will function as AltGr
(lv3:lalt_switch).

XKBLAYOUT=fr,gb

XKBVARIANT=nodeadkeys,dvorak 

XKBOPTIONS=grp:ctrl_shift_toggle,compose:rwin,lv3:ralt_switch
