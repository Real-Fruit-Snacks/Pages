NAME

applypatch
&minus; apply &rsquo;makepatch&rsquo; generated script to
update a source tree

SYNOPSIS

applypatch
[ options ] patch-kit

DESCRIPTION

Applypatch
applies a patch kit as generated by the makepatch
program. It performs the following actions:

&bull;

First, it will extensively verify that the patch kit is
complete and did not get corrupted during transfer.

&bull;

Then it will apply some heuristics to verify that the
directory in which the patch will be applied does indeed
contain the expected sources.

If a corruption
or verification error is detected, applypatch exits
without making changes.

&bull;

If the kit is okay, and the
directory seems to be the right one: it creates new files
and directories as necessary.

&bull;

Then it runs the patch program to apply the patch
to the source files.

&bull;

Upon completion, obsolete files, directories and .orig
files are removed, file modes of new files are set, and the
timestamps of all patched files are adjusted.

Applypatch arguments

Applypatch
takes one argument, the name of the patch kit as generated
by makepatch. If no name is specified, the patch kit
is read from standard input.

Applypatch options

Options are
matched case insensitive, and may be abbreviated to
uniqueness. 
&minus;directory dir

The name of the source
directory to be patched.

&minus;check

Perform the checks on the patch
kit and patch directory, but do not make any changes.

&minus;force

Force continuation of the patch
process even when corruption or verification errors are
detected. This is very dangerous!

&minus;retain

Do not remove patch backup
files (with extension ".orig") upon
completion.

&minus;patch
cmd

The patch command to be used.
Default is ""patch &minus;p0
&minus;N"". Additionally, a
""&minus;s"" will be added
unless option &minus;verbose was specified.

&minus;verbose

This option will cause
applypatch and the patch program to emit
verbose progress information.

&minus;quiet

This option will cause
applypatch and the patch program to emit no
progress information, only error messages.

Environment variables

SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX

The suffix used by (some
versions of?) patch to back up the originals of
patched files. Upon completion, these files are removed by
applypatch unless the option &minus;retain was
specified. Default value if
"".orig"".
