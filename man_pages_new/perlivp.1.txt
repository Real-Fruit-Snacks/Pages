NAME

perlivp - Perl
Installation Verification Procedure

SYNOPSIS

perlivp
[-p] [-v] [-h]

DESCRIPTION

The
perlivp program is set up at Perl source code build
time to test the Perl version it was built under. It can be
used after running:

make
install

(or your
platform&rsquo;s equivalent procedure) to verify that
perl and its libraries have been installed correctly.
A correct installation is verified by output that looks
like:

ok 1 
ok 2

etc.

OPTIONS

-h
help

Prints out a brief help
message.

-p print preface

Gives a description of each
test prior to performing it.

-v verbose

Gives more detailed information
about each test, after it has been performed. Note that any
failed tests ought to print out some extra information
whether or not -v is thrown.

DIAGNOSTICS

&bull;

print "# Perl binary
&rsquo;$perlpath&rsquo; does not appear
executable.\n"; 

Likely to occur
for a perl binary that was not properly installed. Correct
by conducting a proper installation.

&bull;

print "# Perl version
&rsquo;$]&rsquo; installed, expected
$ivp_VERSION.\n"; 

Likely to occur
for a perl that was not properly installed. Correct by
conducting a proper installation.

&bull;

print "# Perl \@INC
directory &rsquo;$_&rsquo; does not appear to
exist.\n"; 

Likely to occur
for a perl library tree that was not properly installed.
Correct by conducting a proper installation.

&bull;

print "# Needed module
&rsquo;$_&rsquo; does not appear to be properly
installed.\n"; 

One of the two
modules that is used by perlivp was not present in the
installation. This is a serious error since it adversely
affects perlivp&rsquo;s ability to function. You may be able
to correct this by performing a proper perl
installation.

&bull;

print "# Required module
&rsquo;$_&rsquo; does not appear to be properly
installed.\n"; 

An attempt to
"eval "require $module"" failed, even
though the list of extensions indicated that it should
succeed. Correct by conducting a proper installation.

&bull;

print "# Unnecessary module
&rsquo;bLuRfle&rsquo; appears to be installed.\n";

This test not
coming out ok could indicate that you have in fact installed
a bLuRfle.pm module or that the "eval " require
\"$module_name.pm\"; "" test may give
misleading results with your installation of perl. If yours
is the latter case then please let the author know.

&bull;

print "#
file",+($#missing == 0) ? &rsquo;&rsquo; :
&rsquo;s&rsquo;," missing from
installation:\n"; 

One or more
files turned up missing according to a run of
"ExtUtils::Installed -> validate()" over your
installation. Correct by conducting a proper
installation.

For further
information on how to conduct a proper installation consult
the INSTALL file that comes with the perl source and the
README file for your platform.
