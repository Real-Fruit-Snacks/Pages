NAME

ppmrainbow -
Generate a rainbow

SYNOPSIS

ppmrainbow

[-width=number]
[-height=number]
[-tmpdir=directory] [-norepeat]
[-verbose] color ...

DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

ppmrainbow
generates a PPM image that fades from one color to another
to another from left to right, like a rainbow.

If you want a
vertical or other non-horizontal rainbow, run the output
through pnmrotate or pamflip.

One use for
such a rainbow is to compose it with another image under a
transparency mask in order to add a rainbow area to another
image. In fact, you can make rainbow-colored text by using
pbmtext, pamcomp, and ppmrainbow.

pgmramp
does a similar thing for grayscale images.

If you just
want an image containing all the possible colors (for some
kind of processing; not to look at), see pamseq.

ARGUMENTS

color
... is the list of colors, in order from left to right, to
go into the rainbow.

The first color
is added again on the right end of the image unless you
specify the -norepeat option. This means you can
concatenate multiple copies (tile, as with pnmtile)
to make a continuous larger image.

color is
as described for the
argument of the
pnm_parsecolor() library routine .

OPTIONS

All options can
be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix. You may use
two hyphens instead of one to designate an option. You may
use either white space or equals signs between an option
name and its value. 
-width number

The width in pixels of the
output image.

Default is
600.

-height
number

The height in pixels of the
output image.

Default is
8.

-norepeat

This option
makes ppmrainbow end the rainbow with the last color
you specify. Without this option, ppmrainbow adds the
first color you specify to the right end of the rainbow as
if you had repeated it.

-tmpdir

The directory specification of
the directory ppmrainbow is to use for temporary
files.

Default is the
value of the TMPDIR environment variable, or
/tmp if TMPDIR is not set.

ppmrainbow
always creates a directory within this directory and creates
all its files within that directory.

-verbose

Print the "commands"
(invocations of other Netpbm programs) that
ppmrainbow uses to create the image.
