NAME

lesskey -
customize key bindings for less

SYNOPSIS (deprecated)

lesskey [-o
output] [--] [input] 
lesskey [--output=output] [--] [input] 
lesskey -V 
lesskey --version

SCOPE

This document
describes the format of the lesskey source file,
which is used by less version 582 and later. In
previous versions of less, a separate program called
lesskey was used to compile the lesskey source
file into a format understood by less. This
compilation step is no longer required and the
lesskey program is therefore deprecated, although the
file format remains supported by less itself.

DESCRIPTION

A
lesskey file specifies a set of key bindings and
environment variables to be used by subsequent invocations
of less.

FILE FORMAT

The input file
consists of one or more sections. Each section starts
with a line that identifies the type of section. Possible
sections are: 
#command

Customizes command key
bindings.

#line-edit

Customizes line-editing key
bindings.

#env

Defines environment variables.

Blank lines and
lines which start with a hash mark (#) are ignored, except
as noted below.

COMMAND SECTION

The command
section begins with the line

#command

If the command
section is the first section in the file, this line may be
omitted. The command section consists of lines of the
form:

string
 action [extra-string]

Whitespace is
any sequence of one or more spaces and/or tabs. The
string is the command key(s) which invoke the action.
The string may be a single command key, or a sequence
of up to 15 keys. The action is the name of the less
action, from the list below. The characters in the
string may appear literally, or be prefixed by a
caret to indicate a control key. A backslash followed by one
to three octal digits may be used to specify a character by
its octal value. A backslash followed by certain characters
specifies input characters as follows:

\k followed by
a single character represents the char(s) produced when one
of these keys is pressed:

A backslash
followed by any other character indicates that character is
to be taken literally. Characters which must be preceded by
backslash include caret, space, tab, hash mark and the
backslash itself.

An action may
be followed by an "extra" string. When such a
command is entered while running less, the action is
performed, and then the extra string is parsed, just as if
it were typed in to less. This feature can be used in
certain cases to extend the functionality of a command. For
example, see the "{" and ":t" commands
in the example below. The extra string has a special meaning
for the "quit" action: when less quits, the
first character of the extra string is used as its exit
status.

EXAMPLE

The following
input file describes the set of default command keys used by
less. Documentation on each command can be found in
the man page, under the key sequence which invokes the
command.

PRECEDENCE

Commands
specified by lesskey take precedence over the default
commands. A default command key may be disabled by including
it in the input file with the action "invalid".
Alternatively, a key may be defined to do nothing by using
the action "noaction". "noaction" is
similar to "invalid", but less will give an
error beep for an "invalid" command, but not for a
"noaction" command. In addition, ALL default
commands may be disabled by adding this control line to the
input file:

#stop

This will cause
all default commands to be ignored. The #stop line should be
the last line in that section of the file.

Be aware that
#stop can be dangerous. Since all default commands are
disabled, you must provide sufficient commands before the
#stop line to enable all necessary actions. For example,
failure to provide a "quit" command can lead to
frustration.

LINE EDITING SECTION

The
line-editing section begins with the line:

#line-edit

This section
specifies new key bindings for the line editing commands, in
a manner similar to the way key bindings for ordinary
commands are specified in the #command section. The
line-editing section consists of a list of keys and actions,
one per line as in the example below.

EXAMPLE

The following
input file describes the set of default line-editing keys
used by less:

LESS ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

The environment
variable section begins with the line

#env

Following this
line is a list of environment variable assignments. Each
line consists of an environment variable name, an equals
sign (=) and the value to be assigned to the environment
variable. White space before and after the equals sign is
ignored. Variables assigned in this way are visible only to
less. If a variable is specified in the system
environment and also in a lesskey file, the value in the
lesskey file takes precedence.

If the variable
name is followed by += rather than =, the string is appended
to the variable&rsquo;s existing value. This currently works
only if any += lines immediately follow the same
variable&rsquo;s original definition (with an = line),
without any intervening definitions of other variables. It
can append only to a variable defined earlier in the file;
it cannot append to a variable in the system environment.
The string is appended literally, without any extra
whitespace added, so if whitespace is desired, it should be
appended to the end of the preceding line. (It cannot be
added to the beginning of the += string because space after
the equals sign is ignored, as noted above.)

CONDITIONAL CONFIGURATION

If a line
begins with #version followed by a relational operator and a
version number, the remainder of the line is parsed if and
only if the running version of less (or
lesskey) matches the operator. This can be helpful if
a lesskey file is used by different versions of
less.

For example,
suppose that a new command named
&rsquo;sideways-search&rsquo; is added in less
version 777. Then the following line would assign the
command to the Q key, but only in versions of less
which support it. The line would be ignored by versions
earlier than 777.

#version >=
777 Q sideways-search

These six
operators are supported:

The #version
feature is not supported in less and lesskey
before version 594. In those older versions, all #version
lines are ignored.

EXAMPLE

The following
input file sets the -i and -S options when is run and, on
version 595 and higher, adds a --color option.

#env

## (Note that there must be a space at the end of the
next line,

## to separate the --color option from the -S
option.) 

LESS = -i -S 

#version >= 595  LESS += --color=Hkc

WARNINGS

On MS-DOS and
OS/2 systems, certain keys send a sequence of characters
which start with a NUL character (0). This NUL character
should be represented as \340 in a lesskey file.
