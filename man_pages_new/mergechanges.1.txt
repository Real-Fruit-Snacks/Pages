NAME

mergechanges -
merge multiple changes files

SYNOPSIS

mergechanges
[-d] [-f] [-S] [-i] file1
file2 [file...]

DESCRIPTION

mergechanges
merges two or more .changes files, merging the
Architecture, Description and Files (and Checksums-*, if
present) fields of the two. There are checks made to ensure
that the changes files are from the same source package and
version and use the same changes file Format. The first
changes file is used as the basis and the information from
the later ones is merged into it.

The output is
normally written to stdout. If the -f option
is given, the output is written to
package_version_multi.changes instead, in the
same directory as the first changes file listed.

If the
-d option is given and the output is generated
successfully, the input files will be deleted.

If the
-i or --indep option is given, source packages
and architecture-independent (Architecture: all) packages
are included in the output, but architecture-dependent
packages are not.

If the
-S or --source option is given, only source
packages are included in the output.
