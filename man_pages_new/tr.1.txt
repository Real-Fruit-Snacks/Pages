NAME

tr - translate
characters

SYNOPSIS

tr [
-cds ] [ string1 [ string2 ] ]

DESCRIPTION

Tr
copies the standard input to the standard output with
substitution or deletion of selected characters (runes).
Input characters found in string1 are mapped into the
corresponding characters of string2. When
string2 is short it is padded to the length of
string1 by duplicating its last character. Any
combination of the options -cds may be used:

-c

Complement string1: replace it with a
lexicographically ordered list of all other characters.

-d

Delete from input all characters in string1.

-s

Squeeze repeated output characters that occur in
string2 to single characters.

In either
string a noninitial sequence -x, where
x is any character (possibly quoted), stands for a
range of characters: a possibly empty sequence of codes
running from the successor of the previous code up through
the code for x. The character followed by 1, 2 or 3
octal digits stands for the character whose 16-bit value is
given by those digits. The character sequence followed by 1,
2, 3, or 4 hexadecimal digits stands for the character whose
16-bit value is given by those digits. A followed by any
other character stands for that character.

EXAMPLES

Replace all
upper-case ASCII letters by lower-case.

tr A-Z a-z
lower

Create a list
of all the words in one per line in where a word is taken to
be a maximal string of alphabetics. String2 is given
as a quoted newline.

tr -cs A-Za-z
