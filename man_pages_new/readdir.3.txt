NAME

readdir -
directory input parser for gawk

SYNOPSIS

@load
"readdir"

DESCRIPTION

The
readdir extension adds an input parser for
directories.

When this
extension is in use, instead of skipping directories named
on the command line (or with getline), they are read,
with each entry returned as a record.

The record
consists of three fields. The first two are the inode number
and the filename, separated by a forward slash character. On
systems where the directory entry contains the file type,
the record has a third field which is a single letter
indicating the type of the file: f for file, d
for directory, b for a block device, c for a
character device, p for a FIFO, l for a
symbolic link, s for a socket.

On systems
without the file type information, the extension falls back
to calling stat(2), in order to provide the
information. Thus the third field should never be
u.

By default, if
a directory cannot be opened (due to permission problems,
for example), gawk will exit. As with regular files,
this situation can be handled using a BEGINFILE rule
that checks ERRNO and prints an error or otherwise
handles the problem.

EXAMPLE

@load
"readdir" 
... 
BEGIN { FS = "/" } 
{ print "file name is", $2 }
