DESCRIPTION

These files
contain configuration options for systemd-udevd(8).
The syntax of these files is very simple: a list of
assignments, one per line. All empty lines or lines
beginning with "#" are ignored.

The following
options can be set:

udev_log=

The log level. Valid values are
the numerical syslog priorities or their textual
representations: err, info and
debug.

Note

This option is also honored by udevadm(8).

Added in version 216.

children_max=

An integer. The maximum
number of events executed in parallel. When unspecified or 0
is specified, the maximum is determined based on the system
resources.

This is
the same as the --children-max= option.

Added in
version 240.

exec_delay=

An integer. Delay the
execution of each RUN{program} parameter by the given
number of seconds. This option might be useful when
debugging system crashes during coldplug caused by loading
non-working kernel modules.

This is
the same as the --exec-delay= option.

Added in
version 240.

event_timeout=

An integer. The number of
seconds to wait for events to finish. After this time, the
event will be terminated. The default is 180
seconds.

This is
the same as the --event-timeout= option.

Added in
version 240.

resolve_names=

Specifies when
systemd-udevd should resolve names of users and groups. When
set to early (the default), names will be resolved
when the rules are parsed. When set to late, names
will be resolved for every event. When set to never,
names will never be resolved and all devices will be owned
by root.

This is
the same as the --resolve-names= option.

Added in
version 240.

timeout_signal=

Specifies a signal that
systemd-udevd will send on worker timeouts. Note that both
workers and spawned processes will be killed using this
signal. Defaults to SIGKILL.

Added in
version 246.

In
addition, systemd-udevd can be configured by command line
options and the kernel command line (see
systemd-udevd(8)).
