NAME

ppmrelief -
compute a relief of a PPM image

SYNOPSIS

ppmrelief

[ppmfile]

DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

ppmrelief
reads a PPM image as input, and writes a relief of that
image as a PPM image as output.

The relief
process is described in "Beyond Photography" by
Holzmann, equation 3.19. It&rsquo;s a sort of edge-detection
and is essentially a convolution with this matrix:

| 1 0 0 | 
| 0 0 0 | 
| 0 0 -1 |

OPTIONS

There are no
command line options defined specifically for
ppmrelief, but it recognizes the options common to
all programs based on libnetpbm (See
 Common Options
.)
