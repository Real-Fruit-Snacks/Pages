NAME

run-with-aspell
- script to help use GNU Aspell as an ispell replacement

SYNOPSIS

run-with-aspell

DESCRIPTION

The recommended
way to use Aspell as a replacement for Ispell
is to change the Ispell command from within the
program being used. If that is not possible, the
run-with-aspell script may be used instead.

OPTIONS

is the name of the program with
any optional arguments.

The old method
of mapping ispell to Aspell is discouraged because it can
create compatibility problems with programs that actually
require ispell such as ispell&rsquo;s own scripts.

SEE ALSO

aspell(1),
aspell-import(1), word-list-compress(1)

Aspell is fully
documented in its Texinfo manual. See the
&rsquo;aspell&rsquo; entry in info for more
complete documentation.
