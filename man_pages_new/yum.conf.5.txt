NAME

yum.conf
&minus; Configuration file for yum(8).

DESCRIPTION

Yum uses a
configuration file at /etc/yum/yum.conf.

Additional
configuration files are also read from the directories set
by the reposdir option (default is
&rsquo;/etc/yum/repos.d&rsquo;). See the reposdir
option below for further details.

PARAMETERS

There are two
types of sections in the yum configuration file(s): main and
repository. Main defines all global configuration options.
There should be only one main section. The repository
section(s) define the configuration for each
repository/server. There should be one or more repository
sections.

[main] OPTIONS

The [main]
section must exist for yum to do anything. It consists of
the following options:

cachedir
Directory where yum should store its cache and db files. The
default is &rsquo;/var/cache/yum&rsquo;.

persistdir
Directory where yum should store information that should
persist over multiple runs. The default is
&rsquo;/var/lib/yum&rsquo;.

keepcache
Either &rsquo;1&rsquo; or &rsquo;0&rsquo;. Determines
whether or not yum keeps the cache of headers and packages
after successful installation. Default is &rsquo;1&rsquo;
(keep files)

reposdir
A list of directories where yum should look for .repo files
which define repositories to use. Default is
&rsquo;/etc/yum/repos.d&rsquo;. Each file in this directory
should contain one or more repository sections as documented
in [repository] options below. These will be merged
with the repositories defined in /etc/yum/yum.conf to form
the complete set of repositories that yum will use.

debuglevel
Debug message output level. Practical range is 0&minus;10.
Default is &rsquo;2&rsquo;.

errorlevel
Error message output level. Practical range is 0&minus;10.
Default is &rsquo;2&rsquo;.

rpmverbosity
Debug scriptlet output level. &rsquo;info&rsquo; is the
default, other options are: &rsquo;critical&rsquo;,
&rsquo;emergency&rsquo;, &rsquo;error&rsquo;,
&rsquo;warn&rsquo; and &rsquo;debug&rsquo;.

protected_packages
This is a list of packages that yum should never completely
remove. They are protected via. Obsoletes as well as
user/plugin removals.

The default is:
yum glob:/etc/yum/protected.d/*.conf So any packages which
should be protected can do so by including a file in
/etc/yum/protected.d with their package name in it.

Also if this
configuration is set to anything, then yum will protect the
package corresponding to the running version of the
kernel.

protected_multilib
Either &rsquo;1&rsquo; or &rsquo;0&rsquo;. This tells yum
whether or not it should perform a check to make sure that
multilib packages are the same version. For example, if this
option is off (rpm behaviour) pkgA-1.x86_64 and pkgA-2.i386
can be installed at the same time. However this is very
rarely desired. Install only packages, like the kernel, are
exempt from this check. The default is &rsquo;1&rsquo;.

logfile
Full directory and file name for where yum should write its
log file.

gpgcheck
Either &rsquo;1&rsquo; or &rsquo;0&rsquo;. This tells yum
whether or not it should perform a GPG signature check on
packages. When this is set in the [main] section it sets the
default for all repositories. The default is
&rsquo;0&rsquo;.

localpkg_gpgcheck
Either &rsquo;1&rsquo; or &rsquo;0&rsquo;. This tells yum
whether or not it should perform a GPG signature check on
local packages (packages in a file, not in a repositoy). The
default is &rsquo;0&rsquo;.

repo_gpgcheck
Either &rsquo;1&rsquo; or &rsquo;0&rsquo;. This tells yum
whether or not it should perform a GPG signature check on
the repodata. When this is set in the [main] section it sets
the default for all repositories. The default is
&rsquo;0&rsquo;.

skip_broken
Either &rsquo;1&rsquo; or &rsquo;0&rsquo;. Resolve depsolve
problems by removing packages that are causing problems from
the transaction.

assumeyes
Either &rsquo;1&rsquo; or &rsquo;0&rsquo;. Determines
whether or not yum prompts for confirmation of critical
actions. Default is &rsquo;0&rsquo; (do prompt). 
Command-line option: &minus;y

alwaysprompt
Either &rsquo;1&rsquo; or &rsquo;0&rsquo;. Without this
option, yum will not prompt for confirmation when the list
of packages to be installed exactly matches those given on
the command line. Unless assumeyes is enabled, it
will still prompt for package removal, or when additional
packages need to be installed to fulfill dependencies.
Default is &rsquo;1&rsquo;.

tolerant
Either &rsquo;1&rsquo; or &rsquo;0&rsquo;. If enabled, then
yum will be tolerant of errors on the command line with
regard to packages. For example: if you request to install
foo, bar and baz and baz is installed; yum won&rsquo;t error
out complaining that baz is already installed. Default to
&rsquo;0&rsquo; (not tolerant). 
Command-line option: &minus;t

exclude
List of packages to exclude from updates or installs. This
should be a space separated list. Shell globs using
wildcards (eg. * and ?) are allowed.

exactarch
Either &rsquo;1&rsquo; or &rsquo;0&rsquo;. Set to
&rsquo;1&rsquo; to make yum update only update the
architectures of packages that you have installed. ie: with
this enabled yum will not install an i686 package to update
an i386 package. Default is &rsquo;1&rsquo;.

installonlypkgs
List of package provides that should only ever be installed,
never updated. Kernels in particular fall into this
category. Defaults to kernel, kernel-bigmem,
kernel-enterprise, kernel-smp, kernel-modules, kernel-debug,
kernel-unsupported, kernel-source, kernel-devel, kernel-PAE,
kernel-PAE-debug.

Note that
because these are provides, and not just package names,
kernel-devel will also apply to kernel-debug-devel, etc.

installonly_limit
Number of packages listed in installonlypkgs to keep
installed at the same time. Setting to 0 disables this
feature. Default is &rsquo;0&rsquo;. Note that this
functionality used to be in the "installonlyn"
plugin, where this option was altered via. tokeep. Note that
as of version 3.2.24, yum will now look in the yumdb for a
installonly attribute on installed packages. If that
attribute is "keep", then they will never be
removed.

kernelpkgnames
List of package names that are kernels. This is really only
here for the updating of kernel packages and should be
removed out in the yum 2.1 series.

showdupesfromrepos
Either &rsquo;0&rsquo; or &rsquo;1&rsquo;. Set to
&rsquo;1&rsquo; if you wish to show any duplicate packages
from any repository, from package listings like the info or
list commands. Set to &rsquo;0&rsquo; if you want only to
see the newest packages from any repository. Default is
&rsquo;0&rsquo;.

obsoletes
This option only has affect during an update. It
enables yum&rsquo;s obsoletes processing logic. Useful when
doing distribution level upgrades. See also the yum
upgrade command documentation for more details
(yum(8)). Default is &rsquo;true&rsquo;. 
Command-line option: &minus;&minus;obsoletes

overwrite_groups
Either &rsquo;0&rsquo; or &rsquo;1&rsquo;. Used to determine
yum&rsquo;s behaviour if two or more repositories offer the
package groups with the same name. If
overwrite_groups is &rsquo;1&rsquo; then the group
packages of the last matching repository will be used. If
overwrite_groups is &rsquo;0&rsquo; then the groups
from all matching repositories will be merged together as
one large group.

groupremove_leaf_only
Either &rsquo;0&rsquo; or &rsquo;1&rsquo;. Used to determine
yum&rsquo;s behaviour when the groupremove command is run.
If groupremove_leaf_only is &rsquo;0&rsquo; (default)
then all packages in the group will be removed. If
groupremove_leaf_only is &rsquo;1&rsquo; then only
those packages in the group that aren&rsquo;t required by
another package will be removed.

enable_group_conditionals
Either &rsquo;0&rsquo; or &rsquo;1&rsquo;. Determines
whether yum will allow the use of conditionals packages.
Default is &rsquo;1&rsquo; (package conditionals are
allowed).

group_package_types
List of the following: optional, default, mandatory. Tells
yum which type of packages in groups will be installed when
&rsquo;groupinstall&rsquo; is called. Default is: default,
mandatory

installroot
Specifies an alternative installroot, relative to which all
packages will be installed. 
Command-line option: &minus;&minus;installroot

distroverpkg
The package used by yum to determine the "version"
of the distribution. This can be any installed package.
Default is &rsquo;redhat-release&rsquo;. You can see what
provides this manually by using: "yum whatprovides
redhat-release".

diskspacecheck
Either &rsquo;0&rsquo; or &rsquo;1&rsquo;. Set this to
&rsquo;0&rsquo; to disable the checking for sufficient
diskspace before a RPM transaction is run. Default is
&rsquo;1&rsquo; (perform the check).

tsflags
Comma or space separated list of transaction flags to pass
to the rpm transaction set. These include
&rsquo;noscripts&rsquo;, &rsquo;notriggers&rsquo;,
&rsquo;nodocs&rsquo;, &rsquo;test&rsquo;,
&rsquo;justdb&rsquo; and &rsquo;nocontexts&rsquo;.
&rsquo;repackage&rsquo; is also available but that does
nothing with newer rpm versions. You can set all/any of
them. However, if you don&rsquo;t know what these do in the
context of an rpm transaction set you&rsquo;re best leaving
it alone. Default is an empty list.

recent
Number of days back to look for &rsquo;recent&rsquo;
packages added to a repository. Used by the list
recent command. Default is &rsquo;7&rsquo;.

retries
Set the number of times any attempt to retrieve a file
should retry before returning an error. Setting this to
&rsquo;0&rsquo; makes yum try forever. Default is
&rsquo;10&rsquo;.

keepalive
Either &rsquo;0&rsquo; or &rsquo;1&rsquo;. Set whether HTTP
keepalive should be used for HTTP/1.1 servers that support
it. This can improve transfer speeds by using one connection
when downloading multiple files from a repository. Default
is &rsquo;1&rsquo;.

timeout
Number of seconds to wait for a connection before timing
out. Defaults to 30 seconds. This may be too short of a time
for extremely overloaded sites.

http_caching
Determines how upstream HTTP caches are instructed to handle
any HTTP downloads that Yum does. This option can take the
following values:

&rsquo;all&rsquo;
means that all HTTP downloads should be cached.

&rsquo;packages&rsquo;
means that only RPM package downloads should be cached (but
not repository metadata downloads).

&rsquo;none&rsquo;
means that no HTTP downloads should be cached.

The default is
&rsquo;all&rsquo;. This is recommended unless you are
experiencing caching related issues. Try to at least use
&rsquo;packages&rsquo; to minimize load on repository
servers.

throttle
Enable bandwidth throttling for downloads. This option can
be expressed as a absolute data rate in bytes/sec. An SI
prefix (k, M or G) may be appended to the bandwidth value
(eg. &rsquo;5.5k&rsquo; is 5.5 kilobytes/sec,
&rsquo;2M&rsquo; is 2 Megabytes/sec).

Alternatively,
this option can specify the percentage of total bandwidth to
use (eg. &rsquo;60%&rsquo;). In this case the
bandwidth option should be used to specify the
maximum available bandwidth.

Set to
&rsquo;0&rsquo; to disable bandwidth throttling. This is the
default.

bandwidth
Use to specify the maximum available network bandwidth in
bytes/second. Used with the throttle option (above).
If throttle is a percentage and bandwidth is
&rsquo;0&rsquo; then bandwidth throttling will be disabled.
If throttle is expressed as a data rate (bytes/sec)
then this option is ignored. Default is &rsquo;0&rsquo; (no
bandwidth throttling).

sslcacert
Path to the directory containing the databases of the
certificate authorities yum should use to verify SSL
certificates. Defaults to none - uses system default

sslverify
Boolean - should yum verify SSL certificates/hosts at all.
Defaults to True.

Note that the
plugin yum-rhn-plugin will force this value to true, and may
alter other ssl settings (like hostname checking), even if
it the machine is not registered.

sslclientcert
Path to the SSL client certificate yum should use to connect
to repos/remote sites Defaults to none.

Note that if
you are using curl compiled against NSS (default in
Fedora/RHEL), curl treats sslclientcert values with the same
basename as _identical_. This version of yum will check that
this isn&rsquo;t true and output an error when the
repositories "foo" and "bar" violate
this, like so:

sslclientcert
basename shared between foo and bar

sslclientkey
Path to the SSL client key yum should use to connect to
repos/remote sites Defaults to none.

history_record
Boolean - should yum record history entries for
transactions. This takes some disk space, and some extra
time in the transactions. But it allows how to know a lot of
information about what has happened before, and display it
to the user with the history info/list/summary commands. yum
also provides the history undo/redo commands. Defaults to
True.

Note that if
history is recorded, yum uses that information to see if any
modifications to the rpmdb have been done outside of yum.
These are always bad, from yum&rsquo;s point of view, and so
yum will issue a warning and automatically run some of
"yum check" to try and find some of the worst
problems altering the rpmdb might have caused.

This means that
turning this option off will stop yum from being able to
detect when the rpmdb has changed and thus. it will never
warn you or automatically run "yum check". The
problems will likely still be there, and yumdb etc. will
still be wrong but yum will not warn you about it.

history_record_packages
This is a list of package names that should be recorded as
having helped the transaction. yum plugins have an API to
add themselves to this, so it should not normally be
necessary to add packages here. Not that this is also used
for the packages to look for in &minus;&minus;version.
Defaults to rpm, yum, yum-metadata-parser.

history_list_view
Which column of information to display in the "yum
history list" command. There are currently three
options: users, cmds (or commands), auto.

Older versions
of yum acted like "users", which always outputs
the user who initiated the yum transaction. You can now
specify "commands" which will instead always
output the command line of the transaction. You can also
specify "single-user-commands" which will display
the users if there are more than one, otherwise it will
display the command line.

You can also
specify "default" which currently selects
"single-user-commands".

commands
List of functional commands to run if no functional commands
are specified on the command line (eg. "update foo bar
baz quux"). None of the short options (eg. &minus;y,
&minus;e, &minus;d) are accepted for this option.

syslog_ident
Identification (program name) for syslog messages.

syslog_facility
Facility name for syslog messages, see syslog(3). Default is
&rsquo;LOG_USER&rsquo;.

syslog_device
Where to log syslog messages. Can be a local device (path)
or a host:port string to use a remote syslog. If empty or
points to a nonexistent device, syslog logging is disabled.
Default is &rsquo;/dev/log&rsquo;.

proxy
URL to the proxy server that yum should use.

proxy_username
username to use for proxy

proxy_password
password for this proxy

username
username to use for basic authentication to a repo or really
any url.

password
password to use with the username for basic
authentication.

plugins
Either &rsquo;0&rsquo; or &rsquo;1&rsquo;. Global switch to
enable or disable yum plugins. Default is &rsquo;0&rsquo;
(plugins disabled). See the PLUGINS section of the
yum(8) man for more information on installing yum
plugins.

pluginpath
A list of directories where yum should look for plugin
modules. Default is &rsquo;/usr/share/yum-plugins&rsquo; and
&rsquo;/usr/lib/yum-plugins&rsquo;.

pluginconfpath
A list of directories where yum should look for plugin
configuration files. Default is
&rsquo;/etc/yum/pluginconf.d&rsquo;.

metadata_expire
Time (in seconds) after which the metadata will expire. So
that if the current metadata downloaded is less than this
many seconds old then yum will not update the metadata
against the repository. If you find that yum is not
downloading information on updates as often as you would
like lower the value of this option. You can also change
from the default of using seconds to using days, hours or
minutes by appending a d, h or m respectively. The default
is 6 hours, to compliment yum-updatesd running once an hour.
It&rsquo;s also possible to use the word "never",
meaning that the metadata will never expire. Note that when
using a metalink file the metalink must always be newer than
the metadata for the repository, due to the validation, so
this timeout also applies to the metalink file.

mirrorlist_expire
Time (in seconds) after which the mirrorlist locally cached
will expire. If the current mirrorlist is less than this
many seconds old then yum will not download another copy of
the mirrorlist, it has the same extra format as
metadata_expire. If you find that yum is not downloading the
mirrorlists as often as you would like lower the value of
this option.

mdpolicy
You can select from different metadata download policies
depending on how much data you want to download with the
main repository metadata index. The advantages of
downloading more metadata with the index is that you
can&rsquo;t get into situations where you need to use that
metadata later and the versions available aren&rsquo;t
compatible (or the user lacks privileges) and that if the
metadata is corrupt in any way yum will revert to the
previous metadata.

&rsquo;instant&rsquo;
- Just download the new metadata index, this is roughly what
yum always did, however it now does some checking on the
index and reverts if it classifies it as bad.

&rsquo;group:primary&rsquo;
- Download the primary metadata with the index. This
contains most of the package information and so is almost
always required anyway. This is the default.

&rsquo;group:small&rsquo;
- With the primary also download the updateinfo metadata,
this is required for yum-security operations and it also
used in the graphical clients. This file also tends to be
significantly smaller than most others.

&rsquo;group:main&rsquo;
- With the primary and updateinfo download the filelists
metadata and the group metadata. The filelists data is
required for operations like "yum install
/bin/bash", and also some dependency resolutions
require it. The group data is used in some graphical clients
and for group operations like "yum grouplist
Base".

&rsquo;group:all&rsquo;
- Download all metadata listed in the index, currently the
only one not listed above is the other metadata, which
contains the changelog information which is used by
yum-changelog. This is what "yum makecache"
uses.

multilib_policy
Can be set to &rsquo;all&rsquo; or &rsquo;best&rsquo;. All
means install all possible arches for any package you want
to install. Therefore yum install foo will install foo.i386
and foo.x86_64 on x86_64, if it is available. Best means
install the best arch for this platform, only.

bugtracker_url
URL where bugs should be filed for yum. Configurable for
local versions or distro-specific bugtrackers.

color
Whether to display colorized output automatically, depending
on the output terminal, can be changed to always (using ANSI
codes) or never. Default is &rsquo;auto&rsquo;. Possible
values are: auto, never, always. Command-line option:
&minus;&minus;color

color_list_installed_older
The colorization/highlighting for packages in list/info
installed which are older than the latest available package
with the same name and arch. Default is &rsquo;bold&rsquo;.
Possible values are a comma separated list containing: bold,
blink, dim, reverse, underline, fg:black, fg:red, fg:green,
fg:yellow, fg:blue, fg:magenta, fg:cyan, fg:white, bg:black,
bg:red, bg:green, bg:yellow, bg:blue, bg:magenta, bg:cyan,
bg:white.

color_list_installed_newer
The colorization/highlighting for packages in list/info
installed which are newer than the latest available package
with the same name and arch. Default is
&rsquo;bold,yellow&rsquo;. See color_list_installed_older
for possible values.

color_list_installed_reinstall
The colorization/highlighting for packages in list/info
installed which is the same version as the latest available
package with the same name and arch. Default is
&rsquo;normal&rsquo;. See color_list_installed_older for
possible values.

color_list_installed_extra
The colorization/highlighting for packages in list/info
installed which has no available package with the same name
and arch. Default is &rsquo;bold,red&rsquo;. See
color_list_installed_older for possible values.

color_list_available_upgrade
The colorization/highlighting for packages in list/info
available which is an upgrade for the latest installed
package with the same name and arch. Default is
&rsquo;bold,blue&rsquo;. See color_list_installed_older for
possible values.

color_list_available_downgrade
The colorization/highlighting for packages in list/info
available which is a downgrade for the latest installed
package with the same name and arch. Default is
&rsquo;dim,cyan&rsquo;. See color_list_installed_older for
possible values.

color_list_available_install
The colorization/highlighting for packages in list/info
available which has no installed package with the same name
and arch. Default is &rsquo;normal&rsquo;. See
color_list_installed_older for possible values.

color_list_available_reinstall
The colorization/highlighting for packages in list/info
available which is the same version as the installed package
with the same name and arch. Default is
&rsquo;bold,underline,green. See color_list_installed_older
for possible values.

color_search_match
The colorization/highlighting for text matches in search.
Default is &rsquo;bold&rsquo;. See
color_list_installed_older for possible values.

color_update_installed
The colorization/highlighting for packages in the
"updates list" which are installed. The updates
list is what is printed when you run "yum update",
"yum list updates", "yum list obsoletes"
and "yum check-update". Default is
&rsquo;normal&rsquo;. See color_list_installed_older for
possible values.

color_update_local
The colorization/highlighting for packages in the
"updates list" which are already downloaded. The
updates list is what is printed when you run "yum
update", "yum list updates", "yum list
obsoletes" and "yum check-update". Default is
&rsquo;bold&rsquo;. See color_list_installed_older for
possible values.

color_update_remote
The colorization/highlighting for packages in the
"updates list" which need to be downloaded. The
updates list is what is printed when you run "yum
update", "yum list updates", "yum list
obsoletes" and "yum check-update". Default is
&rsquo;normal&rsquo;. See color_list_installed_older for
possible values.

clean_requirements_on_remove
When removing packages (by removal, update or obsoletion) go
through each package&rsquo;s dependencies. If any of them
are no longer required by any other package then also mark
them to be removed. Boolean (1, 0, True, False, yes,no)
Defaults to False

[repository] OPTIONS

The repository
section(s) take the following form:

Example:
[repositoryid] 
name=Some name for this repository 
baseurl=url://path/to/repository/

repositoryid
Must be a unique name for each repository, one word.

name A
human readable string describing the repository.

baseurl
Must be a URL to the directory where the yum
repository&rsquo;s &rsquo;repodata&rsquo; directory lives.
Can be an http://, ftp:// or file:// URL. You can specify
multiple URLs in one baseurl statement. The best way to do
this is like this: 
[repositoryid] 
name=Some name for this repository 
baseurl=url://server1/path/to/repository/ 
url://server2/path/to/repository/ 
url://server3/path/to/repository/

If you list
more than one baseurl= statement in a repository you will
find yum will ignore the earlier ones and probably act
bizarrely. Don&rsquo;t do this, you&rsquo;ve been
warned.

You can use
HTTP basic auth by prepending "user:password@" to
the server name in the baseurl line. For example:
"baseurl=http://user:passwd [AT] example.com/".

metalink
Specifies a URL to a metalink file for the repomd.xml, a
list of mirrors for the entire repository are generated by
converting the mirrors for the repomd.xml file to a baseurl.
The metalink file also contains the latest timestamp from
the data in the repomd.xml, the length of the repomd.xml and
checksum data. This data is checked against any downloaded
repomd.xml file and all of the information from the metalink
file must match. This can be used instead of or with the
baseurl option. Substitution variables, described
below, can be used with this option. This option disables
the mirrorlist option. As a special hack is the mirrorlist
URL contains the word "metalink" then the value of
mirrorlist is copied to metalink (if metalink is not
set).

mirrorlist
Specifies a URL to a file containing a list of baseurls.
This can be used instead of or with the baseurl
option. Substitution variables, described below, can be used
with this option. As a special hack is the mirrorlist URL
contains the word "metalink" then the value of
mirrorlist is copied to metalink (if metalink is not
set).

enabled
Either &rsquo;1&rsquo; or &rsquo;0&rsquo;. This tells yum
whether or not use this repository.

gpgcheck
Either &rsquo;1&rsquo; or &rsquo;0&rsquo;. This tells yum
whether or not it should perform a GPG signature check on
the packages gotten from this repository.

repo_gpgcheck
Either &rsquo;1&rsquo; or &rsquo;0&rsquo;. This tells yum
whether or not it should perform a GPG signature check on
the repodata from this repository.

gpgkey A
URL pointing to the ASCII-armored GPG key file for the
repository. This option is used if yum needs a public key to
verify a package and the required key hasn&rsquo;t been
imported into the RPM database. If this option is set, yum
will automatically import the key from the specified URL.
You will be prompted before the key is installed unless the
assumeyes option is set.

Multiple URLs
may be specified here in the same manner as the
baseurl option (above). If a GPG key is required to
install a package from a repository, all keys specified for
that repository will be installed.

gpgcakey
A URL pointing to the ASCII-armored CA key file for the
repository. This is a normal gpg public key - but this key
will be used to validate detached signatures of all other
keys. The idea is you are asked to confirm import for this
key. After that any other gpg key needed for package or
repository verification, if it has a detached signature
which matches this key will be automatically imported
without user confirmation.

exclude
Same as the [main] exclude option but only for this
repository. Substitution variables, described below, are
honored here.

includepkgs
Inverse of exclude. This is a list of packages you want to
use from a repository. If this option lists only one package
then that is all yum will ever see from the repository.
Defaults to an empty list. Substitution variables, described
below, are honored here.

enablegroups
Either &rsquo;0&rsquo; or &rsquo;1&rsquo;. Determines
whether yum will allow the use of package groups for this
repository. Default is &rsquo;1&rsquo; (package groups are
allowed).

failovermethod
Either &rsquo;roundrobin&rsquo; or
&rsquo;priority&rsquo;.

&rsquo;roundrobin&rsquo;
randomly selects a URL out of the list of URLs to start with
and proceeds through each of them as it encounters a failure
contacting the host.

&rsquo;priority&rsquo;
starts from the first baseurl listed and reads through them
sequentially.

failovermethod
defaults to &rsquo;roundrobin&rsquo; if not specified.

keepalive
Either &rsquo;1&rsquo; or &rsquo;0&rsquo;. This tells yum
whether or not HTTP/1.1 keepalive should be used with this
repository. See the global option in the [main] section
above for more information.

timeout
Overrides the timeout option from the [main] section
for this repository.

http_caching
Overrides the http_caching option from the [main]
section for this repository.

retries
Overrides the retries option from the [main] section
for this repository.

throttle
Overrides the throttle option from the [main] section
for this repository.

bandwidth
Overrides the bandwidth option from the [main]
section for this repository.

sslcacert
Overrides the sslcacert option from the [main]
section for this repository.

sslverify
Overrides the sslverify option from the [main]
section for this repository.

sslclientcert
Overrides the sslclientcert option from the [main]
section for this repository.

sslclientkey
Overrides the sslclientkey option from the [main]
section for this repository.

metadata_expire
Overrides the metadata_expire option from the [main]
section for this repository.

mirrorlist_expire
Overrides the mirrorlist_expire option from the
[main] section for this repository.

proxy
URL to the proxy server for this repository. Set to
&rsquo;_none_&rsquo; to disable the global proxy setting for
this repository. If this is unset it inherits it from the
global setting

proxy_username
username to use for proxy. If this is unset it inherits it
from the global setting

proxy_password
password for this proxy. If this is unset it inherits it
from the global setting

username
username to use for basic authentication to a repo or really
any url. If this is unset it inherits it from the global
setting

password
password to use with the username for basic authentication.
If this is unset it inherits it from the global setting

cost
relative cost of accessing this repository. Useful for
weighing one repo&rsquo;s packages as greater/less than any
other. defaults to 1000

skip_if_unavailable
If set to True yum will continue running if this repository
cannot be contacted for any reason. This should be set
carefully as all repos are consulted for any given command.
Defaults to False.

URL INCLUDE SYNTAX

The inclusion
of external configuration files is supported for
/etc/yum/yum.conf and the .repo files in the
/etc/yum/repos.d directory. To include a URL, use a line of
the following format:

include=url://to/some/location

The
configuration file will be inserted at the position of the
"include=" line. Included files may contain
further include lines. Yum will abort with an error if an
inclusion loop is detected.

GLOB: FOR LIST OPTIONS

Any of the
configurations options which are a list of items can be
specfied using the glob syntax:
glob:/etc/path/somewhere.d/*.conf. This will read in
all files matching that glob and include all lines in each
file (excluding comments and blank lines) as items in the
list.

VARIABLES

There are a
number of variables you can use to ease maintenance of
yum&rsquo;s configuration files. They are available in the
values of several options including name,
baseurl and commands.

$releasever
This will be replaced with the value of the version of the
package listed in distroverpkg. This defaults to the
version of &rsquo;redhat-release&rsquo; package.

$arch
This will be replaced with your architecture as listed by
os.uname()[4] in Python.

$basearch
This will be replaced with your base architecture in yum.
For example, if your $arch is i686 your $basearch will be
i386.

$uuid
This will be replaced with a unique but persistent uuid for
this machine. The value that is first generated will be
stored in /var/lib/yum/uuid and reused until this file is
deleted.

$YUM0-$YUM9
These will be replaced with the value of the shell
environment variable of the same name. If the shell
environment variable does not exist then the configuration
file variable will not be replaced.

As of 3.2.28,
any file in /etc/yum/vars is turned into a variable named
after the filename (or overrides any of the above
variables).

Note that no
warnings/errors are given if the files are unreadable, so
creating files that only root can read may be confusing for
users.

Also note that
only the first line will be read and all new line characters
are removed, as a convenience. However, no other checking is
performed on the data. This means it is possible to have bad
character data in any value.
