directory] pathname ...

DESCRIPTION

This manual
page describes the restorecon program.

This program is
primarily used to set the security context (extended
attributes) on one or more files.

It can also be
run at any other time to correct inconsistent labels, to add
support for newly-installed policy or, by using the
-n option, to passively check whether the file
contexts are all set as specified by the active policy
(default behavior).

If a file
object does not have a context, restorecon will write
the default context to the file object&rsquo;s extended
attributes. If a file object has a context,
restorecon will only modify the type portion of the
security context. The -F option will force a
replacement of the entire context.

If a file is
labeled with customizable SELinux type (for list of
customizable types see
/etc/selinux/{SELINUXTYPE}/contexts/customizable_types),
restorecon won&rsquo;t reset the label unless the -F option
is used.

It is the same
executable as setfiles but operates in a slightly
different manner depending on its argv[0].

OPTIONS

-e directory

exclude a directory (repeat the
option to exclude more than one directory, Requires full
path).

-f infilename

infilename contains a
list of files to be processed. Use &ldquo;-&rdquo;
for stdin.

-F

Force reset of context to match file_context for
customizable files, and the default file context, changing
the user, role, range portion as well as the type.

-h, -?

display usage information and exit.

-i

ignore files that do not exist.

-I

ignore digest to force checking of labels even if the
stored SHA1 digest matches the specfiles SHA1 digest. The
digest will then be updated provided there are no errors.
See the NOTES section for further details.

-D

Set or update any directory SHA1 digests. Use this
option to enable usage of the security.sehash
extended attribute.

-m

do not read /proc/mounts to obtain a list of
non-seclabel mounts to be excluded from relabeling checks.
Setting this option is useful where there is a non-seclabel
fs mounted with a seclabel fs mounted on a directory below
this. 

-n

don&rsquo;t change any file labels (passive check). To
display the files whose labels would be changed, add
-v. 

-o outfilename

Deprecated - This option is no
longer supported.

-p

show progress by printing the number of files in 1k
blocks unless relabeling the entire OS, that will then show
the approximate percentage complete. Note that the -p
and -v options are mutually exclusive.

-R, -r

change files and directories file labels recursively
(descend directories).

-v

show changes in file labels. Multiple -v options
increase the verbosity. Note that the -v and
-p options are mutually exclusive.

-W

display warnings about entries that had no matching
files by outputting the selabel_stats(3) results.

-0

the separator for the input items is assumed to be the
null character (instead of the white space). The quotes and
the backslash characters are also treated as normal
characters that can form valid input. This option finally
also disables the end of file string, which is treated like
any other argument. Useful when input items might contain
white space, quote marks or backslashes. The -print0
option of GNU find produces input suitable for this
mode. 

-x

prevent restorecon from crossing file system
boundaries. 

-T nthreads

use up to nthreads
threads. Specify 0 to create as many threads as there are
available CPU cores; 1 to use only a single thread
(default); or any positive number to use the given number of
threads (if possible).

ARGUMENTS

pathname ...
The pathname for the file(s) to be relabeled.

NOTES

1.

restorecon by default
does not operate recursively on directories. Paths leading
up the final component of the file(s) are canonicalized
using realpath(3) before labeling.

2.

If the pathname specifies the root directory and
the -vR or -vr options are set and the audit
system is running, then an audit event is automatically
logged stating that a "mass relabel" took place
using the message label FS_RELABEL.

3.

To improve performance when relabeling file systems
recursively (i.e. the -R or -r option is set),
the -D option to restorecon will cause it to
store a SHA1 digest of the default specfiles set in an
extended attribute named security.sehash on each
directory specified in pathname ... once the
relabeling has been completed successfully. These digests
will be checked should restorecon -D be rerun with
the same pathname parameters. See
selinux_restorecon(3) for further details.

The -I
option will ignore the SHA1 digest from each directory
specified in pathname ... and provided the
-n option is NOT set and recursive mode is set, files
will be relabeled as required with the digests then being
updated provided there are no errors.
