NAME

saned - SANE
network daemon

SYNOPSIS

saned [
-a [ username ] ] [ -u username
] [ -b address ] [ -p port ]
[ -l ] [ -D ] [ -o ] [ -d n ] [ -e ] [ -h ] [
-B buffer-size ]

DESCRIPTION

saned is
the SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) daemon that allows remote
clients to access image acquisition devices available on the
local host.

OPTIONS

saned
recognises the following options: 
-a [username],
--alone[=username]

is equivalent to the
combination of -l -D -u username options.
However, username is optional and running user will
only be set when specified.

-u username,
--user=username

requests that saned drop
root privileges and run as the user (and group) associated
with username after binding.

-b address,
--bind=address

tells saned to bind to
the address given.

-p port,
--port=port

tells saned to listen on
the port given. A value of 0 tells saned to
pick an unused port. The default is the sane-port
(6566).

-l, --listen

requests that saned run
in standalone daemon mode. In this mode, saned will
listen for incoming client connections; inetd(8) is
not required for saned operations in this mode.

-D,
--daemonize

will request saned to
detach from the console and run in the background.

-o, --once

requests that saned
exits after the first client disconnects. This is useful for
debugging.

-d n,
--debug=n

sets the level of saned
debug output to n. When compiled with debugging
enabled, this flag may be followed by a number to request
more or less debug info. The larger the number, the more
verbose the debug output. E.g., -d128 will request
output of all debug info. A level of 0 produces no output at
all. The default value is 2.

-e, --stderr

will divert saned debug
output to stderr instead of the syslog default.

-B,
--buffer-size=buffer-size

specifies the size of the read
buffer used for communication with the backend in KB.
Default value is 1MB.

-h, --help

displays a short help
message.

CONFIGURATION

The
saned.conf configuration file contains both options
for the daemon and the access list. 
data_portrange = min_port - max_port

Specify the port range to use
for the data connection. Pick a port range between 1024 and
65535; don&rsquo;t pick a too large port range, as it may
have performance issues. Use this option if your
saned server is sitting behind a firewall. If that
firewall is a Linux machine, we strongly recommend using the
Netfilter nf_conntrack_sane module instead.

data_connect_timeout =
timeout

Specify the time in
milliseconds that saned will wait for a data
connection. Without this option, if the data connection is
not done before the scanner reaches the end of scan, the
scanner will continue to scan past the end and may damage it
depending on the backend. Specify zero to have the old
behavior. The default is 4000ms.

The access list
is a list of host names, IP addresses or IP subnets (CIDR
notation) that are permitted to use local SANE devices. IPv6
addresses must be enclosed in brackets, and should always be
specified in their compressed form. Connections from
localhost are always permitted. Empty lines and lines
starting with a hash mark (#) are ignored. A line containing
the single character &rsquo;&rsquo;+&rsquo;&rsquo; is
interpreted to match any hostname. This allows any remote
machine to use your scanner and may present a security risk,
so this shouldn&rsquo;t be used unless you know what
you&rsquo;re doing.

A sample
configuration file is shown below:

# Daemon
options 
data_portrange = 10000 - 10100 
# Access list 
scan-client.somedomain.firm 
# this is a comment 
192.168.0.1 
192.168.2.12/29 
[::1] 
[2001:db8:185e::42:12]/64

The case of the
host names does not matter, so AHost.COM is considered
identical to ahost.com.

FILES

/etc/hosts.equiv

The hosts listed in this file
are permitted to access all local SANE devices. Caveat: this
file imposes serious security risks and its use is not
recommended.

/etc/sane.d/saned.conf

Contains a list of hosts
permitted to access local SANE devices (see also description
of SANE_CONFIG_DIR below).

/etc/sane.d/saned.users

If this file contains lines of
the form

user:password:backend

access to the
listed backends is restricted. A backend may be listed
multiple times for different user/password combinations. The
server uses MD5 hashing if supported by the client.

ENVIRONMENT

SANE_CONFIG_DIR

This environment variable
specifies the list of directories that may contain the
configuration file. On *NIX systems, the directories are
separated by a colon (&rsquo;:&rsquo;), under OS/2, they are
separated by a semi-colon (&rsquo;;&rsquo;). If this
variable is not set, the configuration file is searched in
two default directories: first, the current working
directory (".") and then in /etc/sane.d. If
the value of the environment variable ends with the
directory separator character, then the default directories
are searched after the explicitly specified directories. For
example, setting SANE_CONFIG_DIR to
"/tmp/config:" would result in directories
tmp/config, ., and /etc/sane.d being
searched (in this order).

NOTES

saned
does not provide confidentiality when communicating
with clients. If saned is exposed directly on the
network, other users may be able to intercept scanned
images, or learn passwords for connecting to saned,
with little effort. Client systems should connect to
saned through a secure tunnel to the server
instead.

saned is
not a trusted program and should not run with root
privileges.

/usr/share/doc/libsane/saned/saned.install.md for
details on configuring saned as a service.
