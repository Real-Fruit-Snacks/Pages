NAME

humount -
remove an HFS volume from the list of known volumes

SYNOPSIS

humount
[volume-name-or-path]

DESCRIPTION

humount
is used to forget about an HFS volume previously mounted
with hmount. Either the volume&rsquo;s name or the
UNIX path to the volume may be used to specify the volume.
If no name or path is given, the current volume is
assumed.

NOTES

It is not
strictly necessary to use this command. It does not affect
any physical volumes; it only updates the file named
.hcwd in the user&rsquo;s home directory used to keep
track of the currently known HFS volumes.

SEE ALSO
