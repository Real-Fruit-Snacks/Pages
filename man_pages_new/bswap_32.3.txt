NAME

bswap_16,
bswap_32, bswap_64 - reverse order of bytes

SYNOPSIS

#include

bswap_16(x);

bswap_32(x); 
bswap_64(x);

DESCRIPTION

These macros
return a value in which the order of the bytes in their 2-,
4-, or 8-byte arguments is reversed.

RETURN VALUE

These macros
return the value of their argument with the bytes
reversed.

ERRORS

These macros
always succeed.

CONFORMING TO

These macros
are GNU extensions.

EXAMPLES

The program
below swaps the bytes of the 8-byte integer supplied as its
command-line argument. The following shell session
demonstrates the use of the program:

$
./a.out 0x0123456789abcdef

0x123456789abcdef ==> 0xefcdab8967452301

main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    uint64_t x;

    if (argc != 2) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Usage: %s \n", argv[0]);
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    x = strtoull(argv[1], NULL, 0);
    printf("%#" PRIx64 " ==> %#" PRIx64 "\n", x, bswap_64(x));

    exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
