NAME

plzip - reduces
the size of files

SYNOPSIS

plzip
[options] [files]

DESCRIPTION

Plzip is a
massively parallel (multi-threaded) implementation of lzip,
compatible with lzip 1.4 or newer. Plzip uses the
compression library lzlib.

Lzip is a
lossless data compressor with a user interface similar to
the one of gzip or bzip2. Lzip uses a simplified form of the
&rsquo;Lempel-Ziv-Markov chain-Algorithm&rsquo; (LZMA)
stream format to maximize interoperability. The maximum
dictionary size is 512 MiB so that any lzip file can be
decompressed on 32-bit machines. Lzip provides accurate and
robust 3-factor integrity checking. Lzip can compress about
as fast as gzip (lzip -0) or compress most files more
than bzip2 (lzip -9). Decompression speed is
intermediate between gzip and bzip2. Lzip is better than
gzip and bzip2 from a data recovery perspective. Lzip has
been designed, written, and tested with great care to
replace gzip and bzip2 as the standard general-purpose
compressed format for Unix-like systems.

Plzip can
compress/decompress large files on multiprocessor machines
much faster than lzip, at the cost of a slightly reduced
compression ratio (0.4 to 2 percent larger compressed
files). Note that the number of usable threads is limited by
file size; on files larger than a few GB plzip can use
hundreds of processors, but on files of only a few MB plzip
is no faster than lzip.

If no file
names are given, or if a file is &rsquo;-&rsquo;, plzip
compresses or decompresses from standard input to standard
output. Numbers may be followed by a multiplier: k = kB =
10^3 = 1000, Ki = KiB = 2^10 = 1024, M = 10^6, Mi = 2^20, G
= 10^9, Gi = 2^30, etc... Dictionary sizes 12 to 29 are
interpreted as powers of two, meaning 2^12 to 2^29
bytes.

The
bidimensional parameter space of LZMA can&rsquo;t be mapped
to a linear scale optimal for all files. If your files are
large, very repetitive, etc, you may need to use the options
--dictionary-size and --match-length directly
to achieve optimal performance.

To extract all
the files from archive &rsquo;foo.tar.lz&rsquo;, use the
commands &rsquo;tar -xf foo.tar.lz&rsquo; or
&rsquo;plzip -cd foo.tar.lz | tar -xf
-&rsquo;.

Exit status: 0
for a normal exit, 1 for environmental problems (file not
found, invalid command-line options, I/O errors, etc), 2 to
indicate a corrupt or invalid input file, 3 for an internal
consistency error (e.g., bug) which caused plzip to
panic.
