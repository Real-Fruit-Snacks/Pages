NAME

gh-repo-clone -
Clone a repository locally

SYNOPSIS

gh repo
clone  [] [--
...]

DESCRIPTION

Clone a GitHub
repository locally. Pass additional git clone flags
by listing them after --.

If the
OWNER/ portion of the OWNER/REPO repository
argument is omitted, it defaults to the name of the
authenticating user.

If the
repository is a fork, its parent repository will be added as
an additional git remote called upstream. The remote
name can be configured using --upstream-remote-name.
The --upstream-remote-name option supports an
@owner value which will name the remote after the
owner of the parent repository.

If the
repository is a fork, its parent repository will be set as
the default remote repository.

OPTIONS

"upstream")
