NAME

$HOME/.rhosts -
grants or denies password-free r-command access to a
specific user account

DESCRIPTION

The
.rhosts file allows or denies a user who has an
account on the local host to use the r-commands (e.g.
rlogin, rsh or rcp) without supplying a
password.

The file uses
the following format: 
hostname [username]

Such an entry
grants password-free r-command access for the user
with the login name username from the remote host
hostname. If no user name is specified, the user must
have the same login name on the remote host and the local
host. For security reasons you should always use the FQDN of
the hostname and not the short hostname.

Netgroups can
be specified by preceeding the netgroup by an @ sign.

The
.rhosts file must be owned by the user or root, and
writable only by the owner.
