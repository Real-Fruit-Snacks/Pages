NAME

dhcpinfo
&minus; display values of parameters received through
DHCP

SYNOPSIS

dhcpinfo
[ -c ] [-i interface] [-n
limit ] code

dhcpinfo
[ -c ] [-i interface] [-n
limit ] identifier

DESCRIPTION

The
dhcpinfo utility prints the DHCP-supplied
value(s) of the parameter requested on the command line. The
parameter may be identified either by its numeric code in
the DHCP specification, or by its mnemonic
identifier, as listed in dhcp_inittab(4). This
command is intended to be used in command substitutions in
the shell scripts invoked by init(1M) at system boot.
It first contacts the DHCP client daemon
dhcpagent(1M) to verify that DHCP has
successfully completed on the requested interface. If
DHCP has successfully completed on the requested
interface, dhcpinfo retrieves the values for the
requested parameter. Parameter values echoed by
dhcpinfo should not be used without checking its exit
status. See EXIT STATUS.

See
dhcp_inittab(4) for the list of mnemonic identifier
codes for all DHCP parameters. See RFC 2132, DHCP
Options and BOOTP Vendor Extensions for more detail.

Output
Format 
The output from dhcpinfo consists of one or more
lines of ASCII text; the format of the output depends
upon the requested parameter. The number of values returned
per line and the total number of lines output for a given
parameter are determined by the parameter&rsquo;s
granularity and maximum values, respectively,
as defined by dhcp_inittab(4).

The format of
each individual value is determined by the data type of the
option, as determined by dhcp_inittab(4). The
possible data types and their formats are listed below:

OPTIONS

The following
options are supported:

-c

Displays the output in a canonical format. This format
is identical to the OCTET format with a granularity
of 1.

-i interface

Specifies the interface to
retrieve values for DHCP parameters from. If this
option is not specified, the primary interface is used.

-n limit

Limits the list of values
displayed to limit lines.

OPERANDS

The following
operands are supported:

code

Numeric code for the requested DHCP parameter, as
defined by the DHCP specification. Vendor options are
specified by adding 256 to the actual vendor code.

identifier

Mnemonic symbol for the
requested DHCP parameter, as listed in
dhcp_inittab(4).

EXIT STATUS

The following
exit values are returned:

0

Successful operation.

2

The operation was not successful. The DHCP client
daemon may not be running, the interface might have failed
to configure, or no satisfactory DHCP responses were
received. 

3

Bad arguments.

4

The operation timed out.

6

Some system error (should never occur).

ATTRIBUTES
