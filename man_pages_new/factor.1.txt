NAME

factor, primes
- factor a number, generate large primes

SYNOPSIS

factor [
number ]

primes [
start [ finish ] ]

DESCRIPTION

Factor
prints number and its prime factors, each repeated
the proper number of times. The number must be positive and
less than 2**54 (about 1.8e16)

If no
number is given, factor reads a stream of
numbers from the standard input and factors them. It exits
on any input not a positive integer. Maximum running time is
proportional to sqrt(n).

Primes
prints the prime numbers ranging from start to
finish, where start and finish are
positive numbers less than 2**56. If finish is
missing, primes prints without end; if start
is missing, it reads the starting number from the standard
input.
