PKGCONF(1) BSD General Commands Manual PKGCONF(1)

NAME

pkgconf &mdash; a system
for configuring build dependency information

SYNOPSIS

pkgconf [options]
[list of modules]

DESCRIPTION

pkgconf is a program
which helps to configure compiler and linker flags for
development libraries. This allows build systems to detect
other dependencies and use them with the system
toolchain.

GENERAL OPTIONS 
--version

Display the supported
pkg-config version and exit.

--atleast-pkgconfig-version=VERSION

Exit with error if we do not
support the requested pkg-config version.

--errors-to-stdout

Print all errors on the main
output stream instead of the error output stream.

--silence-errors

Do not display any errors at
all.

--list-all

Walk all directories listed in
the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environmental variable and
display information on packages which have registered
information there.

--simulate

Simulates resolving a
dependency graph based on the requested modules on the
command line. Dumps a series of trees denoting
pkgconf&rsquo;s resolver state.

--no-cache

Skip caching packages when they
are loaded into the internal resolver. This may result in an
alternate dependency graph being computed.

--ignore-conflicts

Ignore &rsquo;Conflicts&rsquo;
rules in modules.

--env-only

Learn about pkgconf&rsquo;s
configuration strictly from environmental variables.

--validate package
...

Validate specific
&rsquo;.pc&rsquo; files for correctness.

--maximum-traverse-depth=DEPTH

Impose a limit on the allowed
depth in the dependency graph. For example, a depth of 2
will restrict the resolver from acting on child dependencies
of modules added to the resolver&rsquo;s solution.

--static

Compute a deeper dependency
graph and use compiler/linker flags intended for static
linking.

--shared

Compute a simple dependency
graph that is only suitable for shared linking.

--pure

Treats the
computed dependency graph as if it were pure. This is mainly
intended for use with the --static flag.

--no-provides

Ignore &rsquo;Provides&rsquo;
rules in modules when resolving dependencies.

--with-path=PATH

Adds a new module search path
to pkgconf&rsquo;s dependency resolver. Paths added in this
way are given preference before other paths.

--define-prefix

Attempts to determine the
prefix variable to use for CFLAGS and LIBS entry
relocations. This is mainly useful for platforms where
framework SDKs are relocatable, such as Windows.

--dont-define-prefix

Disables the
&rsquo;define-prefix&rsquo; feature.

--prefix-variable=VARIABLE

Sets the &rsquo;prefix&rsquo;
variable used by the &rsquo;define-prefix&rsquo;
feature.

--relocate=PATH

Relocates a path using the
pkgconf_path_relocate API. This is mainly used by the
testsuite to provide a guaranteed interface to the
system&rsquo;s path relocation backend.

--dont-relocate-paths

Disables the path relocation
feature.

MODULE-SPECIFIC OPTIONS 
--atleast-version=VERSION

Exit with error if a
module&rsquo;s version is less than the specified
version.

--exact-version=VERSION

Exit with error if a
module&rsquo;s version is not exactly the specified
version.

--max-version=VERSION

Exit with error if a
module&rsquo;s version is greater than the specified
version.

--exists

Exit with a non-zero result if
the dependency resolver was unable to find all of the
requested modules.

--uninstalled

Exit with a non-zero result if
the dependency resolver uses an &rsquo;uninstalled&rsquo;
module as part of its solution.

--no-uninstalled

Forbids the dependency resolver
from considering &rsquo;uninstalled&rsquo; modules as part
of a solution.

QUERY-SPECIFIC OPTIONS 
--cflags, --cflags-only-I,
--cflags-only-other

Display either all CFLAGS, only
-I CFLAGS or only CFLAGS that are not -I.

--libs,
--libs-only-L, --libs-only-l,
--libs-only-other

Display either all linker
flags, only -L linker flags, only -l linker
flags or only linker flags that are not -L or
-l.

--keep-system-cflags,
--keep-system-libs

Keep CFLAGS or linker flag
fragments that would be filtered due to being included by
default in the compiler.

--define-variable=VARNAME=VALUE

Define VARNAME as
VALUE. Variables are used in query output, and some
modules&rsquo; results may change based on the presence of a
variable definition.

--print-variables

Print all seen variables for a
module to the output channel.

--print-provides

Print all relevant
&rsquo;Provides&rsquo; entries for a module to the output
channel.

--variable=VARNAME

Print the value of
VARNAME.

--print-requires,
--print-requires-private

Print the modules included in
either the Requires field or the
Requires.private field.

--digraph

Dump the dependency
resolver&rsquo;s solution as a graphviz &rsquo;dot&rsquo;
file. This can be used with graphviz to visualize module
interdependencies.

--path

Display the
filenames of the &rsquo;.pc&rsquo; files used by the
dependency resolver for a given dependency set.

--env=VARNAME

Print the requested values as
variable declarations in a similar format as the env(1)
command.

--fragment-filter=TYPES

Filter the fragment lists for
the specified types.

--modversion

Print the version of the
queried module.

ENVIRONMENT 
PKG_CONFIG_PATH

List of secondary directories
where &rsquo;.pc&rsquo; files are looked up.

PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR

List of primary directories
where &rsquo;.pc&rsquo; files are looked up.

PKG_CONFIG_SYSROOT_DIR

&rsquo;sysroot&rsquo;
directory, will be prepended to every path defined in
PKG_CONFIG_PATH. Useful for cross compilation.

PKG_CONFIG_TOP_BUILD_DIR

Provides an alternative setting
for the &rsquo;pc_top_builddir&rsquo; global variable.

PKG_CONFIG_PURE_DEPGRAPH

If set, enables the same
behaviour as the --pure flag.

PKG_CONFIG_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH

List of paths that are
considered system include paths by the toolchain. This is a
pkgconf-specific extension.

PKG_CONFIG_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH

List of paths that are
considered system library paths by the toolchain. This is a
pkgconf-specific extension.

PKG_CONFIG_DISABLE_UNINSTALLED

If set, enables the same
behaviour as the --no-uninstalled flag.

PKG_CONFIG_LOG

&rsquo;logfile&rsquo; which is
used for dumping audit information concerning installed
module versions.

PKG_CONFIG_DEBUG_SPEW

If set, enables additional
debug logging. The format of the debug log messages is
implementation-specific.

PKG_CONFIG_DONT_RELOCATE_PATHS

If set, disables the path
relocation feature.

PKG_CONFIG_MSVC_SYNTAX

If set, uses MSVC syntax for
fragments.

PKG_CONFIG_FDO_SYSROOT_RULES

If set, follow the sysroot
prefixing rules that freedesktop.org pkg-config uses.

DESTDIR

If set to
PKG_CONFIG_SYSROOT_DIR, assume that
PKG_CONFIG_FDO_SYSROOT_RULES is set.

EXAMPLES

Displaying the CFLAGS of a
package:

$ pkgconf --cflags foo 
-fPIC -I/usr/include/foo
