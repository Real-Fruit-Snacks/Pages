NAME

linux&minus;version
&minus; operate on Linux kernel version strings

SYNOPSIS

linux&minus;version compare VERSION1 OP VERSION2 

linux&minus;version sort [&minus;&minus;reverse]
[VERSION1 VERSION2 ...] 

linux&minus;version list [&minus;&minus;paths] 

DESCRIPTION

linux&minus;version
operates on Linux kernel version strings as reported by
uname -r and used in file and directory names. These
version strings do not follow the same rules as Debian
package version strings and should not be compared as such
or as arbitrary strings. 
compare VERSION1 OP VERSION2

Compare version strings, where
OP is a binary operator. linux&minus;version
returns success (zero result) if the specified condition is
satisfied, and failure (nonzero result) otherwise. The valid
operators are: lt le eq ne ge gt

sort
[&minus;&minus;reverse] [VERSION1 VERSION2
...]

Sort the given version strings
and print them in order from lowest to highest. If the
&minus;&minus;reverse option is used, print them in
order from highest to lowest.

If no version
strings are given as arguments, the version strings will
instead be read from standard input, one per line. They may
be suffixed by arbitrary text after a space, which will be
included in the output. This means that, for example:

linux&minus;version list &minus;&minus;paths | linux&minus;version sort &minus;&minus;reverse

will list the
installed versions and corresponding paths in order from
highest to lowest version.

list
[&minus;&minus;paths]

List kernel versions installed
in the customary location. If the &minus;&minus;paths
option, show the corresponding path for each version.
