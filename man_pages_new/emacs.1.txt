DESCRIPTION

GNU
Emacs is a version of Emacs, written by the
author of the original (PDP-10) Emacs, Richard
Stallman. 
The primary documentation of GNU Emacs is in the GNU Emacs
Manual, which you can read using Info, either from Emacs or
as a standalone program. Please look there for complete and
up-to-date documentation. This man page is updated only when
someone volunteers to do so; the Emacs maintainers&rsquo;
priority goal is to minimize the amount of time this man
page takes away from other more useful projects. 
The user functionality of GNU Emacs encompasses everything
other Emacs editors do, and it is easily extensible
since its editing commands are written in Lisp.

Emacs
has an extensive interactive help facility, but the facility
assumes that you know how to manipulate Emacs windows
and buffers. CTRL-h or F1 enters the Help facility. Help
Tutorial (CTRL-h t) starts an interactive tutorial which can
teach beginners the fundamentals of Emacs in a few
minutes. Help Apropos (CTRL-h a) helps you find a command
given its functionality, Help Character (CTRL-h c) describes
a given character&rsquo;s effect, and Help Function (CTRL-h
f) describes a given Lisp function specified by name.

Emacs&rsquo;s
Undo can undo several steps of modification to your buffers,
so it is easy to recover from editing mistakes.

GNU
Emacs&rsquo;s many special packages handle mail reading
(RMail) and sending (Mail), outline editing (Outline),
compiling (Compile), running subshells within Emacs
windows (Shell), running a Lisp read-eval-print loop
(Lisp-Interaction-Mode), automated psychotherapy (Doctor),
and much more.

There is an
extensive reference manual, but users of other Emacses
should have little trouble adapting even without a copy.
Users new to Emacs will be able to use basic features
fairly rapidly by studying the tutorial and using the
self-documentation features.

Emacs
Options 
The following options are of general interest:

file

Edit file.

&minus;&minus;file
file, &minus;&minus;find-file file,
&minus;&minus;visit file

The same as specifying
file directly as an argument.

+number

Go to the line specified by number (do not insert
a space between the "+" sign and the number). This
applies only to the next file specified.

+line:column

Go to the specified line
and column.

&minus;q,
&minus;&minus;no&minus;init&minus;file

Do not load an init file.

&minus;&minus;no&minus;site&minus;file

Do not load the site-wide
startup file.

&minus;&minus;no&minus;desktop

Do not load a saved
desktop.

&minus;nl,
&minus;&minus;no&minus;shared&minus;memory

Do not use shared memory.

&minus;Q,
&minus;&minus;quick

Equivalent to "&minus;q
&minus;&minus;no&minus;site&minus;file
&minus;&minus;no&minus;splash".

&minus;&minus;no&minus;splash

Do not display a splash screen
during start-up.

&minus;&minus;debug&minus;init

Enable Emacs Lisp
debugger during the processing of the user init file
~/.emacs. This is useful for debugging problems in
the init file.

&minus;u user,
&minus;&minus;user user

Load user&rsquo;s init
file.

&minus;t file,
&minus;&minus;terminal file

Use specified file as
the terminal instead of using stdin/stdout. This must be the
first argument specified in the command line.

&minus;&minus;multibyte,
&minus;&minus;no-unibyte

Enable multibyte mode (enabled
by default).

&minus;&minus;unibyte,
&minus;&minus;no-multibyte

Enable unibyte mode.

&minus;&minus;version

Display Emacs version
information and exit.

&minus;&minus;help

Display this help and exit.

The following
options are lisp-oriented (these options are processed in
the order encountered):

&minus;f
function, &minus;&minus;funcall
function

Execute the lisp function
function.

&minus;l file,
&minus;&minus;load file

Load the lisp code in the file
file.

&minus;&minus;eval
expr, &minus;&minus;execute expr

Evaluate the Lisp expression
expr.

The following
options are useful when running Emacs as a batch
editor:

&minus;&minus;batch

Edit in batch mode. The editor will send messages to
stderr. This option must be the first in the argument list.
You must use &minus;l and &minus;f options to specify files
to execute and functions to call.

&minus;&minus;script
file

Run file as an Emacs
Lisp script.

&minus;&minus;insert
file

Insert contents of file
into the current buffer.

&minus;&minus;kill

Exit Emacs while in batch mode.

&minus;L dir,
&minus;&minus;directory dir

Add dir to the list of
directories Emacs searches for Lisp files.

Using Emacs
with X 
Emacs has been tailored to work well with the X window
system. If you run Emacs from under X windows, it
will create its own X window to display in. You will
probably want to start the editor as a background process so
that you can continue using your original window.

Emacs
can be started with the following X switches:

&minus;&minus;name
name

Specify the name which should
be assigned to the initial Emacs window. This
controls looking up X resources as well as the window
title.

&minus;T name,
&minus;&minus;title name

Specify the title for the
initial X window.

&minus;r,
&minus;rv,
&minus;&minus;reverse&minus;video

Display the Emacs window
in reverse video.

&minus;fn font,
&minus;&minus;font font

Set the Emacs
window&rsquo;s font to that specified by font. You
will find the various X fonts in the
/usr/lib/X11/fonts directory. Note that Emacs
will only accept fixed width fonts. Under the X11 Release 4
font-naming conventions, any font with the value
"m" or "c" in the eleventh field of the
font name is a fixed width font. Furthermore, fonts whose
name are of the form widthxheight are
generally fixed width, as is the font fixed. See
xlsfonts(1) for more information.

When you
specify a font, be sure to put a space between the switch
and the font name.

&minus;&minus;xrm
resources

Set additional X resources.

&minus;&minus;color,
&minus;&minus;color=mode

Override color mode for
character terminals; mode defaults to
&rsquo;auto&rsquo;, and can also be &rsquo;never&rsquo;,
&rsquo;auto&rsquo;, &rsquo;always&rsquo;, or a mode name
like &rsquo;ansi8&rsquo;.

&minus;bw pixels,
&minus;&minus;border&minus;width pixels

Set the Emacs
window&rsquo;s border width to the number of pixels
specified by pixels. Defaults to one pixel on each
side of the window.

&minus;ib pixels,
&minus;&minus;internal&minus;border pixels

Set the window&rsquo;s internal
border width to the number of pixels specified by
pixels. Defaults to one pixel of padding on each side
of the window.

&minus;g
geometry, &minus;&minus;geometry
geometry

Set the Emacs
window&rsquo;s width, height, and position as specified. The
geometry specification is in the standard X format; see
X(7) for more information. The width and height are
specified in characters; the default is 80 by 24. See the
Emacs manual, section "Options for Window Size and
Position", for information on how window sizes interact
with selecting or deselecting the tool bar and menu bar.

&minus;lsp
pixels, &minus;&minus;line&minus;spacing
pixels

Additional space to put between
lines.

&minus;vb,
&minus;&minus;vertical&minus;scroll&minus;bars

Enable vertical scrollbars.

&minus;fh,
&minus;&minus;fullheight

Make the first frame as high as
the screen.

&minus;fs,
&minus;&minus;fullscreen

Make the first frame
fullscreen.

&minus;fw,
&minus;&minus;fullwidth

Make the first frame as wide as
the screen.

&minus;fg color,
&minus;&minus;foreground&minus;color color

On color displays, set the
color of the text.

Use the command
M&minus;x list&minus;colors&minus;display for a list
of valid color names.

&minus;bg color,
&minus;&minus;background&minus;color color

On color displays, set the
color of the window&rsquo;s background.

&minus;bd color,
&minus;&minus;border&minus;color color

On color displays, set the
color of the window&rsquo;s border.

&minus;cr color,
&minus;&minus;cursor&minus;color color

On color displays, set the
color of the window&rsquo;s text cursor.

&minus;ms color,
&minus;&minus;mouse&minus;color color

On color displays, set the
color of the window&rsquo;s mouse cursor.

&minus;d
displayname, &minus;&minus;display
displayname

Create the Emacs window
on the display specified by displayname. Must be the
first option specified in the command line.

&minus;nbi,
&minus;&minus;no&minus;bitmap&minus;icon

Do not use picture of gnu for
Emacs icon.

&minus;&minus;iconic

Start Emacs in iconified
state.

&minus;nbc,
&minus;&minus;no&minus;blinking&minus;cursor

Disable blinking cursor.

&minus;nw,
&minus;&minus;no&minus;window&minus;system

Tell Emacs not to use
its special interface to X. If you use this switch when
invoking Emacs from an xterm(1) window,
display is done in that window.

&minus;D,
&minus;&minus;basic&minus;display

This option disables many
display features; use it for debugging Emacs.

You can set
X default values for your Emacs windows in
your .Xresources file (see xrdb(1)). Use the
following format:

emacs.keyword:value

where
value specifies the default value of keyword.
Emacs lets you set default values for the following
keywords:

background (class
Background)

For color displays, sets the
window&rsquo;s background color.

bitmapIcon (class
BitmapIcon)

If bitmapIcon&rsquo;s
value is set to on, the window will iconify into the
"kitchen sink."

borderColor (class
BorderColor)

For color displays, sets the
color of the window&rsquo;s border.

borderWidth (class
BorderWidth)

Sets the window&rsquo;s border
width in pixels.

cursorColor (class
Foreground)

For color displays, sets the
color of the window&rsquo;s text cursor.

cursorBlink (class
CursorBlink)

Specifies whether to make the
cursor blink. The default is on. Use off or
false to turn cursor blinking off.

font (class
Font)

Sets the window&rsquo;s text
font.

foreground (class
Foreground)

For color displays, sets the
window&rsquo;s text color.

The value can be one of fullboth, fullwidth,
or fullheight, which correspond to the command-line
options &rsquo;&minus;fs&rsquo;, &rsquo;&minus;fw&rsquo;,
and &rsquo;&minus;fh&rsquo;, respectively. Note that this
applies to the initial frame only.

Additional space
("leading") between lines, in pixels.

menuBar (class
MenuBar)

Gives frames menu bars if
on; don&rsquo;t have menu bars if off. See the
Emacs manual, sections "Lucid Resources" and
"LessTif Resources", for how to control the
appearance of the menu bar if you have one.

minibuffer (class
Minibuffer)

If none, don&rsquo;t
make a minibuffer in this frame. It will use a separate
minibuffer frame instead.

paneFont (class
Font)

Font name for menu pane titles,
in non-toolkit versions of Emacs.

pointerColor (class
Foreground)

For color displays, sets the
color of the window&rsquo;s mouse cursor.

it.

reverseVideo (class
ReverseVideo)

If reverseVideo&rsquo;s
value is set to on, the window will be displayed in
reverse video.

screenGamma (class
ScreenGamma)

Gamma correction for colors,
equivalent to the frame parameter
&rsquo;screen&minus;gamma&rsquo;.

items, in non-toolkit versions of Emacs. (For toolkit
versions, see the Emacs manual, sections "Lucid
Resources" and "LessTif Resources".)

selectionTimeout (class
SelectionTimeout)

Number of milliseconds to wait
for a selection reply. A value of 0 means wait as long as

on; suppresses scroll bars if off.

visualClass (class
VisualClass)

Specify the "visual"
that X should use. This tells X how to handle colors. The
value should start with one of TrueColor,
PseudoColor, DirectColor, StaticColor,
GrayScale, and StaticGray, followed by
&minus;depth, where depth is the number
of color planes.

If you try to
set color values while using a black and white display, the
window&rsquo;s characteristics will default as follows: the
foreground color will be set to black, the background color
will be set to white, the border color will be set to grey,
and the text and mouse cursors will be set to black.

The following lists some of the mouse button bindings for
the Emacs window under X11.

MANUALS

You can order
printed copies of the GNU Emacs Manual from the Free
Software Foundation, which develops GNU software. See the
file ORDERS for ordering information. 
Your local Emacs maintainer might also have copies
available. As with all software and publications from FSF,
everyone is permitted to make and distribute copies of the
Emacs manual. The TeX source to the manual is also included
in the Emacs source distribution.

FILES

/usr/share/info
&mdash; files for the Info documentation browser. The
complete text of the Emacs reference manual is included in a
convenient tree structured form. Also includes the Emacs
Lisp Reference Manual, useful to anyone wishing to write
programs in the Emacs Lisp extension language.

/usr/share/emacs/$VERSION/lisp
&mdash; Lisp source files and compiled files that define
most editing commands. Some are preloaded; others are
autoloaded from this directory when used.

/usr/lib/emacs/$VERSION/$ARCH
&mdash; various programs that are used with GNU Emacs.

/usr/share/emacs/$VERSION/etc
&mdash; various files of information.

/usr/share/emacs/$VERSION/etc/DOC.*
&mdash; contains the documentation strings for the Lisp
primitives and preloaded Lisp functions of GNU Emacs. They
are stored here to reduce the size of Emacs proper.

/usr/share/emacs/$VERSION/etc/SERVICE
lists people offering various services to assist users of
GNU Emacs, including education, troubleshooting, porting and
customization.

BUGS

There is a
mailing list, bug-gnu-emacs [AT] gnu.org, for reporting Emacs
bugs and fixes. But before reporting something as a bug,
please try to be sure that it really is a bug, not a
misunderstanding or a deliberate feature. We ask you to read
the section &rsquo;&rsquo;Reporting Emacs Bugs&rsquo;&rsquo;
near the end of the reference manual (or Info system) for
hints on how and when to report bugs. Also, include the
version number of the Emacs you are running in every
bug report that you send in. Bugs tend actually to be fixed
if they can be isolated, so it is in your interest to report
them in such a way that they can be easily reproduced.

Do not expect a
personal answer to a bug report. The purpose of reporting
bugs is to get them fixed for everyone in the next release,
if possible. For personal assistance, look in the SERVICE
file (see above) for a list of people who offer it.

Please do not
send anything but bug reports to this mailing list. For more
information about Emacs mailing lists, see the file
/usr/share/emacs/$VERSION/etc/MAILINGLISTS.

UNRESTRICTIONS

Emacs is
free; anyone may redistribute copies of Emacs to
anyone under the terms stated in the Emacs General
Public License, a copy of which accompanies each copy of
Emacs and which also appears in the reference
manual.

Copies of
Emacs may sometimes be received packaged with
distributions of Unix systems, but it is never included in
the scope of any license covering those systems. Such
inclusion violates the terms on which distribution is
permitted. In fact, the primary purpose of the General
Public License is to prohibit anyone from attaching any
other restrictions to redistribution of Emacs.

Richard
Stallman encourages you to improve and extend Emacs,
and urges that you contribute your extensions to the GNU
library. Eventually GNU (Gnu&rsquo;s Not Unix) will be a
complete replacement for Unix. Everyone will be free to use,
copy, study and change the GNU system.
