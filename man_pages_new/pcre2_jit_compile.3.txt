NAME

PCRE2 -
Perl-compatible regular expressions (revised API)

SYNOPSIS

#include

int
pcre2_jit_compile(pcre2_code *code,
uint32_t options);

DESCRIPTION

This function
requests JIT compilation, which, if the just-in-time
compiler is available, further processes a compiled pattern
into machine code that executes much faster than the
pcre2_match() interpretive matching function. Full
details are given in the pcre2jit documentation.

The first
argument is a pointer that was returned by a successful call
to pcre2_compile(), and the second must contain one
or more of the following bits:

PCRE2_JIT_COMPLETE
compile code for full matching 
PCRE2_JIT_PARTIAL_SOFT compile code for soft partial
matching 
PCRE2_JIT_PARTIAL_HARD compile code for hard partial
matching

There is also
an obsolete option called PCRE2_JIT_INVALID_UTF, which has
been superseded by the pcre2_compile() option
PCRE2_MATCH_INVALID_UTF. The old option is deprecated and
may be removed in the future.

The yield of
the function is 0 for success, or a negative error code
otherwise. In particular, PCRE2_ERROR_JIT_BADOPTION is
returned if JIT is not supported or if an unknown bit is set
in options. The function can also return
PCRE2_ERROR_NOMEMORY if JIT is unable to allocate executable
memory for the compiler, even if it was because of a system
security restriction.

There is a
complete description of the PCRE2 native API in the
pcre2api page and a description of the POSIX API in
the pcre2posix page.
