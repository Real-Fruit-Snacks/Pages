NAME

fonttosfnt
&minus; Wrap a bitmap font in a sfnt (TrueType) wrapper

SYNOPSIS

fonttosfnt
[ options ] &minus;o file.ttf [
&minus;&minus; ] font...

DESCRIPTION

Wrap a bitmap
font or a set of bitmap fonts in a sfnt (TrueType or
OpenType) wrapper.

OPTIONS

&minus;v

Be verbose.

&minus;c

Do not crop glyphs. This usually increases file size,
but may sometimes yield a modest decrease in file size for
small character cell fonts (terminal fonts).

&minus;b

Write byte-aligned glyph data. By default, unaligned
data is written, which yields a smaller file size.

&minus;r

Do not reencode fonts. By default, fonts are reencoded
to Unicode whenever possible.

&minus;g n

Set the type of scalable glyphs that we write. If
n is 0, no scalable glyphs are written; this is legal
but confuses most current software. If n is 1, a
single scalable glyph (the undefined glyph) is written; this
is recommended, but triggers a bug in current versions of
FreeType. If n is 2 (the default), a
sufficiently high number of blank glyphs are written, which
works with FreeType but increases file size.

&minus;m n

Set the type of scalable metrics that we write. If
n is 0, no scalable metrics are written, which may or
may not be legal. If n is 1, full metrics for a
single glyph are written, and only left sidebearing values
are written for the other glyphs. If n is 2, scalable
metrics for all glyphs are written, which increases file
size and is not recommended. The default is 1.

&minus;&minus;

End of options.

BUGS

Some of the
font-level values, notably sub- and superscript positions,
are dummy values.
