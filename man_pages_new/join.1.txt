NAME

join -
relational database operator

SYNOPSIS

join [
options ] file1 file2

DESCRIPTION

Join
forms, on the standard output, a join of the two relations
specified by the lines of file1 and file2. If
one of the file names is the standard input is used.

File1
and file2 must be sorted in increasing
ASCII collating sequence on the fields on
which they are to be joined, normally the first in each
line.

There is one
line in the output for each pair of lines in file1
and file2 that have identical join fields. The output
line normally consists of the common field, then the rest of
the line from file1, then the rest of the line from
file2.

Input fields
are normally separated spaces or tabs; output fields by
space. In this case, multiple separators count as one, and
leading separators are discarded.

The following
options are recognized, with POSIX syntax.

-a n

In addition to the normal output, produce a line for
each unpairable line in file n, where n is 1
or 2.

-v n

Like -a, omitting output for paired lines.

-e s

Replace empty output fields by string s.

-1 m

-2 m

Join on the mth field of file1 or
file2. 

-jn m

Archaic equivalent for -n m.

-ofields

Each output line comprises the
designated fields. The comma-separated field designators are
either 0, meaning the join field, or have the form
n.m, where n is a file number and
m is a field number. Archaic usage allows separate
arguments for field designators.

-tc

Use character c as the only separator (tab
character) on input and output. Every appearance of c
in a line is significant.

EXAMPLES

sort
/etc/passwd | join -t: -1 1 -a 1 -e "" - bdays

Add birthdays to the
/etc/passwd file, leaving unknown birthdays empty.
The layout of /adm/users is given in
passwd(5); bdays contains sorted lines
like

tr : &rsquo; &rsquo;
temp 
join -1 3 -2 3 -o 1.1,2.1 temp temp | awk &rsquo;$1 

Print all pairs of users with
identical userids.

BUGS

With default
field separation, the collating sequence is that of sort
-b -ky,y; with -t, the
sequence is that of sort -tx
-ky,y.

One of the
files must be randomly accessible.
