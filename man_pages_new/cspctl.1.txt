NAME

cspctl - Sound
Blaster 16 ASP/CSP control program

SYNOPSIS

cspctl
command [-options] 

DESCRIPTION

cspctl
is a simple CSP microcode loader for Creative Sound Blaster
16ASP and some Sound Blaster AWE32 sound cards with Creative
Signal Processor (CSP) chip (CT1748A) installed.
cspctl can also be used as a post-install function to
snd-sb16-csp module to load default codec at module
installation. If CSP chip is successfully detected and
initialized, it will be installed as a hardware dependent
device hwC0D2 into /dev/snd directory. Currently,
following codecs can be loaded to CSP device:

wfm0001a.csp

QSound decoder

wfm0006a.csp

A-law codec

wfm0007a.csp

u-law codec

wfm0011a.csp

IMA ADPCM codec (distorted output for IMA test
files) 

wfm0200a.csp

Creative ADPCM codec (sounds like Intel/DVI IMA ADPCM
compatible) 

wfm0202a.csp

Fast Speech 8 codec

wfm0203a.csp

Fast Speech 10 codec

These codecs
are not yet supported by ALSA:

wfm0201a.csp Text2Speech
decoder 

Qsound
microcode file has four functions, each function is a
decoder for different sample rate. Rates for QSound
functions #1, #2, #3 and #4 are 44100, 22050, 11025 and
8000Hz respectively. IMA ADPCM and FastSpeech codecs are
formed of two functions, the first one is for capture
and the second one is for playback. A-law and u-law codecs
have only one function. To load for example function
#2 from QSound microcode file (decoder for 22050Hz), run as
follows:

% cspctl load -f 2 -d QSound
wfm0001a.csp 

After
successful loading, /proc/asound/SB16/cspD2 will show:

Creative Signal Processor
[v1.0] 

State: -x--L 
Codec: QSound [func #2] 
Sample rates: 22050Hz 
QSound decoder disabled

With QSound
decoder microcode loaded, all simple PCM file formats can be
played with QSound 180 degree positioning applied. QSound
element is dynamically added into mixer structure as
3DEffect1-space element. It will only show if support
for CSP has been compiled into ALSA drivers, CSP chip has
been found, and QSound codec is loaded into CSP. When
enabled, QSound position can be dynamically changed by mixer
slider, and proc interface should follow the state of CSP
chip and its current QSound position:

Creative Signal Processor
[v1.0] 

State: Qx-RL 
Codec: QSound [func #2] 
Sample rates: 22050Hz 
QSound decoder enabled 
Processing 16bit mono PCM samples 
Qsound position: left = 0x9, right = 0x9

Driver supports
autoloading of u-Law, A-Law and Ima-ADPCM hardware codecs.
Autoloading is active only when there is no microcode loaded
to CSP, and there is no need to preload appropriate *.csp
files. To unload manually loaded microcode, you should
run

% cspctl unload

If hardware
codec microcode has been manually loaded, then CSP will
support only loaded PCM format and autoloading will be
disabled. In such case, proc interface will show loaded
codec properties:

Creative Signal Processor
[v1.0] 

State: -x--L 
Codec: IMA-ADPCM [func #2] 
Sample rates: All 
PCM format ID: 0x400000 (16bit/-) [mono/stereo]
[playback/-]
