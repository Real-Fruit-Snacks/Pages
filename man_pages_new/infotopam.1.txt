NAME

infotopam -
convert Amiga .info icons to PAM

SYNOPSIS

infotopam
[-forcecolor] [-numcolors numcolors]
[-selected] [-verbose] [index color
...] [filename]

Minimum unique
abbreviation of option is acceptable. You may use double
hyphens instead of single hyphen to denote options. You may
use white space in place of the equals sign to separate an
option name from its value.

EXAMPLES

$ infotopam
amiga.info > amiga.first.pam

Use the
-selected option to convert the
&rsquo;selected&rsquo; version of the icon rather than the
regular version. Here infotopam reads from Standard
Input:

infotopam
-selected  amiga.second.pam

Use
-numcolors to change the colors.

infotopam
-numcolors 2 0 green 3 rgb:FF/00/00 icon.info >
icon.pam

Since Amiga
monitors do not use square pixels, some icons may appear
squished. Filtering the output through pamscale can
fix this:

$ infotopam
squish.info | pamtopnm | pamscale -yscale 1.7 >
normal.pnm

DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

infotopam
converts an Amiga .info (icon) image to a PAM image.
infotopam reads a .info file from filename, or
from Standard Input if you do not specify a file name, and
writes the converted PAM image to Standard Output.

infotopam
handles 1- and 2 bit-plane icons. If the .info icon has only
1 bit-plane, infotopam generates a black and white
PAM image; otherwise it generates a color PAM image. In the
latter case, you can choose the colors or keep the original
Amiga standard colors. You can force infotopam to
produce a color PAM with 1 bit-plane input with a
-forcecolor option.

OPTIONS

In addition to
the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most
notably -quiet, see
 Common Options ),
infotopam recognizes the following command line
options: 
-numcolors numcolors

This causes the program to
change the colors in the conversion. A 
2-bit-plane Amiga .icon image has four colors, numbered 0
through 3. 
Those colors are as follows.

0

Blue (00, 55, AA)

1

White (FF, FF, FF)

2

Black (00, 00, 20)

3

Orange (FF, 8A, 00)

To specify the
changes, specify the number of colors you are changing 
as the argument of -numcolors and for each color,
specify a pair 
of command line arguments, the first being the color index 0
through 3 
and the second being the color to substitute. Specify the
color 
(color) as described for the 
argument of the
pnm_parsecolor() library routine .

These
arguments go before the input file name argument, 
if any. This is an unusual syntax for a Netpbm
program.

-selected

An Amiga .info
image contains two versions of the icon: one for 
regular display and one to display when the thing
represented by 
the icon is selected. By default, infotopam converts
the 
regular icon, but this option causes it to convert the
selected icon 
instead.

-forcecolor

This causes
infotopam to convert 1 bit-plane icons to color 
PAM images instead of black and white. The colors are the
index 2 
color for black and the index 1 color for white.

-verbose

This causes
infotopam to issue informational messages about 
the conversion process.

This option was
new in Netpbm 11.06 (March 2024).

All options can
be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.

NOTES

Thanks to the
following people on comp.sys.amiga.programmer for tips and
pointers on decoding the info file format:

The format of
the Amiga .info file is as follows:

DiskObject
header 78 bytes 
Optional DrawerData header 56 bytes 
First icon header 20 bytes 
First icon data Varies 
Second icon header 20 bytes 
Second icon data Varies

The DiskObject
header contains, among other things, the magic number
(0xE310), the object width and height (inside the embedded
Gadget header), and the version.

Each icon
header contains the icon width and height, which can be
smaller than the object width and height, and the number of
bit-planes.

The icon data
has the following format:

BIT-PLANE
planes, each with HEIGHT rows of (WIDTH 
+15) / 16 * 2 bytes length.

So if you have
a 9x3x2 icon, the icon data will look like this:

aaaa aaaa a000
0000 
aaaa aaaa a000 0000 
aaaa aaaa a000 0000 
bbbb bbbb b000 0000 
bbbb bbbb b000 0000 
bbbb bbbb b000 0000

where a
is a bit for the first bit-plane, b is a bit for the
second bit-plane, and 0 is padding. Thanks again to
Ben Hutchings for his very helpful post!

HISTORY

infotopam
was new in Netpbm 10.22 (April 2004).

LIMITATIONS

infotopam
currently only handles 1 and 2 bit-plane icons.

There is no
pamtoinfo command, since the .info files contain a
lot more than just icon data, and mapping the colors would
be difficult.
