NAME

man2html -
format a manual page in html

SYNOPSIS

man2html
[options] [file]

DESCRIPTION

man2html
converts a manual page as found in file (or stdin, in
case no file argument, or the argument "-", is
given) from man-style nroff into html, and prints the result
on stdout. It does support tbl but does not know about eqn.
The exit status is 0. If something goes wrong, an error page
is printed on stdout.

This can be
used as a stand-alone utility, but is mainly intended as an
auxiliary, to enable users to browse their man pages using a
html browser like lynx(1), xmosaic(1) or
netscape(1).

The main part
of man2html is the troff-to-html engine written by
Richard Verhoeven (rcb5 [AT] win.nl). It adds hyperlinks for
the following constructs:

(The first of
these can be tuned by options - see below.) No lookup is
done - the links generated need not exist. Also an index
with internal hyperlinks to the various sections is
generated, so that it is easier to find one&rsquo;s way in
large man pages like bash(1).

OPTIONS

When reading
from stdin, it is not always clear how to do .so expansion.
The -D option allows a script to define the working
directory. 
-D pathname

Strip the last two parts from
the pathname, and do a chdir(dir) before
starting the conversion.

The -E option
allows the easy generation of error messages from a cgi
script. 
-E string

Output an error page containing
the given error message.

The general
form of a hyperlink generated for a man page reference
is

with a default
as shown above. The parts of this hyperlink are set using
the various options.

-h

Set method:cgipath to http://localhost.

-H
host[.domain][:port]

Set method:cgipath to
http://host.domain:port.

-l

Set method:cgipath to lynxcgi:/usr/lib.

-L dir

Set method:cgipath to lynxcgi:dir.

-M
man2htmlpath

Set the man2htmlpath to use.
The default is /cgi-bin/man/man2html.

-p

Set separator to &rsquo;/&rsquo;.

-q

Set separator to &rsquo;?&rsquo;. This is the
default. 

-r

Use relative html paths, instead of cgi-bin paths.

On a machine
without running httpd, one can use lynx to
browse the man pages, using the lynxcgi method. When some
http daemon is running, lynx, or any other browser, can be
used to browse the man pages, using the http method. The
option -l (for &rsquo;lynxcgi&rsquo;) selects the former
behaviour. With it, the default cgipath is
/usr/lib.

In general, a
cgi script can be called by

/?

and the
environment variables PATH_INFO and QUERY_STRING will be set
to  and , respectively. Since
lynxcgi does not handle the PATH_INFO part, we generate
hyperlinks with &rsquo;?&rsquo; as a separator by default.
The option -p (for &rsquo;path&rsquo;) selects
&rsquo;/&rsquo; as a separator, while the option -q (for
&rsquo;query&rsquo;) selects &rsquo;?&rsquo; as a
separator.

The option -H
host will specify the host to use (instead of
localhost). A cgi script could use

man2html -H
$SERVER_NAME

if the variable
SERVER_NAME is set. This would allow your machine to act as
a server and export man pages.

BUGS

There are many
heuristics. The output will not always be perfect. The
lynxcgi method will not work if lynx was compiled without
selecting support for it. There may be problems with
security.
