NAME

inn.conf -
configuration data for InterNetNews programs

DESCRIPTION

The file
/etc/news/inn.conf is used to determine various
parameters. Blank lines and lines starting with a number
sign (&rsquo;&rsquo;#&rsquo;&rsquo;) are ignored. All other
lines specify parameters that may be read, and should be of
the following form:

name : [optional whitespace]
value

Everything after the whitespace
and up to the end of the line is taken as the value;
multi-word values should not be put in quotes. The case of
names is significant &mdash; server is not the same
as Server or SERVER.

Some parameters
specified in the file may be overridden by environment
variables, and some file parameters may be used to mask real
data, such as when hiding a cluster of hosts behind a single
electronic mail hostname. The current set of parameters is
as follows: 
fromhost

This is the name of the host to
use when building the From header line. The default is the
fully-qualified domain name of the local host. The value of
the FROMHOST environment variable, if it exists, overrides
this.

moderatormailer

This names the default machine
that contains forwarding aliases for all moderated groups.
It is only used if the moderators(5) file
doesn&rsquo;t exist, or if the group is not matched by that
file. The value is interpreted as a pattern match; see
moderators(5).

organization

This specifies what to put in
the Organization header if it is blank. The value of the
ORGANIZATION environment variable, if it exists, overrides
this.

pathhost

This specifies how to name the
local site when building the Path header line. The default
is the fully-qualified domain name of the local host.

server

This specifies the name of the NNTP server to which an
article should be posted. The value of the NNTPSERVER
environment variable, if it exists, overrides this.

domain

This should be the domain name of the local host. It
should not have a leading period, and it should not be a
full host address. It is used only if the GetFQDN
routine in libinn(3) cannot get the fully-qualified
domain name by using either the gethostname(2) or
gethostbyname(3) calls. The check is very simple; if
either routine returns a name with a period in it, then it
is assumed to have the full domain name.

nntpport

This is the TCP port INN is
accepting connections on. This can be changed, for example
if you want to run in.nnrpd from inetd on port 119. The
default value is &rsquo;&rsquo;119.&rsquo;&rsquo;

useactived

When this parameter is enabled
(&rsquo;&rsquo;yes&rsquo;&rsquo;), nnrpd will try
using the actived program. The default value is
&rsquo;&rsquo;no&rsquo;&rsquo;.

The
inewsport parameter is only used by inews when
posting an article.

Three
parameters are used only by nnrpd when accepting
postings from clients: 
mime-version

If this parameter is present,
then nnrpd will add the necessary MIME (Multipurpose
Internet Mail Extensions) headers to all any articles that
do not have a Mime-Version header. This parameter specifies
the MIME version, and should normally be
&rsquo;&rsquo;1.0&rsquo;&rsquo;.

mime-contenttype

If MIME headers are being
added, this parameter specifies the value of the
Content-Type header. The default value is
&rsquo;&rsquo;text/plain;
charset=US-ASCII.&rsquo;&rsquo;

mime-encoding

If MIME headers are being
added, this parameter specifies the value of the
Content-Transfer-Encoding header. The default value is
&rsquo;&rsquo;7bit.&rsquo;&rsquo;

Note that this
file can be identical on all machines in an
organization.

EXAMPLE

fromhost:
foo.com

moderatormailer:

%s [AT] uunet.net

organization:

Foo, Incorporated

#pathhost -- use FQDN.

server:

news.foo.com

domain: foo.com

This file is
intended to be fairly static; any changes made to it are
typically not reflected until a program restarts.
