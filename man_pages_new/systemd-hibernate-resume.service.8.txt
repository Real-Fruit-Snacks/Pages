NAME

systemd-hibernate-resume.service,
systemd-hibernate-clear.service, systemd-hibernate-resume -
Resume from hibernation

SYNOPSIS

systemd-hibernate-resume.service

systemd-hibernate-clear.service

/usr/lib/systemd/systemd-hibernate-resume

DESCRIPTION

systemd-hibernate-resume.service
initiates the resume from hibernation.

systemd-hibernate-resume
only supports the in-kernel hibernation implementation, see
Swap suspend
[1]
. Internally, it works by writing the
major:minor of selected device node to /sys/power/resume,
along with the offset in memory pages
(/sys/power/resume_offset) if supported.

The
resume device node is either passed directly through
arguments, or automatically acquired from kernel command
line options and/or HibernateLocation EFI variable.
The latter will normally be cleared by
systemd-hibernate-resume.service on resumption. If a stale
variable is detected, it would be cleared by
systemd-hibernate-clear.service.

Failing
to initiate a resume is not an error condition. It may mean
that there was no resume image (e. g. if the system has been
simply powered off and not hibernated). In such cases, the
boot is ordinarily continued.
