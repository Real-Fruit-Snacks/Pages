CHOWN(8) BSD System Manager&rsquo;s Manual CHOWN(8)

NAME

chown &mdash; change file
owner and group

SYNOPSIS

chown
[&minus;fhv] [

&minus;R
[&minus;H | &minus;L | &minus;P]
] owner[:group] file ...

chown
[&minus;fhv] [

&minus;R
[&minus;H | &minus;L | &minus;P]
] :group file ...

DESCRIPTION

The chown utility changes
the user ID and/or the group ID of the specified files.
Symbolic links named by arguments are silently left
unchanged unless &minus;h is used.

The options are
as follows:

&minus;H

If the
&minus;R option is specified, symbolic links on the
command line are followed. (Symbolic links encountered in
the tree traversal are not followed.)

&minus;L

If the
&minus;R option is specified, all symbolic links are
followed.

&minus;P

If the
&minus;R option is specified, no symbolic links are
followed. This is the default.

&minus;R

Change the user
ID and/or the group ID for the file hierarchies rooted in
the files instead of just the files themselves.

&minus;f

Don&rsquo;t
report any failure to change file owner or group, nor modify
the exit status to reflect such failures.

&minus;h

If the file is
a symbolic link, change the user ID and/or the group ID of
the link itself.

&minus;v

Cause
chown to be verbose, showing files as the owner is
modified.

The
&minus;H, &minus;L and &minus;P options
are ignored unless the &minus;R option is specified.
In addition, these options override each other and the
command&rsquo;s actions are determined by the last one
specified.

The owner
and group operands are both optional, however, one
must be specified. If the group operand is specified,
it must be preceded by a colon
(&rsquo;&rsquo;:&rsquo;&rsquo;) character.

The owner
may be either a numeric user ID or a user name. If a user
name is also a numeric user ID, the operand is used as a
user name. The group may be either a numeric group ID
or a group name. If a group name is also a numeric group ID,
the operand is used as a group name.

The ownership of
a file may only be altered by a super-user for obvious
security reasons.

DIAGNOSTICS

The chown utility
exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error
occurs.

COMPATIBILITY

Previous versions of the
chown utility used the dot
(&rsquo;&rsquo;.&rsquo;&rsquo;) character to distinguish the
group name. This has been changed to be a colon
(&rsquo;&rsquo;:&rsquo;&rsquo;) character so that user and
group names may contain the dot character.

On previous
versions of this system, symbolic links did not have
owners.

The
&minus;v option is non-standard and its use in
scripts is not recommended.

STANDARDS

The chown utility is
expected to be IEEE Std 1003.2
(&rsquo;&rsquo;POSIX.2&rsquo;&rsquo;) compliant.

HISTORY

A chown utility appeared
in Version 1 AT&T UNIX.
