NAME

btrfs-select-super
- overwrite primary superblock with a backup copy

SYNOPSIS

btrfs-select-super
-s number 

DESCRIPTION

Destructively
overwrite all copies of the superblock with a specified
copy. This helps in certain cases, for example when write
barriers were disabled during a power failure and not all
superblocks were written, or if the primary superblock is
damaged, e.g. accidentally overwritten.

The filesystem
specified by device must not be mounted.

NOTE:

Prior to overwriting the
primary superblock, please make sure that the backup copies
are valid!

To dump a
superblock use the btrfs inspect-internal dump-super
command.

Then run the
check (in the non-repair mode) using the command btrfs
check -s where -s specifies the superblock copy
to use.

Superblock
copies exist in the following offsets on the device:

&bull;

primary: 64KiB (65536)

&bull;

1st copy: 64MiB (67108864)

&bull;

2nd copy: 256GiB (274877906944)

A superblock
size is 4KiB (4096).

OPTIONS

-s|--super

use Nth superblock copy, valid
values are 0 1 or 2 if the respective superblock offset is
within the device size
