leap-seconds file manager/updater

SYNOPSIS

ntpleapfetch

[-46] [-c command] [-e expiry] [-f
config] [-F] [-h] 
[-i interval] [-l] [L] [-p {4|6}] [-P
logfacility] [-q] 
[-r retries] [-s source-url] [-t path]
[-v] [-z path] 
[-Z] [leapfile] [-V | --version] [filename]

DESCRIPTION

ntpleapfetch
will validate the file currently on the local system and if
necessary, update leap second definition file.

Ordinarily, the
file is found using the "leapfile" directive in
ntp.conf(5). However, an alternate location can be
specified on the command line.

If the file
does not exist, is not valid, has expired, or is expiring
soon, a new copy will be downloaded. If the new copy
validates, it is installed and NTP is (optionally)
restarted.

If the current
file is acceptable, no download or restart occurs.

-c can also be
used to invoke another script to perform administrative
functions, e.g. to copy the file to other local systems.

This can be run
as a cron job. As the file is rarely updated, and leap
seconds are announced at least one month in advance (usually
longer), it need not be run more frequently than about once
every three weeks.

For
cron-friendly behavior, define CRONJOB=1 in the crontab.

OPTIONS

-4

Use only IPv4 addresses for DNS
name resolution. This option must not appear in combination
with -6.

-6

Use only IPv6 addresses for DNS
name resolution. This option must not appear in combination
with -4.

-c

Command to restart ntpd after
installing a new file. Without such a command, ntpd checks
the file daily.

-e
expiry

Refresh the leapfile this long
before it expires.

Specify how
long before expiration the file is to be refreshed. Units
are required, e.g. "-e 60 days". Note that larger
values imply more frequent refreshes.

-f
config

Location of the ntp.conf
file.

Specify
location of ntp.conf, which defaults to /etc/ntp.conf. It is
read to make sure the "leapfile" directive is
present and to determine the default path to the
leapfile.

-F

Force update even if current
file is OK and not close to expiring.

-i
interval

Number of minutes between
retries.

-h

Display inline help.

-l

Use syslog for output (Implied
if CRONJOB is set).

-L

Don&rsquo;t use syslog for
output

-p {4|6}

Prefer IPv4 or IPv6 (as
specified) addresses, but use either.

-P
logfacility

Specify the syslog facility for
logging.

-q

Only report errors to
stdout.

-r
retries

Number of retries.

-s
source-url

The URL of the master copy of
the leapseconds file.

-t
path

Name of temporary file used in
validation.

-v

Verbose output.

-z
path

Specify path for utilities.

-Z

Use system path only.

-V,
--version

Print the version string and
exit.

leapfile

An alternate location to
download the leapseconds file to.

EXIT STATUS

One of the
following exit values will be returned:

0
(EXIT_SUCCESS)

Successful program
execution.

1
(EXIT_FAILURE)

The operation failed or the
command syntax was not valid.

2

Internal error - restart
