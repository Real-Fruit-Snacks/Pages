NAME

ppmtosixel -
convert a PPM image to DEC sixel format

SYNOPSIS

ppmtosixel

[-raw]

[-margin]

[-7bit]

[ppmfile]

DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

ppmtosixel
reads a PPM image as input and produces sixel commands (SIX)
as output. The output is formatted for color printing (e.g.
for a DEC LJ250 color inkjet printer) or for color display
on DEC VT terminals and terminal emulators (VT240 and
beyond).

If RGB values
from the PPM file do not have maxval=100, ppmtosixel
rescales them to maxval 100. A printer control header and a
color assignment table begin the SIX file. Image data is in
a compressed format by default. A printer control footer
ends the image file.

OPTIONS

In addition to
the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most
notably -quiet, see
 Common Options ),
ppmtosixel recognizes the following command line
options:

-raw

If you specify this, each pixel will be explicitly
described in the image file. If -raw is not
specified, output will default to compressed format in which
identical adjacent pixels are replaced by "repeat
pixel" commands. A raw file is often an order of
magnitude larger than a compressed file and prints much
slower. 

-margin

If you don&rsquo;t specify
-margin, the image will start at the left margin (of
the window, paper, or whatever). If you do specify
-margin, a 1.5 inch left margin will offset the
image.

-7bit

If you don&rsquo;t specify -7bit, each control
code will be expressed as a single, 8-bit "C1"
character. If you do specify -7bit, each control code
will be expressed using two, 7-bit "C0"
characters. (See
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C0_and_C1_control_codes">C0
and C1 control codes for more information.) In other
words, -7bit produces more portable sixel files, and
its absence produces smaller sixel files.

This option was
new in Netpbm 11.04 (September 2023).

PRINTING

Generally,
sixel files must reach the printer unfiltered. Use the lpr
-x option or cat filename > /dev/tty0?.

LIMITATIONS

Upon rescaling,
truncation of the least significant bits of RGB values may
result in poor color conversion. If the original PPM maxval
was greater than 100, rescaling also reduces the image
depth. While the actual RGB values from the ppm file are
more or less retained, the color palette of the LJ250 may
not match the colors on your screen. This seems to be a
printer limitation.
