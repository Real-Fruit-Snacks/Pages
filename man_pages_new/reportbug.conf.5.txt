NAME

reportbug.conf
- The configuration file for reportbug

SYNOPSIS

/etc/reportbug.conf
- The configuration file for reportbug, a program designed
to report bugs in the Debian distribution

DESCRIPTION

This manual
page describes the layout of the reportbug and
querybts configuration file and the available
configuration options. The default location of the file is
/etc/reportbug.conf and the options may be overriding
in $HOME/.reportbugrc (which follows the same format
as reportbug.conf).

Please note
that any configuration file has to be a valid UTF-8
document, and not in a different locale; this is
particularly important in situations where localized
characters have to be used (like for realname).

FILE FORMAT

Configuration
options can be specified in the form

option-name
option-value

True/False
(boolean) options can be specified as

boolean-option

(if it&rsquo;s
present, it&rsquo;s a True).

Usually,
no-option will disable option if option
is boolean.

Options can be
specified in any order.

OPTIONS

The summary of
possible options (in alphabetical order) is as follows:

bts

The bug tracking system to use, see reportbug
--bts=help for a list of currently supported BTSes.

cc
(boolean)

Whether the reporter should be
Cc:ed on the bug report.

check-available
(boolean)

Whether
packages.debian.org should be queried for newer
releases of the package. In advanced and
expert mode, incoming.debian.org and
http://ftp-master.debian.org/new.html are also
checked.

compress
(boolean)

Whether modified configuration
files included in the bug report should be stripped
down.

config-files
(boolean)

Whether modified configuration
files should be included with the bug report.

editor

The editor to use to edit the bug report. Example:

editor
"emacs -nw"

email

Default From address of
the bug email (override with environment variables, see
reportbug(1)). Example:

email
"humberto [AT] example.com"

envelopefrom

Specify the Envelope From mail
header (also known as Return-path); by default it&rsquo;s
the From address but it can be selected a different one in
case the MTA doesn&rsquo;t canonicalize local users to
public addresses.

list-cc-me
(boolean)

Send a carbon copy of the
report to your automatically detected email address after a
report number is assigned, like the --list-cc-me
option.

mbox_reader_cmd

Specify a command to open the
bug reports mbox file. You can use %s to substitute
the mbox file to be used, and %% to insert a literal
percent sign. If no %s is specified, the mbox file
name is supplied at the end of the argument list.
Example:

mbox_reader_cmd
"mutt -f %s"

header

Additional headers to add to the bug email. Like:

header
"X-Debbugs-CC: debian-qa [AT] lists.org"

header "X-Silly-Header: I haven&rsquo;t edited
my /etc/reportbug.conf" 
header "X-Debbugs-No-Ack: please" # to
suppress acknowledgments

Note that
setting additional headers may not work reliably if the bug
email is passed to an external MUA for submission.

query the BTS (override with environment variables, see
reportbug(1)). Example:

http_proxy
http://proxy.example.com:3128/

&rsquo;mutt -H&rsquo;

mutt

no-check-uid
(boolean)

Disables checking whether the
UIDs are outside admin range (root is still

debconf-show output to the bug report.

no-query-source
(boolean)

Disables querying the source
packages for bugs.
