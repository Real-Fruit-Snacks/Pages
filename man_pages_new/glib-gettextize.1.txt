SYNOPSIS

glib-gettextize

DESCRIPTION

glib-gettextize
helps to prepare a source package for being
internationalized through gettext. It is a variant of
the gettextize that ships with gettext.

glib-gettextize
differs from gettextize in that it doesn&rsquo;t
create an intl/ subdirectory and doesn&rsquo;t modify
po/ChangeLog (note that newer versions of
gettextize behave like this when called with the
--no-changelog option).
