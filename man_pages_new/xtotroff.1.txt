Description

xtotroff
uses font-map to create groff(1) font
description files from X11 fonts. Each line in
font-map consists of a series of lines of paired
groff font names and X font names as X Logical Font
Description (XLFD) patterns, with the pair members separated
by spaces and/or tabs. For example, an input font-map
file consisting of the line

TB
-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--*-*-*-*-p-*-iso8859-1

maps the XLFD on the right to
the groff font name TB, conventionally
&ldquo;Times bold&rdquo;.

xtotroff
opens a connection to the running X server to query its font
catalog, and aborts if it cannot. If necessary, the
wildcards in the XLFD patterns are populated with the
arguments to the -r and -s options. If a font
name is still ambiguous, xtotroff aborts. For each
successful mapping, xtotroff creates a groff
font description file in the current working directory (or
that specified by the -d option) named for each
groff font, and reports the mapping to the standard
output stream.

Options

--help
displays a usage message, while -v and
--version show version information; all exit
afterward. 
-d destination-directory

Write font descriptions to
destination-directory rather than the current working
directory.

-r resolution

Set the resolution for all font
patterns in font-map. The value is used for both the
horizontal and vertical motion quanta. If not specified, a
resolution of 75dpi is assumed.

-s type-size

Set the type size in points for
all font patterns in font-map. If not specified, a
size of 10 points is assumed.

Files

/usr/share/groff/1.23.0/font/FontMap-X11

is the font mapping file used
to produce the pre-generated font description files,
supplied with groff, of X11 core fonts corresponding
to the 13 base Type 1 fonts for PostScript level 1.

Bugs

The only
supported font encodings are &ldquo;iso8859-1&rdquo; and
&ldquo;adobe- fontspecific&rdquo;.
