NAME

gprofng - The
next generation GNU application profiling tool

SYNOPSIS

gprofng
[option(s)] action [qualifier]
[option(s)] target [options]

DESCRIPTION

This is the
driver for the gprofng tools suite to gather and analyze
performance data.

The driver
executes the action specified. An example of an
action is collect to collect performance data.
Depending on the action, a qualifier may be needed to
further define the command. The last item is the
target that the command applies to.

There are three
places where options are supported. The driver supports
options. These can be found below. The action,
possibly in combination with the qualifier also
supports options. A description of these can be found in the
man page for the command. Any options needed to execute the
target command should follow the target name.

For example, to
collect performance data for an application called
a.out and store the results in experiment directory
mydata.er, the following command may be used:

$ gprofng
collect app -o mydata.er a.out -t 2

In this
example, the action is collect, the qualifier is
app, the single argument to the command is "-o
mydata.er" and the target is a.out. The target
command is invoked with the -t 2 option.

If gprofng is
executed without any additional option, action, or target, a
usage overview is printed.

OPTIONS

--version

Print the version number and
exit.

--help

Print usage information and
exit.

ENVIRONMENT

The following
environment variables are supported: 
GPROFNG_MAX_CALL_STACK_DEPTH

Set the depth of the call stack
(default is 256).

GPROFNG_USE_JAVA_OPTIONS

May be set when profiling a
C/C++ application that uses dlopen() to execute Java
code.

GPROFNG_ALLOW_CORE_DUMP

Set this variable to allow a
core file to be generated; otherwise an error report is
created on /tmp.

GPROFNG_ARCHIVE

Use this variable to define the
settings for automatic archiving upon experiment recording
completion.

GPROFNG_ARCHIVE_COMMON_DIR

Set this variable to the
location of the common archive.

GPROFNG_JAVA_MAX_CALL_STACK_DEPTH

Set the depth of the Java call
stack; the default is 256; set to 0 to disable capturing of
call stacks.

GPROFNG_JAVA_NATIVE_MAX_CALL_STACK_DEPTH

Set the depth of the Java
native call stack; the default is 256; set to 0 to disable
capturing of call stacks (JNI and assembly call stacks are
not captured).

GPROFNG_SYSCONFDIR

Set the path to the
gprofng.rc configuration file. By default, this file
is placed in the etc subdirectory of the binutils
installation directory. In case an RPM has been used for the
installation, this file is in directory /etc.

When building
and installing from the source, the user can set the path to
this configuration file to a non-default location. If this
is the case, the user may set the
"GPROFNG_SYSCONFDIR" environment variable to point
to this location.

Otherwise, the
gp-display-text, gp-display-src, and
gp-archive tools cannot find this file.

NOTES

The gprofng
driver supports the following commands.

Collect
performance data: 
"gprofng collect app"

Collect application performance
data.

Display the
performance results: 
"gprofng display text"

Display the performance data in
ASCII format.

"gprofng display
html"

Generate an HTML file from one
or more experiments.

"gprofng display
gui"

Start the GUI. Note that this
tool is not available by default and needs to be installed
seperately.

Miscellaneous
commands: 
"gprofng display src"

Display source or disassembly
with compiler annotations.

"gprofng archive"

Include binaries and source
code in an experiment directory.

It is also
possible to invoke the lower level commands directly, but
since these are subject to change, in particular the
options, we recommend to use the driver.

SEE ALSO

gp-archive(1),
gp-collect-app(1), gp-display-gui(1),
gp-display-html(1), gp-display-src(1),
gp-display-text(1)

Each gprofng
command also supports the --help option. This lists
the options and a short description for each option.

For example
this displays the options supported on the gprofng
collect app command:

$ gprofng
collect app --help

The user guide
for gprofng is maintained as a Texinfo manual. If the
info and gprofng programs are correctly
installed, the command info gprofng should give
access to this document.
