NAME

vmware&minus;user
&minus; GUI tool

SYNOPSIS

vmware&minus;user

DESCRIPTION

vmware&minus;user
is a relatively small Gtk application that should run for
the duration of an interactive X11 session. It has no
dependencies on X11 service daemons (e.g., messaging buses),
and so it may be launched at any time during or after
session startup.

It&rsquo;s a
hidden window application and handles tools features which
we want active all the time, but don&rsquo;t want to impose
a visable window on the user.

Without a
running vmware&minus;user process, interactive X11 sessions
will lack GUI features such as drag&minus;and&minus;drop
(DnD), file and text copy/paste, dynamic display resizing,
and Unity.

vmware&minus;user
depends on a mounted vmblock(9) filesystem for proper
host to guest DnD operations.

Drag&minus;and&minus;drop
operations depend on a setuid wrapper,
vmware&minus;user&minus;suid&minus;wrapper(8).

A recent change
to the Open VM Tools adjusted the nature of the relationship
between the VMware Tools service
(vmware&minus;guestd(8)) and the VMware user process
(vmware&minus;user). The two programs have been completely
decoupled, and as such vmware&minus;guestd(8) no
longer attempts to automatically start and stop
vmware&minus;user processes on users&rsquo; behalf.

Modern display
managers implementing the XDG autostart spec support
launching applications at session startup via placing a
&rsquo;vmware&minus;user.desktop&rsquo; file in a
well&minus;known location (/etc/xdg/autostart).

OPTIONS
