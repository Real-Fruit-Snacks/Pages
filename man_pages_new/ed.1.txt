NAME

ed -
line-oriented text editor

SYNOPSIS

ed
[options] [[+line] file]

DESCRIPTION

GNU ed is a
line-oriented text editor. It is used to create, display,
modify and otherwise manipulate text files, both
interactively and via shell scripts. A restricted version of
ed, red, can only edit files in the current directory and
cannot execute shell commands. Ed is the
&rsquo;standard&rsquo; text editor in the sense that it is
the original editor for Unix, and thus widely available. For
most purposes, however, it is superseded by full-screen
editors such as GNU Emacs or GNU Moe.

The file name
may be preceded by &rsquo;+line&rsquo;, &rsquo;+/RE&rsquo;,
or &rsquo;+?RE&rsquo; to set the current line to the line
number specified or to the first or last line matching the
regular expression &rsquo;RE&rsquo;.

Start edit by
reading in &rsquo;file&rsquo; if given. If
&rsquo;file&rsquo; begins with a &rsquo;!&rsquo;, read
output of shell command.

Exit status: 0
for a normal exit, 1 for environmental problems (invalid
command-line options, memory exhausted, command failed,
etc), 2 for problems with the input file (file not found,
buffer modified, I/O errors), 3 for an internal consistency
error (e.g., bug) which caused ed to panic.
