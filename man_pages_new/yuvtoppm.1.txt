NAME

yuvtoppm -
convert Abekas YUV bytes to PPM

SYNOPSIS

yuvtoppm

width
height [imagedata]

DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

yuvtoppm
reads raw Abekas YUV bytes as input and produces a PPM image
as output. The input file is just YUV bytes. You have to
specify the width and height on the command line, since the
program obviously can&rsquo;t get them from the file.
yuvotppm assumes the maxval of the input is 255.

The ppmtoyuv
manual(1) tells a little about the Abekas YUV
format.

OPTIONS

There are no
command line options defined specifically for
yuvtoppm, but it recognizes the options common to all
programs based on libnetpbm (See
 Common Options
.)
