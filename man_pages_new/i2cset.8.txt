NAME

i2cset - set
I2C registers

SYNOPSIS

i2cset
[-f] [-y] [-m mask] [-r]
[-a] i2cbus chip-address data-address
[value] ... [mode] 
i2cset -V

DESCRIPTION

i2cset is a
small helper program to set registers visible through the
I2C bus.

OPTIONS

-V

Display the version and
exit. 

-f

Force access to the device even if it is already busy.
By default, i2cset will refuse to access a device which is
already under the control of a kernel driver. Using this
flag is dangerous, it can seriously confuse the kernel
driver in question. It can also cause i2cset to silently
write to the wrong register. So use at your own risk and
only if you know what you&rsquo;re doing.

-y

Disable interactive mode. By default, i2cset will wait
for a confirmation from the user before messing with the I2C
bus. When this flag is used, it will perform the operation
directly. This is mainly meant to be used in scripts.

-m mask

The mask parameter, if
specified, describes which bits of value will be
actually written to data-address. Bits set to 1 in
the mask are taken from value, while bits set to 0
will be read from data-address and thus preserved by
the operation. Please note that this parameter assumes that
the read and write operations for the specified mode are
symmetrical for the device you are accessing. This may or
may not be the case, as neither I2C nor SMBus guarantees
this.

-r

Read back the value right after writing it, and compare
the result with the value written. This used to be the
default behavior. The same limitations apply as those of
option -m.

-a

Allow using addresses between 0x00 - 0x07 and 0x78 -
0x7f. Not recommended.

There are three
required options to i2cset. i2cbus indicates the
number or name of the I2C bus to be scanned. This number
should correspond to one of the busses listed by
i2cdetect -l. chip-address specifies the
address of the chip on that bus, and is an integer between
0x08 and 0x77. data-address specifies the address on
that chip to write to, and is an integer between 0x00 and
0xFF.

The
value parameter, if specified, is the value to write
to that location on the chip. If this parameter is omitted,
then a short write is issued. For most chips, it simply sets
an internal pointer to the target location, but
doesn&rsquo;t actually write to that location. For a few
chips though, in particular simple ones with a single
register, this short write is an actual write. If the mode
parameter is s or i, multiple values can be
specified.

The mode
parameter, if specified, is one of the letters b,
w, s, or i, corresponding to a write
size of a single byte, a 16-bit word, a SMBus block write,
or an I2C block write, respectively. For SMBus and I2C block
writes, the write size is determined by the number of
value parameters. Except for I2C block writes, a
p can also be appended to the mode parameter
to enable PEC. If the mode parameter is omitted,
i2cset defaults to byte mode without PEC. The value
provided must be within range for the specified data type
(0x00-0xFF for byte and block writes, 0x0000-0xFFFF for
words). Another possible mode is c, which
doesn&rsquo;t write any value (so-called short write). You
usually don&rsquo;t have to specify this mode, as it is the
default when no value is provided, unless you also want to
enable PEC.

WARNING

i2cset can be
extremely dangerous if used improperly. It can confuse your
I2C bus, cause data loss, or have more serious side effects.
Writing to a serial EEPROM on a memory DIMM (chip addresses
between 0x50 and 0x57) may DESTROY your memory, leaving your
system unbootable! Be extremely careful using this
program.

EXAMPLES

Write value
0x42 to 8-bit register 0x11 of the I2C device at 7-bit
address 0x2d on bus 1 (i2c-1), after user confirmation:

# i2cset 1 0x2d 0x11 0x42

Immediately
clear the 3 least significant bits of 8-bit register 0x11 of
the I2C device at 7-bit address 0x2d on bus 1 (i2c-1) (no
user confirmation):

# i2cset -y -m 0x07 1 0x2d 0x11
0x00

Write value
0x5000 to 16-bit register 0x02 of the I2C device at 7-bit
address 0x48 on bus 1 (i2c-1), after user confirmation:

# i2cset 1 0x48 0x02 0x5000
w
