NAME

format &minus;
disk partitioning and maintenance utility

SYNOPSIS

format
[-f command-file]
[-l log-file]
[-x data-file]
[-d disk-name]
[-t disk-type]
[-p partition-name] [-s]
[-m] [-M] [-e] [disk-list]

DESCRIPTION

format
enables you to format, label, repair and analyze disks on
your system. Unlike previous disk maintenance programs,
format runs under SunOS. Because there are
limitations to what can be done to the system disk while the
system is running, format is also supported within
the memory-resident system environment. For most
applications, however, running format under SunOS is
the more convenient approach.

format
first uses the disk list defined in data-file if the
-x option is used. format then checks for the
FORMAT_PATH environment variable, a colon-separated
list of filenames and/or directories. In the case of a
directory, format searches for a file named
format.dat in that directory; a filename should be an
absolute pathname, and is used without change. format
adds all disk and partition definitions in each specified
file to the working set. Multiple identical definitions are
silently ignored. If FORMAT_PATH is not set, the path
defaults to /etc/format.dat.

disk-list
is a list of disks in the form c?t?d? or
/dev/rdsk/c?t?d?s?. With the latter form, shell
wildcard specifications are supported. For example,
specifying /dev/rdsk/c2* causes format to work
on all drives connected to controller c2 only. If no
disk-list is specified, format lists all the
disks present in the system that can be administered by
format.

Removable media
devices are listed only when users execute format in
expert mode (option -e). This feature is provided for
backward compatibility. Use rmformat(1) for
rewritable removable media devices.

OPTIONS

The following
options are supported: 
-d disk-name

Specify which disk should be
made current upon entry into the program. The disk is
specified by its logical name (for instance, -d
c0t1d0). This can also be accomplished by specifying a
single disk in the disk list.

-e

Enable SCSI expert menu. Note this option is not
recommended for casual use.

-f
command-file

Take command input from
command-file rather than the standard input. The file
must contain commands that appear just as they would if they
had been entered from the keyboard. With this option,
format does not issue continue? prompts; there
is no need to specify y(es) or n(o) answers in the
command-file. In non-interactive mode, format
does not initially expect the input of a disk selection
number. The user must specify the current working disk with
the -d disk-name option when format is
invoked, or specify disk and the disk selection
number in the command-file.

-l log-file

Log a transcript of the
format session to the indicated log-file,
including the standard input, the standard output and the
standard error.

-m

Enable extended messages. Provides more detailed
information in the event of an error.

-M

Enable extended and diagnostic messages. Provides
extensive information on the state of a SCSI
device&rsquo;s mode pages, during formatting.

-p
partition-name

Specify the partition table for
the disk which is current upon entry into the program. The
table is specified by its name as defined in the data file.
This option can be used only if a disk is being made
current, and its type is either specified or available from
the disk label.

-s

Silent. Suppress all of the standard output. Error
messages are still displayed. This is generally used in
conjunction with the -f option.

-t disk-type

Specify the type of disk which
is current upon entry into the program. A disk&rsquo;s type
is specified by name in the data file. This option can only
be used if a disk is being made current as described
above.

-x data-file

Use the list of disks contained
in data-file.

USAGE

When you invoke
format with no options or with the -e, -l,
-m, -M, or -s options, the program
displays a numbered list of available disks and prompts you
to specify a disk by list number. If the machine has more
than 10 disks, press Space to see the next screenful of
disks.

You can specify
a disk by list number even if the disk is not displayed in
the current screenful. For example, if the current screen
shows disks 11-20, you can enter 25 to specify the
twenty-fifth disk on the list. If you enter a number for a
disk that is not currently displayed, format prompts
you to verify your selection. If you enter a number from the
displayed list, format silently accepts your
selection.

After you
specify a disk, format displays its main menu. This
menu enables you to perform the following tasks: 
analyze

Run read, write, and compare
tests.

backup

Search for backup labels.

cache

Enable, disable, and query the state of the write cache
and read cache. This menu item only appears when
format is invoked with the -e option, and is
only supported on SCSI devices..

current

Display the device name, the
disk geometry, and the pathname to the disk device.

defect

Retrieve and print defect
lists. This option is supported only on SCSI devices.
IDE disks perform automatic defect management. Upon
using the defect option on an IDE disk, you
receive the message:

Controller does not support defect management
or disk supports automatic defect management.

disk

Choose the disk that will be used in subsequent
operations (known as the current disk.)

fdisk

Run the fdisk(1M) program to create a
fdisk partition for Solaris software (IA based
systems only).

format

Format and verify the current
disk. This option is supported only on SCSI devices.
IDE disks are pre-formatted by the manufacturer. Upon
using the format option on an IDE disk, you
receive the message:

Cannot format this drive. Please use your
manufacturer-supplied formatting utility.

inquiry

Display the vendor, product
name, and revision level of the current drive.

label

Write a new label to the current disk.

partition

Create and modify slices.

quit

Exit the format menu.

repair

Repair a specific block on the
disk.

save

Save new disk and slice information.

type

Select (define) a disk type.

verify

Read and display labels. Print
information such as the number of cylinders, alternate
cylinders, heads, sectors, and the partition table.

volname

Label the disk with a new eight
character volume name.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

FORMAT_PATH

a colon-separated list of
filenames and/or directories of disk and partition
definitions. If a directory is specified, format
searches for the file format.dat in that
directory.

FILES

/etc/format.dat

default data file

WARNINGS

When the
format function is selected to format the Maxtor
207MB disk, the following message displays:

Mode sense
page(4) reports rpm value as 0, adjusting it to 3600

This is a drive
bug that may also occur with older third party drives. The
above message is not an error; the drive will still function
correctly.

Cylinder 0
contains the partition table (disk label), which can be
overwritten if used in a raw disk partition by third party
software.

NOTES

format
provides a help facility you can use whenever format is
expecting input. You can request help about what information
is expected by simply entering a question mark (?)
and format prints a brief description of what type of
input is needed. If you enter a ? at the menu prompt,
a list of available commands is displayed.

For SCSI
disks, formatting is done with both Primary and Grown
defects list by default. However, if only Primary list is
extracted in defect menu before formatting, formatting will
be done with Primary list only.

Changing the
state of the caches is only supported on SCSI
devices, and not all SCSI devices support changing or
saving the state of the caches.
