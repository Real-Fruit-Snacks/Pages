OPTIONS

--help

Print a brief help message and
exits. 

-d, --debug

Enables debugging, outpus
additional information whilst processing requests.

-h,
--host=host

Specifies the host to connect
to. Must be specified and must be IP-resolvable.

-m,
--ehlo=machine

Specified the machine name to
use as the EHLO value. Defaults to the
fully-qualified name of the host running the command.

-r,
--rcptto=recipient

Specifies the recipient of
message. This is used as the RCPT TO value.

-v, --vrfy

Uses the recipient
parameter for the value in a VRFY request. This
disables the sending of an email.

-e, --expn

Uses the recipient
parameter for the value in an EXPN request. This
disables the sending of an email.

-f,
--mailfrom=from_address

Specified the value to use in
the MAIL FROM command. Defaults to the current
username at the FQDN of the machine -m unless the
-B option is used.

-u,
--from822=from_user

Specified the value to use in
the message headers. Defaults to the -f
from_address value unless the -B option is
used.

-B, --bounce

Replace the --mailfrom
from_address with \> and the
--from833 from_user with
mailer-daemon@host where the host is the value of
--ehlo machine

-p,
--port=port

Specified the port to connect
to on the specified host. Defaults to port 25 unless
-S is given in which case it defaults to 465.

-S, --tls

Specifies that TLS be used
directly on the connection prior to any SMTP commands.
Changes the connection port to 465 unless it has been
explicitly provided. Disables any attempts at
STARTTLS.

-s, --nostarttls

Disables attempting STARTTLS if
offered. Disabled by use of -S.

--stricttls

Enables strict verification of
the TLS connection. Sets the underlying SSL option
SSL_verify_mode to 1/SSL_VERIFY_PEER rather than
0/SSL_VERIFY_NONE. Since the aim of this tool is to test the
SMTP protocol behaviour and not the TLS behaviour the
decision was made to default the SSL_verify_mode to
0/SSL_VERIFY_NONE.

--sslargs=argname=argvalue[,argname=argvalue...]

Allow full control over
underlying SSL options. Overrides --stricttls. See
the documentation for IO::Socket::SSL for further
details.

--sslargs
SSL_verifycn_name=certname.example.com

-b, --body

Generate a body for the message
being sent.

-O,
--include-options

Include details of options used
in the message body.

-H,
--include-headers

Include a copy of the generated
headers in the message body.

-w,
--wellknown=well-known-path

Provides the path value for a
WELLKNOWN command.

-W,
--output=output_file

Provides the output file where
the WELLKNOWN data should be stored.

DESCRIPTION

mailtest
is a simple utility for testing SMTP connections. It is
