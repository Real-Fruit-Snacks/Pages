NAME

pgmcrater -
create cratered terrain by fractal forgery

SYNOPSIS

pgmcrater

[-number
n]

[-height|-ysize
s]

[-width|-xsize
s]

[-gamma
g]

[-randomseed=integer]

All options can
be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix. You may use
two hyphens instead of one to designate an option. You may
use either white space or equals signs between an option
name and its value.

DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

pgmcrater
is obsolete. All it does now is invoke pamcrater,
pamshadedrelief, and pamtopnm. You should use
those programs in any new application, or if you are
modifying an old program or process that does not have to
work with a version of Netpbm before 10.68 (September 2014).
pgmcrater exists only for backward compatibility.

The combination
of the three programs mentioned above performs the same
function as traditional pgmcrater.

pgmcrater&rsquo;s
-number, -height, -width, and
-randomseed options are equivalent to the options of
the same name on pamcrater.

pgmcrater&rsquo;s
-gamma option is equivalent to the option of the same
name on pamshadedrelief.

pgmcrater&rsquo;s
-ysize option is identical to -height;
-xsize is identical to -width.

Note: The
former pgmcrater code was split into pamcrater
and pamshadedrelief. The reason for the split is that
having separate programs is more consistent with
Netpbm&rsquo;s building block philosophy. It is possible the
separate components can be used in other applications.
