NAME

gp-display-html
- Generate an HTML based directory structure to browse the
profiles

SYNOPSIS

gprofng
display html [option(s)] experiment(s)

DESCRIPTION

Process one or
more experiments to generate a directory containing the
index.html file that may be used to browse the
experiment data.

OPTIONS

--version

Print the version number and
exit.

--help

Print usage information and
exit.

--verbose

Enable verbose mode to show
diagnostic messages about the processing of the data. By
default verbose mode is disabled.

-d
[db-vol-size],
--debug[=db-vol-size]

Control the printing of run
time debug information to assist with the troubleshooting,
or further development of this tool.

The
db-vol-size parameter controls the output volume and
is one from the list s, S, m, M,
l, L, xl, or XL. If
db-vol-size is not set, a modest amount of
information is printed. This is equivalent to select
s, or S. The volume of data goes up as the
size increases. Note that currently l/L is equivalent
to xl/XL, but this is expected to change in future
updates. By default debug mode is disabled.

--highlight-percentage=value

Set a percentage value in the
interval [0,100] to select and color code source lines, as
well as instructions, that are within this percentage of the
maximum metric value(s). The default is 90 (%). A value of
zero disables this feature.

-o dirname,
--output=dirname

Use dirname as the
directory name to store the results in. In absence of this
option, the default name is display..html.
This directory is created in the current directory. The
number  is the first positive integer number
not in use in this naming scheme. An existing directory with
the same name is not overwritten. In case the directory
exists already, an error message is printed and the tool
terminates.

-O dirname,
--overwrite=dirname

Use dirname as the
directory name to store the results in. In absence of this
option, the default name is display..html.
This directory is created in the current directory. The
number  is the first positive integer number
not in use in this naming scheme. An existing directory with
the same name is silently overwritten.

-q, --quiet

Disable the display of all
warning, debug, verbose and any other messages. If enabled,
the settings for verbose and debug are accepted, but
ignored. With this option, there is no screen output, other
than errors. By default quiet mode is disabled.

--nowarnings

Disable the printing of warning
messages on stdout. By default warning messages are
printed.

NOTES

-

The options and values are case
sensitive. 

-

In this release, the option syntax has changed to be
more compliant with other tools and commands.

The options
that used to have an on or off value only, now
act as a switch. The option negates the default setting. For
example, by default, verbose mode is disabled. It is enabled
by using the --verbose option.

The long
options, those starting with "--", that require a
value, expect the "=" sign between the option and
the value.

While the
previous syntax and choices are accepted still, we strongly
recommend to change the usage of the options according to
the new syntax and values. At some point, these legacy
settings may no longer be accepted.

To assist with
the transition, a warning message is shown if the legacy
syntax, or value, or both, are used.

-

The -hp option is still
accepted, but it will be deprecated in a future release. Use
the --highlight-percentage option instead.

-

When setting a directory name for the HTML files to be
stored in, make sure that umask is set to the correct access
permissions. 

-

Regardless of the setting for the warning messages, if
there are warnings, they are accessible through the main
index.html page.

-

The tool tries to accumulate as many warnings and errors
as possible, before taking action. In this way, it is easier
to address multiple issues at once. As a result of this
approach, it may be that the messages do not show
immediately. In particular, warnings are shown towards the
end of the execution, but one or more errors will terminate
execution before the processing begins.
