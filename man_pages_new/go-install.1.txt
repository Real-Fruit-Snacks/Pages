NAME

go - tool for
managing Go source code

SYNOPSIS

go
install [build flags] [packages]

DESCRIPTION

Install
compiles and installs the packages named by the import
paths.

Executables are
installed in the directory named by the GOBIN environment
variable, which defaults to $GOPATH/bin or $HOME/go/bin if
the GOPATH environment variable is not set. Executables in
$GOROOT are installed in $GOROOT/bin or $GOTOOLDIR instead
of $GOBIN.

If the
arguments have version suffixes (like @latest or @v1.0.0),
"go install" builds packages in module-aware mode,
ignoring the go.mod file in the current directory or any
parent directory, if there is one. This is useful for
installing executables without affecting the dependencies of
the main module. To eliminate ambiguity about which module
versions are used in the build, the arguments must satisfy
the following constraints:

&bull;

Arguments must be package paths or package patterns
(with "..." wildcards). They must not be standard
packages (like fmt), meta-patterns (std, cmd, all), or
relative or absolute file paths.

&bull;

All arguments must have the same version suffix.
Different queries are not allowed, even if they refer to the
same version.

&bull;

All arguments must refer to packages in the same module
at the same version.

&bull;

Package path arguments must refer to main packages.
Pattern arguments will only match main packages.

&bull;

No module is considered the "main" module. If
the module containing packages named on the command line has
a go.mod file, it must not contain directives (replace and
exclude) that would cause it to be interpreted differently
than if it were the main module. The module must not require
a higher version of itself.

&bull;

Vendor directories are not used in any module. (Vendor
directories are not included in the module zip files
downloaded by &rsquo;go install&rsquo;.)

If the
arguments don&rsquo;t have version suffixes, "go
install" may run in module-aware mode or GOPATH mode,
depending on the GO111MODULE environment variable and the
presence of a go.mod file. See &rsquo;go help modules&rsquo;
for details. If module-aware mode is enabled, "go
install" runs in the context of the main module.

When
module-aware mode is disabled, other packages are installed
in the directory $GOPATH/pkg/$GOOS_$GOARCH. When
module-aware mode is enabled, other packages are built and
cached but not installed.

The -i flag
installs the dependencies of the named packages as well.

The -i flag is deprecated. Compiled packages are cached
automatically.

the build flags, see go-build(1). 
For more about specifying packages, see
go-packages(7).
