SYNOPSIS

podman

DESCRIPTION

changes on a container&rsquo;s filesystem. The container is

given.

The output is
prefixed with the following symbols:

OPTIONS

--format

Alter the output into a different format. The only valid
format for podman container diff is json.

--latest,
-l 
Instead of providing the container name or ID, use the last
created container. Note: the last started container can be
from other users of Podman on the host machine. (This option
is not available with the remote Podman client, including
Mac and Windows (excluding WSL2) machines)

$ podman
container diff --format json container1 container2

] 
}
