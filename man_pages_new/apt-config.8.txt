NAME

apt-config -
APT Configuration Query program

SYNOPSIS

apt-config
[--empty]
[--format '%f "%v";%n']
[-o=config_string]
[-c=config_file] {shell | dump |
{-v | --version} | {-h | --help}}

DESCRIPTION

apt-config
is an internal program used by various portions of the APT
suite to provide consistent configurability. It accesses the
main configuration file /etc/apt/apt.conf in a manner that
is easy to use for scripted applications.

Unless the
-h, or --help option is given, one of the
commands below must be present.

shell

shell is used to access the
configuration information from a shell script. It is given
pairs of arguments, the first being a shell variable and the
second the configuration value to query. As output it lists
shell assignment commands for each value present. In a shell
script it should be used as follows:

OPTS="-f"

RES=&rsquo;apt-config shell OPTS MyApp::options&rsquo; 
eval $RES

This will set the shell
environment variable $OPTS to the value of MyApp::options
with a default of -f.

The
configuration item may be postfixed with a /[fdbi]. f
returns file names, d returns directories, b returns true or
false and i returns an integer. Each of the returns is
normalized and verified internally.

dump

Just show the contents of the
configuration space.

OPTIONS

All command
line options may be set using the configuration file, the
descriptions indicate the configuration option to set. For
boolean options you can override the config file by using
something like -f-,--no-f, -f=no or
several other variations.

--empty

Include options which have an
empty value. This is the default, so use --no-empty to
remove them from the output.

--format
'%f "%v";%n'

Defines the output of each
config option. %t will be replaced with its individual name,
%f with its full hierarchical name and %v with its value.
Use uppercase letters and special characters in the value
will be encoded to ensure that it can e.g. be safely used in
a quoted-string as defined by RFC822. Additionally %n will
be replaced by a newline, and %N by a tab. A % can be
printed by using %%.

-h,
--help

Show a short usage summary.

-v,
--version

Show the program version.

--audit

Show audit (and notice)
messages. This overrides the quiet option, but only for
notice messages, not progress ones.

-c,
--config-file

Configuration File; Specify a
configuration file to use. The program will read the default
configuration file and then this configuration file. If
configuration settings need to be set before the default
configuration files are parsed specify a file with the
APT_CONFIG environment variable. See
apt.conf(5) for syntax information.

-o,
--option

Set a Configuration Option;
This will set an arbitrary configuration option. The syntax
is -o Foo::Bar=bar. -o and --option can
be used multiple times to set different options.

--no-color,
--color

Turn colors on or off. Colors
are on by default on supported terminals for apt(8)
and can also be disabled using the NO_COLOR or
APT_NO_COLOR environment variables, or further
configured by the APT::Color configuration option and
scope, see apt.conf(5) for information on that.
