NAME

pnmcomp
- replaced by pamcomp

DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

pnmcomp
was obsoleted by pamcomp(1), introduced with Netpbm
10.21 (March 2004). pamcomp is backward compatible
with pnmcomp, plus adds many additional functions.
Among this is the ability to process PAM images, including
those with transparency channels.

pnmcomp
remained in the Netpbm package until Netpbm 10.68 (September
2014) because of hopes that it had fewer bugs than
pamcomp because of its age. But now it would just be
clutter.

In Netpbm
before 10.21, use the manual for pamcomp with
pnmcomp. Features that are in pamcomp but not
pnmcomp are indicated by statements that they
didn&rsquo;t exist before 10.21.
