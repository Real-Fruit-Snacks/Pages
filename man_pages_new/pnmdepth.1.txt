NAME

pnmdepth -
replaced by pamdepth

DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

Starting with
Netpbm 10.32 (February 2006), pnmdepth is obsolete.
Use pamdepth(1) instead.

pamdepth
is backward compatible with pnmdepth. You can use the
pamdepth manual for pnmdepth as long as you
ignore features that were added after Netpbm 10.31.

For backward
compatibility, the name &rsquo;pnmdepth&rsquo; continues to
exist as an alias for &rsquo;pamdepth&rsquo;. But because of
a bug, that name doesn&rsquo;t work in Netpbm 10.32. You
have to fix the symbolic link.
