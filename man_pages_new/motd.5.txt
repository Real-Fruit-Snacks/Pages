NAME

motd - message
of the day

DESCRIPTION

The contents of
/etc/motd are displayed by pam_motd(8) after a
successful login but just before it executes the login
shell.

The
abbreviation "motd" stands for "message of
the day", and this file has been traditionally used for
exactly that (it requires much less disk space than mail to
all users).

On Debian
GNU/Linux, dynamic content configured at
/etc/pam.d/login is also displayed by
pam_exec.
