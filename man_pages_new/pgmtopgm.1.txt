NAME

pgmtopgm - copy
PGM image

SYNOPSIS

pgmtopgm

DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

pgmtopgm
simply copies a PGM image from Standard Input to Standard
Output. This may seem an unnecessary duplication of
cat, but remember that a PGM program can read a PBM
image as if it were PGM. So pgmtopgm can read either
a PBM or PGM image and produce a PGM image as output.

Even that is of
limited usefulness because of the fact that almost any
program to which you would feed the resulting PGM image
could also just take the original image directly. However,
sometimes you really need a true PGM image.

When you know
you have a PBM image and want a PGM image, pbmtopgm
is a more general way to do that conversion.

OPTIONS
