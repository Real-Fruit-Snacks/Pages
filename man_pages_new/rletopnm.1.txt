NAME

rletopnm -
convert a Utah Raster Tools RLE image file to a PNM image
file.

SYNOPSIS

rletopnm

[--alphaout={alpha-filename,-}]
[--headerdump|-h]

[--verbose|-v]

[rlefile|-]

All options may
be abbreviated to their minimum unique abbreviation and
options and arguments may be in any order.

DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

rletopnm
converts Utah Raster Toolkit RLE image files to PNM image
files. rletopnm handles four types of RLE files:
Grayscale (8 bit data, no color map), Pseudocolor (8 bit
data with a color map), Truecolor (24 bit data with color
map), and Directcolor (24 bit data, no color map).
rletopnm generates a PPM file for all these cases
except for the Grayscale file, for which rletopnm
generates a PGM file.

rlefile
is the RLE input file. If it is absent or -, the
input comes from Standard Input.

OPTIONS

In addition to
the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most
notably -quiet, see
 Common Options ),
rletopnm recognizes the following command line
options: 
--alphaout=alpha-filename

rletopnm creates a PGM
(portable graymap) file containing the transparency channel
values in the input image. If the input image doesn&rsquo;t
contain an transparency channel, the alpha-filename
file contains all zero (transparent) transparency values. If
you don&rsquo;t specify --alphaout, rletopnm
does not generate a transparency file, and if the input
image has a transparency channel, rletopnm simply
discards it.

If you specify
- as the filename, rletopnm writes the
transparency output to Standard Output and discards the
image.

See
pamcomp(1) for one way to use the transparency output
file.

--verbose

This option causes
rletopnm to operate in verbose mode. It prints
messages about what it&rsquo;s doing, including the contents
of the RLE image header, to Standard Error.

--headerdump

This option causes
rletopnm to operate in header dump mode. It prints
the contents of the RLE image header to Standard Error, but
does not produce any other output.

EXAMPLES

&bull;

While running in verbose mode,
convert lenna.rle to PPM format and store the resulting
image as lenna.ppm:

rletopnm
--verbose lenna.rle >lenna.ppm

&bull;

Dump the header information of
the RLE file called file.rle:

rletopnm
--headerdump file.rle

&bull;

Convert RLE file dart.rle to PPM
format as dart.ppm. Store the transparency channel of
dart.rle as dartalpha.pgm (if dart.rle doesn&rsquo;t have a
transparency channel, store a fully transparent transparency
mask as dartalpha.pgm):

rletopnm
--alphaout=dartalpha.pgm dart.rle >dart.ppm
