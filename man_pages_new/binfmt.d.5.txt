NAME

binfmt.d -
Configure additional binary formats for executables at
boot

SYNOPSIS

/etc/binfmt.d/*.conf

/run/binfmt.d/*.conf 
/usr/local/lib/binfmt.d/*.conf 
/usr/lib/binfmt.d/*.conf

DESCRIPTION

At boot,
systemd-binfmt.service(8) reads configuration files
from the above directories to register in the kernel
additional binary formats for executables.

CONFIGURATION FORMAT

Each file
contains a list of binfmt_misc kernel binary format rules.
Consult the kernel's Kernel Support
for miscellaneous Binary Formats (binfmt_misc)
[1]
documentation file for more
information on registration of additional binary formats and
how to write rules.

Empty
lines and lines beginning with ";" and
"#" are ignored. Note that this means you may not
use those symbols as the delimiter in binary format
rules.

CONFIGURATION DIRECTORIES AND PRECEDENCE

Configuration
files are read from directories in /etc/, /run/,
/usr/local/lib/, and /usr/lib/, in order of precedence, as
listed in the SYNOPSIS section above. Files must have the
".conf" extension. Files in /etc/ override files
with the same name in /run/, /usr/local/lib/, and /usr/lib/.
Files in /run/ override files with the same name under
/usr/.

All
configuration files are sorted by their filename in
lexicographic order, regardless of which of the directories
they reside in. If multiple files specify the same option,
the entry in the file with the lexicographically latest name
will take precedence. Thus, the configuration in a certain
file may either be replaced completely (by placing a file
with the same name in a directory with higher priority), or
individual settings might be changed (by specifying
additional settings in a file with a different name that is
ordered later).

Packages
should install their configuration files in /usr/lib/
(distribution packages) or /usr/local/lib/ (local installs)
[2] . Files in /etc/ are reserved for the
local administrator, who may use this logic to override the
configuration files installed by vendor packages.

It
is recommended to prefix all filenames with a two-digit
number and a dash to simplify the ordering. It is
recommended to use the range 10-40 for configuration files
in /usr/ and the range 60-90 for configuration files in
/etc/ and /run/, to make sure that local and transient
configuration files will always take priority over
configuration files shipped by the OS vendor.

If
the administrator wants to disable a configuration file
supplied by the vendor, the recommended way is to place a
symlink to /dev/null in the configuration directory in
/etc/, with the same filename as the vendor configuration
file. If the vendor configuration file is included in the
initrd image, the image has to be regenerated.

note that those configuration files must be available at all
times. If /usr/local/ is a separate partition, it may not be
available during early boot, and must not be used for
configuration.
