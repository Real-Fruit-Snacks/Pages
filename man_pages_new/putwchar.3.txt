NAME

putwchar -
write a wide character to standard output

SYNOPSIS

#include

wint_t
putwchar(wchar_t wc);

DESCRIPTION

The
putwchar() function is the wide-character equivalent
of the putchar(3) function. It writes the wide
character wc to stdout. If
ferror(stdout) becomes true, it returns WEOF.
If a wide character conversion error occurs, it sets
errno to EILSEQ and returns WEOF.
Otherwise, it returns wc.

For a
nonlocking counterpart, see unlocked_stdio(3).

RETURN VALUE

The
putwchar() function returns wc if no error
occurred, or WEOF to indicate an error.

ATTRIBUTES

For an
explanation of the terms used in this section, see
attributes(7).

CONFORMING TO

POSIX.1-2001,
POSIX.1-2008, C99.

NOTES

The behavior of
putwchar() depends on the LC_CTYPE category of
the current locale.

It is
reasonable to expect that putwchar() will actually
write the multibyte sequence corresponding to the wide
character wc.
