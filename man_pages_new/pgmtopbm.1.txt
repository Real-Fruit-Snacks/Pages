DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

This program is
almost entirely obsolete since Netpbm 10.23 (July 2004). Use
pamditherbw(1) to do what this program used to
do.

pgmtopbm
never was the simple converter it appeared to be. It was a
dithering program. Unfortunately, it didn&rsquo;t do the
dithering properly because it treated the PGM input samples
as if they were directly proportional to light intensity,
but they are actually gamma-adjusted.

pamditherbw
is backward compatible with pgmtopbm except that
it

&bull;

does the correct gamma adjustments.

&bull;

produces PAM output instead of PBM. (Modern Netpbm
programs that accept PBM input also accept PAM input, but if
you need actual PBM, you can use pamtopnm with
pamditherbw). 

So use the
manual for pamditherbw for pgmtopbm, except
ignore anything that says it was added after Netpbm Release
10.23 and ignore any options that are not shown in the
synopsis above.

Although
pgmtopbm is mostly obsolete, the simple threshold
method (specified by -threshold) is an exception.
Unlike the other conversion methods, gamma-adjustment is not
an issue with simple thresholding and pgmtopbm can
produce PBM output directly. Note that even in this basic
mode of operation pgmtopbm may produce output which
is slightly different from what pamditherbw does
because of differences in internal calculation.

If you just
want to convert a PGM image with maxval 1 to PBM, use
pamtopnm(1).
