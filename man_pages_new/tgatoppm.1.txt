NAME

tgatoppm -
convert TrueVision Targa file to a PPM image

SYNOPSIS

tgatoppm

[--alphaout={alpha-filename,-}] 

[--headerdump] tga-filename

DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

tgatoppm
reads a TrueVision Targa file as input and produces a PPM
image as output.

OPTIONS

In addition to
the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most
notably -quiet, see
 Common Options ),
tgatoppm recognizes the following command line
options:

All options can
be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix. 
--alphaout=alpha-filename

tgatoppm creates a PGM
image containing the transparency channel values in the
input image. If the input image doesn&rsquo;t contain a
transparency channel, the alpha-filename file
contains all zero (transparent) transparency values. If you
don&rsquo;t specify --alphaout, tgatoppm does
not generate an alpha file, and if the input image has a
transparency channel, tgatoppm simply discards
it.

If you specify
- as the filename, tgatoppm writes the
transparency output to Standard Output and discards the
image.

See
pamcomp(1) for one way to use the transparency output
file.

--headerdump

Causes tgatoppm to dump
information from the TGA header to Standard Error.
