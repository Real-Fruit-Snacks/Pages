NAME

pbmtox10bm -
replaced by pbmtoxbm

DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

pbmtox10bm
was replaced in Netpbm 10.37 (December 2006) by
pbmtoxbm(1).

pbmtoxbm
with the -x10 option is backward compatible with
pbmtox10bm. pbmtoxbm also can generate X11
bitmaps.

You should not
make any new use of pbmtox10bm and if you modify an
existing use, you should upgrade to pbmtoxbm. But
note that if you write a program that might have to be used
with old Netpbm, pbmtox10bm is the only way to do
that.
