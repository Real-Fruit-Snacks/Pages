NAME

git-http-push -
Push objects over HTTP/DAV to another repository

SYNOPSIS

git
http-push [--all] [--dry-run] [--force] [--verbose]
  [...]

DESCRIPTION

Sends missing
objects to remote repository, and updates the remote
branch.

NOTE:
This command is temporarily disabled if your libcurl is
older than 7.16, as the combination has been reported not to
work and sometimes corrupts repository.

OPTIONS

--all

Do not assume that the remote
repository is complete in its current state, and verify all
objects in the entire local ref&rsquo;s history exist in the
remote repository.

--force

Usually, the command refuses to
update a remote ref that is not an ancestor of the local ref
used to overwrite it. This flag disables the check. What
this means is that the remote repository can lose commits;
use it with care.

--dry-run

Do everything except actually
send the updates.

--verbose

Report the list of objects
being walked locally and the list of objects successfully
sent to the remote repository.

-d, -D

Remove  from remote
repository. The specified branch cannot be the remote HEAD.
If -d is specified the following other conditions must also
be met:

&bull; Remote
HEAD must resolve to an object that exists locally

&bull;
Specified branch resolves to an object that exists
locally

&bull;
Specified branch is an ancestor of the remote HEAD

...

The remote refs to update.

SPECIFYING THE REFS

A
 specification can be either a single
pattern, or a pair of such patterns separated by a colon
":" (this means that a ref name cannot have a
colon in it). A single pattern  is just a
shorthand for :.

Each pattern
pair consists of the source side (before the colon) and the
destination side (after the colon). The ref to be pushed is
determined by finding a match that matches the source side,
and where it is pushed is determined by using the
destination side.

&bull; It is an
error if  does not match exactly one of the local
refs.

&bull; If
 does not match any remote ref, either

&bull; it has
to start with "refs/";  is used as the
destination literally in this case.

&bull;
 ==  and the ref that matched the
 must not exist in the set of remote refs; the
ref matched  locally is used as the name of the
destination.

Without
&rsquo;--force&rsquo;, the  ref is stored at the
remote only if  does not exist, or  is
a proper subset (i.e. an ancestor) of . This
check, known as "fast-forward check", is performed
in order to avoid accidentally overwriting the remote ref
and lose other peoples&rsquo; commits from there.

With
--force, the fast-forward check is disabled for all
refs.

Optionally, a
 parameter can be prefixed with a plus +
sign to disable the fast-forward check only on that ref.
