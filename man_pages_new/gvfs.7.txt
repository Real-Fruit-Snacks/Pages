NAME

gvfs - GIO
virtual file system

DESCRIPTION

GIO provides a
VFS API to GLib applications. It includes a 'local'
implementation using POSIX. gvfs provides implementations
that go beyond that and allow to access files and storage
using many protocols, such as ftp, http, sftp, dav, nfs,
etc. It also provides support for trash folders, for cd
burning and for monitoring interesting devices and volumes
on the computer.

Applications
use gvfs indirectly, by means of GIO loading the gvfs module
that implements the GIO extension points. The gvfs support
for volume monitoring is included in a separate loadable
module.

The actual gvfs
implementation is distributed over a number of processes.
None of these are expected to be started from the
commandline, except for debugging purposes.

Main
processes:

&bull; gvfsd -
the main gvfs daemon

&bull;
gvfsd-fuse - mounts gvfs as a fuse filesystem

&bull;
gvfsd-metadata - writes gvfs metadata

Volume
monitors:

&bull;
gvfs-afc-volume-monitor - a volume monitor for Apple
iPhone/iPod Touch devices

&bull;
gvfs-goa-volume-monitor - a volume monitor for GNOME Online
Accounts

&bull;
gvfs-gphoto2-volume-monitor - a volume monitor for PTP
devices

&bull;
gvfs-mtp-volume-monitor - a volume monitor for MTP
devices

&bull;
gvfs-udisks2-volume-monitor - a udisks2-based volume
monitor
