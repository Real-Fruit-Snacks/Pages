NAME

podman-network
- Manage Podman networks

SYNOPSIS

podman
network subcommand

DESCRIPTION

The network
command manages networks for Podman.

Podman supports
two network backends Netavark and CNI. Netavark is the
default network backend and was added in Podman version 4.0.
CNI is deprecated and will be removed in the next major
Podman version 5.0, in preference of Netavark. To configure
the network backend use the network_backend key under
the [Network] in containers.conf(5). New
systems use netavark by default, to check what backend is
used run podman info --format
{{.Host.NetworkBackend}}.

All network
commands work for both backends but CNI and Netavark use
different config files so networks have to be created again
after a backend change.

COMMANDS

SUBNET NOTES

Podman requires
specific default IPs and, thus, network subnets. The default
values used by Podman can be modified in the
containers.conf(5) file.

Podman
network 
The default bridge network (called podman) uses
10.88.0.0/16 as a subnet. When Podman runs as root, the
podman network is used as default. It is the same as
adding the option --network bridge or --network
podman. This subnet can be changed in
containers.conf(5) under the [network] section. Set
the default_subnet to any subnet that is free in the
environment. The name of the default network can also be
changed from podman to another name using the default
network key. Note that this is only done when no containers
are running.

Slirp4netns

When Podman is run as rootless, the internet connectivity is
provided with slirp4netns by default. Slirp4nents uses
10.0.2.0/24 for its default network. This can also be
changed in containers.conf(5) but under the
[engine] section. Use the network_cmd_options
key and add ["cidr=X.X.X.X/24"] as a value.
Note that slirp4netns needs a network prefix size between 1
and 25. This option accepts an array, so more options can be
added in a comma-separated string as described on the
podman-network-create(1) man page. To change the CIDR
for just one container, specify it on the cli using the
--network option like this: --network
slirp4netns:cidr=192.168.1.0/24.

When using the
default network as rootless, i.e. --network podman/bridge,
then it also uses the same subnet as described above in
addition to the slirp4netns subnet.

Podman
network create 
When a new network is created with a podman network
create command, and no subnet is given with the --subnet
option, Podman starts picking a free subnet from
10.89.0.0/24 to 10.255.255.0/24. Use the
default_subnet_pools option under the
[network] section in containers.conf(5) to
change the range and/or size that is assigned by
default.
