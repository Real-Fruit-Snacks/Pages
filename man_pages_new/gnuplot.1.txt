NAME

gnuplot &minus;
an interactive plotting program

SYNOPSIS

gnuplot
[ X11 options ] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION

Gnuplot
is a command-driven interactive function plotting
program.

If files are
given, gnuplot loads each file with the load
command, in the order specified. Gnuplot exits after
the last file is processed.

Here are some
of its features:

Plots any
number of functions, built up of C operators, C library
functions, and some things C doesn&rsquo;t have like **,
sgn(), etc. Also support for plotting data files, to compare
actual data to theoretical curves.

User-defined X
and Y ranges (optional auto-ranging), smart axes scaling,
smart tic marks.

Labelling of X
and Y axes.

User-defined
constants and functions.

Support for
many output devices and file formats

Shell escapes
and command line substitution.

Load and save
capability.

Output
redirection.

All
computations performed in the complex domain. Just the real
part is plotted by default, but functions like imag() and
abs() and arg() are available to override this.

X11 OPTIONS

Gnuplot
provides the x11 terminal type for use with X
servers. This terminal type is set automatically at startup
if the DISPLAY environment variable is set, if the
TERM environment variable is set to xterm, or
if the &minus;display command line option is used.
For terminal type x11, gnuplot accepts the
standard X Toolkit options and resources such as geometry,
font, and background. See the X(1) man page for a
description of the options. In addition to the X Toolkit
options:

&minus;clear
requests that the window be cleared momentarily before a new
plot is displayed.

&minus;gray
requests grayscale rendering on grayscale or color displays.
(Grayscale displays receive monochrome rendering by
default.)

&minus;mono
forces monochrome rendering on color displays.

&minus;persist
lets plot windows survive after main gnuplot program
exits.

-raise
raises the plot window after each plot.

-noraise
does not raise the plot window after each plot.

&minus;tvtwm
requests that geometry specifications for position of the
window be made relative to the currently displayed portion
of the virtual root.

These options
may also be controlled with resources in your
.Xdefaults file. For example: gnuplot*gray: on
.

Gnuplot
provides a command line option (&minus;pointsize
v) and a resource (gnuplot*pointsize:
v) to control the size of points plotted with the
"points" plotting style. The value v is a
real number (greater than 0 and less than or equal to ten)
used as a scaling factor for point sizes. For example,
&minus;pointsize 2 uses points twice the default
size, and &minus;pointsize 0.5 uses points half the
normal size.

For monochrome
displays, gnuplot does not honor foreground or
background colors. The default is black-on-white.
&minus;rv or gnuplot*reverseVideo: on requests
white-on-black.

For color
displays gnuplot honors the following resources
(shown here with default values). The values may be color
names in the X11 rgb.txt file on your system, hexadecimal
RGB color specifications (see X11 documentation), or a color
name followed by a comma and an intensity value from
0 to 1. For example, blue,.5 means a half intensity
blue.

gnuplot*background:
white 
gnuplot*textColor: black 
gnuplot*borderColor: black 
gnuplot*axisColor: black 
gnuplot*line1Color: red 
gnuplot*line2Color: green 
gnuplot*line3Color: blue 
gnuplot*line4Color: magenta 
gnuplot*line5Color: cyan 
gnuplot*line6Color: sienna 
gnuplot*line7Color: orange 
gnuplot*line8Color: coral

When
&minus;gray is selected, gnuplot honors the
following resources for grayscale or color displays (shown
here with default values). Note that the default background
is black.

gnuplot*background:
black 
gnuplot*textGray: white 
gnuplot*borderGray: gray50 
gnuplot*axisGray: gray50 
gnuplot*line1Gray: gray100 
gnuplot*line2Gray: gray60 
gnuplot*line3Gray: gray80 
gnuplot*line4Gray: gray40 
gnuplot*line5Gray: gray90 
gnuplot*line6Gray: gray50 
gnuplot*line7Gray: gray70 
gnuplot*line8Gray: gray30

Gnuplot
honors the following resources for setting the width in
pixels of plot lines (shown here with default values.) 0 or
1 means a minimal width line of 1 pixel width. A value of 2
or 3 may improve the appearance of some plots.

gnuplot*borderWidth:
2 
gnuplot*axisWidth: 0 
gnuplot*line1Width: 0 
gnuplot*line2Width: 0 
gnuplot*line3Width: 0 
gnuplot*line4Width: 0 
gnuplot*line5Width: 0 
gnuplot*line6Width: 0 
gnuplot*line7Width: 0 
gnuplot*line8Width: 0

Gnuplot
honors the following resources for setting the dash style
used for plotting lines. 0 means a solid line. A 2 digit
number jk (j and k are >= 1 and
j pixels on followed by k pixels off. For
example, &rsquo;16&rsquo; is a "dotted" line with
1 pixel on followed by 6 pixels off. More elaborate on/off
patterns can be specified with a 4 digit value. For example,
&rsquo;4441&rsquo; is 4 on, 4 off, 4 on, 1 off. The default
values shown below are for monochrome displays or monochrome
rendering on color or grayscale displays. For color
displays, the defaults for all are 0 (solid line) except for
axisDashes which defaults to a &rsquo;16&rsquo;
dotted line.

gnuplot*borderDashes:
0 
gnuplot*axisDashes: 16 
gnuplot*line1Dashes: 0 
gnuplot*line2Dashes: 42 
gnuplot*line3Dashes: 13 
gnuplot*line4Dashes: 44 
gnuplot*line5Dashes: 15 
gnuplot*line6Dashes: 4441 
gnuplot*line7Dashes: 42 
gnuplot*line8Dashes: 13

The size or
aspect ratio of a plot may be changed by resizing the
gnuplot window.
