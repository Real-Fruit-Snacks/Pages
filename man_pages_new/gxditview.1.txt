Description

gxditview
interprets and displays the intermediate output format of
groff(1) on an X11 display. It uses the standard
X11 fonts, so it does not require access to the server
machine for font loading. There are several ways to use
gxditview.

The
intermediate output format of groff, documented in
groff_out(5), is produced by troff or the
-Z option to groff. It can be viewed by
explicitly calling &ldquo;gxditview
file&rdquo;. If the file operand is
&ldquo;-&rdquo;, gxditview will read the
standard input stream; file cannot be omitted. The
intermediate output format of groff is
device-independent but not device-agnostic. gxditview
can view it for all typesetter devices, but the quality is
device-dependent. gxditview will not display output
for terminal (nroff) devices.

The best
results are achieved with the X* devices for
groff&rsquo;s -T option, of which there are
four: -TX75, -TX75-12, -TX100, and
-TX100-12. They differ by the X resolution (75
or 100 dots per inch) and the base point size (10 or 12
points). They are especially built for gxditview.
When using one of these, groff generates the
intermediate output for this device and calls
gxditview automatically for viewing.

-X
produces good results only with -Tps, -TX75,
-TX75-12, -TX100, and -TX100-12. The
default resolution for previewing -Tps output is
75dpi; this can be changed with the -resolution
option.

While
gxditview is running, the left mouse button brings up
a menu with several entries.

Next Page

Display the next page.

Previous Page

Display the previous page.

Select Page

Select a particular numbered page specified by a dialog
box. 

Print

Print the groff intermediate output using a
command specified by a dialog box. The default command
initially displayed is controlled by the printCommand
application resource, and by the -printCommand
option. 

Open

Open for display a new file specified by a dialog box.
The file should contain groff intermediate output. If
the filename starts with a bar or pipe symbol,
&ldquo;|&rdquo; it will be interpreted as a command
from which to read.

Quit

Exit from gxditview.

The menu
entries correspond to actions with similar but not identical
names, which can also be accessed with keyboard
accelerators. The n, Space, Return, and
Next (PgDn) keys are bound to the
NextPage action. The p, b,
BackSpace, Delete, and Prior
(PgUp) keys are bound to the PreviousPage
action. The g key is bound to the SelectPage
action. The o key is bound to the OpenFile
action. The q key is bound to the Quit action.
The r key is bound to a Rerasterize action
which rereads the current file, and redisplays the current
page; if the current file is a command, the command will be
re-executed. Vertical scrolling can be done with the
k and j keys; horizontal scrolling is bound to
the h and l keys. The arrow keys (up,
down, left, and right) are also bound
to the obvious scrolling actions.

The
paperlength and paperwidth commands in the
DESC file describing a groff output device
specify the length and width in machine units of the virtual
page displayed by gxditview; see
groff_font(5).

X
defaults 
This program uses the Dvi widget from the
X Toolkit. It understands all of the core resource
names and classes as well as: 
width (class Width)

Specifies the width of the
window.

height (class Height)

Specifies the height of the
window.

foreground (class Foreground)

Specifies the default
foreground color.

font (class Font)

Specifies the font to be used
for error messages.

fontMap (class FontMap)

Specifies the mapping from
groff font names to X font names. This must be a
string containing a sequence of lines. Each line contains
two whitespace-separated fields: firstly the groff
font name, and secondly the XLFD (X Logical Font
Description). The default is shown in subsection
&ldquo;Default font map&rdquo; below.

Default font
map 
XLFDs are long and unwieldy, so some lines are shown broken
and indented below.

Options

-help
and --help display a usage message, while
-version and --version show version
information; all exit afterward.

gxditview
accepts all of the standard X Toolkit command-line
options along with the additional options listed below.

-page

This option specifies the page number of the document to
be displayed.

-backingStore backing-store-type

Because redisplay of the
groff intermediate output window can take a
perceiptible amount of time, this option causes the server
to save the window contents so that when it is scrolled
around the viewport, the window is painted from contents
saved in backing store. backing-store-type can be one
of Always, WhenMapped or NotUseful.

-printCommand command

The default command displayed
in the dialog box for the Print menu entry will be
command.

-resolution res

The groff intermediate
output file will be displayed at a resolution of res
dots per inch, unless the DESC file contains the
X11 command, in which case the device resolution will
be used. This corresponds to the Dvi widget&rsquo;s
resolution resource. The default is 75.

-filename string

The default filename displayed
in the dialog box for the Open menu entry will be
string. This can be either a filename, or a command
starting with &ldquo;|&rdquo;.

The following
standard X Toolkit command-line arguments are commonly
used with gxditview. 
-bg color

This option specifies the color
to use for the background of the window. The default is
&ldquo;white&rdquo;.

-bd color

This option specifies the color
to use for the border of the window. The default is
&ldquo;black&rdquo;.

-bw number

This option specifies the width
in pixels of the border surrounding the window.

-fg color

This option specifies the color
to use for displaying text. The default is
&ldquo;black&rdquo;.

-fn font

This option specifies the font
to be used for displaying widget text. The default is
&ldquo;fixed&rdquo;.

-rv

This option indicates that reverse video should be
simulated by swapping the foreground and background
colors. 

-geometry geometry

This option specifies the
preferred size and position of the window.

-display host:display

This option specifies the
X server to contact.

-xrm resourcestring

This option specifies a
resource string to be used.

Environment

GROFF_FONT_PATH

A list of directories in which
to seek the selected output device&rsquo;s directory of
device and font description files. See troff(1) and
groff_font(5).

Files

/etc/X11/app-defaults/GXditview

/etc/X11/app-defaults/GXditview-color

define X application defaults
for gxditview. Users can override these values in the
.Xdefaults file, normally located in the user&rsquo;s
home directory. See appres(1) and xrdb(1).

/usr/share/groff/1.23.0/font/devX100/DESC

describes the X100
output device.

/usr/share/groff/1.23.0/font/devX100/F

describes the font known
as F on device X100.

/usr/share/groff/1.23.0/font/devX100-12/DESC

describes the X100-12
output device.

/usr/share/groff/1.23.0/font/devX100-12/F

describes the font known
as F on device X100-12.

/usr/share/groff/1.23.0/font/devX75/DESC

describes the X75 output
device.

/usr/share/groff/1.23.0/font/devX75/F

describes the font known
as F on device X75.

/usr/share/groff/1.23.0/font/devX75-12/DESC

describes the X75-12
output device.

/usr/share/groff/1.23.0/font/devX75-12/F

describes the font known
as F on device X75-12.

/usr/share/groff/1.23.0/tmac/X.tmac

defines macros for use with the
X100, X100-12, X75, and X75-12
output devices. It is automatically loaded by troffrc
when any of those output devices is selected.

/usr/share/groff/1.23.0/tmac/Xps.tmac

sets up troff to use
gxditview as a previewer for device-independent
output targeting the ps output device. It is
automatically loaded by troffrc when troff is
given the options -X and -Tps.

Examples

The following
command views this man page with a base point size of
12.

groff -TX100-12
-man gxditview.1

The quality of
the result depends mainly on the chosen point size and
display resolution; for rapid previewing, however, something
like

groff -X -P-resolution
-P100 document

yields acceptable results.
