NAME

calamares -
distribution-independent system installer

SYNOPSIS

calamares
[options]

DESCRIPTION

calamares
is a distribution-independent system installer, with an
advanced partitioning feature for both manual and automated
partitioning operations. It is the first installer with an
automated &ldquo;Replace Partition&rdquo; option, which
makes it easy to reuse a partition over and over for
distribution testing. Calamares is designed to be
customizable by distribution maintainers without need for
cumbersome patching, thanks to third party branding and
external modules support.
