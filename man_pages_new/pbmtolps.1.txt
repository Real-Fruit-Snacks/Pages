NAME

pbmtolps -
convert PBM image to PostScript

SYNOPSIS

pbmtolps
[-dpi=n] [pbmfile]

Minimum unique
abbreviation of option is acceptable. You may use double
hyphens instead of single hyphen to denote options. You may
use white space in place of the equals sign to separate an
option name from its value.

DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

pbmtolps
reads a PBM image as input and outputs PostScript. The
output Postscript uses lines instead of the image operator
to generate a (device dependent) picture which will be
imaged much faster.

pnmtops
is a more general program for converting from the Netpbm
formats to Postscript, though it cannot produce the
particular arcane subformat that pbmtolps does.

One pixel of
the input image corresponds to one printed pixel
(&rsquo;dot&rsquo;). For this to work, you must use a
-dpi option to tell pmtolps the resolution of
the target printer, in dots per inch.

The Postscript
program pbmtolps generates draws paths of less than
1000 segments so as not to overrun limits on the Apple
Laserwriter and possibly other printers.

OPTIONS

In addition to
the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most
notably -quiet, see
 Common Options ),
pbmtolps recognizes the following command line
option:

-dpi=n

The resolution of the target printer, in dots per
inch.
