NAME

piv-tool -
smart card utility for HSPD-12 PIV cards

SYNOPSIS

piv-tool
[OPTIONS] 

 The piv-tool utility can be used from the command line to performmiscellaneous smart card operations on a HSPD-12 PIV smart card asdefined in NIST 800-73-3. It is intended for use with test cards only.It can be used to load objects, and generate key pairs, as well as sendarbitrary APDU commands to a card after having authenticated to thecard using the card key provided by the card vendor.OPTIONS

--serial

Print the card serial number
derived from the CHUID object, if any. Output is in hex byte
format.

--name,
-n

Print the name of the inserted
card (driver)

--admin
argument, -A argument

Authenticate to the card using
a 2DES, 3DES or AES key. The argument of the form

{A|M}:ref:alg

is required,
were A uses "EXTERNAL AUTHENTICATION" and M uses
"MUTUAL AUTHENTICATION". ref is normally
9B, and alg is 03 for 3DES, 01 for 2DES, 08 for
AES-128, 0A for AES-192 or 0C for AES-256. The key is
provided by the card vendor. The environment variable
PIV_EXT_AUTH_KEY must point to either a binary file
matching the length of the key or a text file containing the
key in the format:
XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX

--genkey
argument, -G argument

Generate a key pair on the card
and output the public key. The argument of the
form

ref:alg

is required,
where ref is 9A, 9C, 9D or 9E and alg is 06,
07, 11 or 14 for RSA 1024, RSA 2048, ECC 256 or ECC 384
respectively.

--object
ContainerID, -O ContainerID

Load an object onto the card.
The ContainerID is as defined in NIST 800-73-n
without leading 0x. Example: CHUID object is 3000

--cert
ref, -C ref

Load a certificate onto the
card. ref is 9A, 9C, 9D or 9E

--compresscert
ref, -Z ref

Load a certificate that has
been gzipped onto the card. ref is 9A, 9C, 9D or
9E

--out
file, -o file

Output file for any operation
that produces output.

--in
file, -i file

Input file for any operation
that requires an input file.

--key-slots-discovery
file

Print properties of the key
slots. Needs 'admin' authentication.

--send-apdu
apdu, -s apdu

Sends an arbitrary APDU to the
card in the format AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF.... This option may be
repeated.

--reader
arg, -r arg

Number of the reader to use. By
default, the first reader with a present card is used. If
arg is an ATR, the reader with a matching card will
be chosen.

--wait,
-w

Wait for a card to be
inserted

--verbose,
-v

Causes piv-tool to be
more verbose. Specify this flag several times to enable
debug output in the opensc library.
