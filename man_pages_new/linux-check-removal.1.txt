NAME

linux&minus;check&minus;removal
&minus; check whether removal of a kernel is safe

SYNOPSIS

linux&minus;check&minus;removal VERSION 

DESCRIPTION

linux&minus;check&minus;removal
is intended to be called from the prerm maintainer scripts
of Linux kernel packages.

The
VERSION argument must be the kernel version string as
shown by uname -r and used in filenames.

If the
currently running kernel matches VERSION,
linux&minus;check&minus;removal normally prompts the
user to confirm this potentially dangerous action and fails
if the user chooses to abort. There are two exceptions to
this behaviour:

&bull;

If the current environment is a chroot or container, it
is assumed that the running kernel is independent of any
installed kernel package and the command always quietly
succeeds 

&bull;

If debconf prompts are disabled, the command warns if
removing the running kernel but always succeeds

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

DEBIAN_FRONTEND

Name of the preferred debconf
front-end. If set to noninteractive, debconf prompts
are disabled and linux&minus;check&minus;removal
always quietly succeeds.

DPKG_MAINTSCRIPT_PACKAGE

Name of the package to be
removed, automatically set by dpkg.
