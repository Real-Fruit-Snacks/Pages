NAME

posix_spawnattr_getsigmask,
posix_spawnattr_setsigmask &mdash; get and set the
spawn-sigmask attribute of a spawn attributes object
(ADVANCED REALTIME)

SYNOPSIS

#include

#include 

int
posix_spawnattr_getsigmask(const posix_spawnattr_t *restrict
attr, 
sigset_t *restrict sigmask); 
int posix_spawnattr_setsigmask(posix_spawnattr_t *restrict
attr, 
const sigset_t *restrict sigmask);

DESCRIPTION

The
posix_spawnattr_getsigmask() function shall obtain
the value of the spawn-sigmask attribute from the
attributes object referenced by attr.

The
posix_spawnattr_setsigmask() function shall set the
spawn-sigmask attribute in an initialized attributes
object referenced by attr.

The
spawn-sigmask attribute represents the signal mask in
effect in the new process image of a spawn operation (if
POSIX_SPAWN_SETSIGMASK is set in the spawn-flags
attribute). The default value of this attribute is
unspecified.

RETURN VALUE

Upon successful
completion, posix_spawnattr_getsigmask() shall return
zero and store the value of the spawn-sigmask
attribute of attr into the object referenced by the
sigmask parameter; otherwise, an error number shall
be returned to indicate the error.

Upon successful
completion, posix_spawnattr_setsigmask() shall return
zero; otherwise, an error number shall be returned to
indicate the error.

ERRORS

These functions
may fail if:

EINVAL

The value specified by attr is invalid.

The
posix_spawnattr_setsigmask() function may fail
if:

EINVAL

The value of the attribute being
set is not valid.
