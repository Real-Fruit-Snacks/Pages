SYNOPSIS

systemd-logind.service

/usr/lib/systemd/systemd-logind

DESCRIPTION

systemd-logind
is a system service that manages user logins. It is
responsible for:

&bull; Keeping
track of users and sessions, their processes and their idle
state. This is implemented by allocating a systemd slice
unit for each user below user.slice, and a scope unit below
it for each concurrent session of a user. Also, a per-user
service manager is started as system service instance of
user@.service for each logged in user.

&bull;
Generating and managing session IDs. If auditing is
available and an audit session ID is already set for a
session, then this ID is reused as the session ID.
Otherwise, an independent session counter is used.

&bull;
Providing polkit
[1]
-based access for users for operations
such as system shutdown or sleep

&bull;
Implementing a shutdown/sleep inhibition logic for
applications

&bull;
Handling of power/sleep hardware keys

&bull;
Multi-seat management

&bull;
Session switch management

&bull;
Device access management for users

&bull;
Automatic spawning of text logins (gettys) on virtual
