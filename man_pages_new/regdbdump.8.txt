SYNOPSIS

regdbdump

Description

regdbdump
can be used to parse the regulatory.bin file, the
Linux wireless regulatory database used by crda, and
print out its contents in human readable format.
regdbdump will return non zero if the digital
signature regdbdump was built with cannot verify the
signature of the regulatory database. Should this happen
unintentionally chances are your regulatory.bin file is
corrupted or has been tampered with.
