NAME

onionshare - a
tool for anonymously sharing files over a temporarily set up
Tor Hidden service.

SYNOPSIS

onionshare
[options] filename

DESCRIPTION

OnionShare
lets you anonymously share files. This works either in send
or in receive mode. OnionShare sets up use a Tor hidden
service to either make files on your computer temporarily
accessible over the Internet, or allows the uploading of
files to your computer using a hidden service. OnionShare
generates an unguessable URL to down- or upload files that
you can share with your peers.

In case of
sharing with many peers, please enable "Public
mode", otherwise OnionShare might interpret multiple
accesses as an attack and shut down the hidden service.

OnionShare can
configured to run with it&rsquo;s built-in version of tor, a
TorBrowser or system tor running in the background. By
default, OnionShare uses the built-in version of Tor.

In the case of
OnionShare, the crypto key lives in
/tmp/onionshare/tmpXXX/private_key. The .onion URL address
itself is a fingerprint of the key, which lets the Tor
network look up the public key and start an encrypted
session. So as long as you transmit the OnionShare URL
successfully, the recipient who loads it in Tor Browser gets
an end-to-end encrypted session with the server.

OnionShare&rsquo;s
default behaviour is to shut down the hidden service and to
stop once the file has been downloaded. You can prevent this
behaviour by invoking the --stay-open option. This can be
useful if you want multiple people to access the same
file.
