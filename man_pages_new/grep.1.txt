NAME

grep, g -
search a file for a pattern

SYNOPSIS

grep [
option ... ] pattern [ file ... ]

g [
option ... ] pattern [ file ... ]

DESCRIPTION

Grep
searches the input files (standard input default) for
lines that match the pattern, a regular expression as
defined in regexp(7) with the addition of a newline
character as an alternative (substitute for |) with
lowest precedence. Normally, each line matching the pattern
is &rsquo;selected&rsquo;, and each selected line is copied
to the standard output. The options are

-c

Print only a count of matching lines.

-h

Do not print file name tags (headers) with output
lines. 

-e

The following argument is taken as a pattern.
This option makes it easy to specify patterns that might
confuse argument parsing, such as -n.

-i

Ignore alphabetic case distinctions. The implementation
folds into lower case all letters in the pattern and input
before interpretation. Matched lines are printed in their
original form.

-l

(ell) Print the names of files with selected lines;
don&rsquo;t print the lines.

-L

Print the names of files with no selected lines; the
converse of -l.

-n

Mark each printed line with its line number counted in
its file.

-s

Produce no output, but return status.

-v

Reverse: print lines that do not match the pattern.

-f

The pattern argument is the name of a file containing
regular expressions one per line.

-b

Don&rsquo;t buffer the output: write each output line as
soon as it is discovered.

Output lines
are tagged by file name when there is more than one input
file. (To force this tagging, include /dev/null as a
file name argument.)

Care should be
taken when using the shell metacharacters $*[^|()=\
and newline in pattern; it is safest to enclose the
entire expression in single quotes
&rsquo;...&rsquo;. An expression starting with
&rsquo;*&rsquo; will treat the rest of the expression as
literal characters.

G
invokes grep with -n and forces tagging of output
lines by file name. If no files are listed, it searches all
files matching

*.C *.b *.c *.h
*.m *.cc *.java *.cgi *.pl *.py *.tex *.ms

DIAGNOSTICS

Exit status is

are selected or an error occurs.
