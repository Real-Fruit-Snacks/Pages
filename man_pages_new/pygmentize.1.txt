DESCRIPTION

Pygments is a
generic syntax highlighter for general use in all kinds of
software such as forum systems, wikis or other applications
that need to prettify source code.

Its highlights
are: 
* a wide range of common languages and markup formats is
supported 
* special attention is paid to details, increasing quality
by a fair amount 
* support for new languages and formats are added easily

* a number of output formats, presently HTML, LaTeX and ANSI
sequences 
* it is usable as a command-line tool and as a library 
* ... and it highlights even Brainfuck!

pygmentize
is a command that uses Pygments to highlight the input file
and write the result to . If no
 is given, stdin is used.

OPTIONS

A summary of
options is included below. 
-l 

Set the lexer name. If not
given, the lexer is guessed from the extension of the input
file name (this obviously doesn&rsquo;t work if the input is
stdin).

-g

Attempt to guess the lexer from the file contents, or
pass through as plain text if this fails (this can work for
stdin). 

-F
[:]

Add a filter to the token
stream. You can give options in the same way as for -O after
a colon (note: there must not be spaces around the colon).
This option can be given multiple times.

-f

Set the formatter name. If not
given, it will be guessed from the extension of the output
file name. If no output file is given, the terminal
formatter will be used by default.

-o

Set output file. If not given,
stdout is used.

-O

With this option, you can give
the lexer and formatter a comma-separated list of options,
e.g. "-O bg=light,python=cool". Which options are
valid for which lexers and formatters can be found in the
documentation. This option can be given multiple times.

-P

This option adds lexer and
formatter options like the -O option, but you can only give
one option per -P. That way, the option value may contain
commas and equals signs, which it can&rsquo;t with -O.

-S

Print out style definitions for
style  and for formatter
. The meaning of the argument given
by -a  is formatter dependent and
can be found in the documentation.

-L [
...]

List lexers, formatters, styles
or filters. Set  to the thing you want
to list (e.g. "styles"), or omit it to list
everything.

-H 

Print detailed help for the
object  of type ,
where  is one of "lexer",
"formatter" or "filter".

-h

Show help screen.

-V

Show version of the Pygments package.
