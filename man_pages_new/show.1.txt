show - display
nmh messages

SYNOPSIS

show

[-help] [-version]
[+folder] [msgs] [-draft]
[-showproc program] [-showmimeproc
program] [-header | -noheader]
[-checkmime | -nocheckmime] [-concat |
-noconcat] [switches for showproc or
showmimeproc] 

DESCRIPTION

show
lists each of the specified messages to the standard output
(typically, the terminal).

By default,
text (non-MIME) messages are filtered and displayed by the
nmh command mhl. This command will display
text messages in a nice, uniform format. It also allows you
to configure the format of the displayed messages and which
headers fields are shown. See the mhl(1) manual page
for the details about this command. This default can be
changed by defining the showproc profile component.
Any switches not recognized by show, as well as
-header and -noheader, are passed along to
that program. To override the default and the
showproc profile component, use the -showproc
program switch. For example, -showproc
more will cause the more program to list the
messages with no reformatting. Normally, this program is
specified as the showproc in the user&rsquo;s
.mh_profile, rather than using a command line
switch.

By default,
non-text messages (MIME messages with multi-media contents)
are processed and displayed by the nmh command
mhshow. See the mhshow(1) manual page for
details about this command. This default can changed by
defining the showmimeproc profile component. Any
switches not recognized by show are passed along to
that program. To override this default and the
showmimeproc profile component, use the
-showmimeproc program switch.

Note that in
some cases, show may invoke the showmimeproc
even for textual contents. This will happen for text
messages that specify a transfer encoding (such as MIME
quoted-printable or base64) or specify a character set that
show doesn&rsquo;t believe can be displayed natively.
The appropriate locale(1) environment variables
should be set to the terminal&rsquo;s native character set
to avoid gratuitous invocations of the showmimeproc.
See locale(1) for details about these environment
variables.

The option
-checkmime (set by default) instructs show to
test if any of the messages to be displayed are non-text
(MIME) messages. If any are non-text, they are displayed by
the program showmimeproc, else they are displayed by
the program showproc. The option -nocheckmime
disables this test and instructs show to use
showproc, regardless of whether any of the messages
are non-text (MIME) messages.

The
-noshowproc switch will disable any formatting or
paging of messages. It is equivalent to -nocheckmime
-showproc cat. It is still accepted, but should
be considered (somewhat) obsolete.

The
-header switch tells show to display a
one-line description of the message being shown. This
description includes the folder and the message number.

By default
show will concatenate all content under one pager. If
you want each part to displayed separately, you can override
the default behavior with -noconcat.

If no
&rsquo;msgs&rsquo; are specified, the current message is
used. Although it depends on the specific showproc or
showmimeproc, in the default setup when more than one
message is specified, you will be prompted for a
 prior to listing each message. Each message
will be listed a page at a time, and when the end of page is
reached, the program will wait for a  or
. If a  is entered, it will
print the next line, whereas  will print the
next screenful.

If the standard
output is not a terminal, no queries are made, and each file
is listed with a one-line header and two lines of
separation.

&ldquo;show
-draft&rdquo; will list the file /draft if
it exists.

If the profile
entry &ldquo;Unseen-Sequence&rdquo; is present and
non-empty, then show will remove each of the messages
shown from each sequence named by the profile entry.

PROFILE COMPONENTS

Path: To
determine the user&rsquo;s nmh directory

DEFAULTS

&rsquo;+folder&rsquo;
defaults to the current folder 
&rsquo;msgs&rsquo; defaults to cur 
&rsquo;-checkmime&rsquo; 
&rsquo;-header&rsquo; 
&rsquo;-concat&rsquo;

CONTEXT

If a folder is
given, it will become the current folder. The last message
selected will become the current message.

BUGS

The
-header switch doesn&rsquo;t work when
&rsquo;msgs&rsquo; expands to more than one message. If the
showproc is mhl, then this problem can be
circumvented by referencing the &ldquo;messagename&rdquo;
field in the mhl format file.

show
updates the user&rsquo;s context before showing the message.
Hence show will mark messages as seen prior to the
user actually seeing them. This is generally not a problem,
unless the user relies on the &ldquo;unseen&rdquo; messages
mechanism, and interrupts show while it is showing
&ldquo;unseen&rdquo; messages.

If your
showproc is mhl (the default), then
show uses a built-in mhl: it does not actually
run the mhl program. Hence, if you define your own
showproc, don&rsquo;t call it mhl since
show won&rsquo;t run it.

If your
showproc is the pager more, then avoid running
show in the background with only its standard output
piped to another process, as in

show | imprint
&

Due to a bug in
more, show will go into a &ldquo;tty input&rdquo;
state. To avoid this problem, re-direct show&rsquo;s
diagnostic output as well. For users of csh:

show |&
imprint &

For users of
sh:

show
2>&1 | imprint &
