FIREWIRE(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual FIREWIRE(4)

NAME

firewire &mdash; IEEE1394
High-performance Serial Bus

SYNOPSIS

To compile this driver into the
kernel, place the following line in your kernel
configuration file:

device
firewire

Alternatively,
to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following line in loader.conf(5):

firewire_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION

FreeBSD provides
machine-independent bus support and raw drivers for
firewire interfaces.

The
firewire driver consists of two layers: the
controller and the bus layer. The controller attaches to a
physical bus (like pci(4)). The firewire bus attaches
to the controller. Additional drivers can be attached to the
bus.

Up to 63
devices, including the host itself, can be attached to a
firewire bus. The root node is dynamically assigned
with a PHY device function. Also, the other firewire
bus specific parameters, e.g., node ID, cycle master,
isochronous resource manager and bus manager, are
dynamically assigned, after bus reset is initiated. On the
firewire bus, every device is identified by an EUI 64
address.

Debugging over
the firewire interace is possible with the dcons(4) driver.
Please see https://wiki.freebsd.org/DebugWithDcons
for details on how to setup debugging with firewire.
