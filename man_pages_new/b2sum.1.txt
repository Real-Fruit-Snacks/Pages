NAME

b2sum - compute
and check BLAKE2 message digest

SYNOPSIS

b2sum
[OPTION]... [FILE]...

DESCRIPTION

Print or check
BLAKE2b (512-bit) checksums.

With no FILE,
or when FILE is -, read standard input.

Mandatory
arguments to long options are mandatory for short options
too. 
-b, --binary

read in binary mode

-c, --check

read checksums from the FILEs
and check them

-l,
--length=BITS

digest length in bits; must not
exceed the max for the blake2 algorithm and must be a
multiple of 8

--tag

create a BSD-style checksum

-t, --text

read in text mode (default)

-z, --zero

end each output line with NUL,
not newline, and disable file name escaping

The
following five options are useful only when verifying
checksums: 
--ignore-missing

don&rsquo;t fail or report
status for missing files

--quiet

don&rsquo;t print OK for each
successfully verified file

--status

don&rsquo;t output anything,
status code shows success

--strict

exit non-zero for improperly
formatted checksum lines

-w, --warn

warn about improperly formatted
checksum lines

--help

display this help and exit

--version

output version information and
exit

The sums are
computed as described in RFC 7693. When checking, the input
should be a former output of this program. The default mode
is to print a line with: checksum, a space, a character
indicating input mode (&rsquo;*&rsquo; for binary, &rsquo;
&rsquo; for text or where binary is insignificant), and name
for each FILE.

Note: There is
no difference between binary mode and text mode on GNU
systems.
