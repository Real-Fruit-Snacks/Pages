NAME

pamseq -
generate PAM image of a numerical sequence of tuple
values

SYNOPSIS

pamseq
[-tupletype=tupletype] depth maxval
[-min=n,n,...]
[-max=n,n,...]
[-step=n,n,...]

All options can
be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix. You may use
two hyphens instead of one to designate an option. You may
use either white space or an equals sign between an option
name and its value.

DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

pamseq
generates a PAM image of a specified depth and specified

maxval that consists of a single row. The row consists of
tuples 
containing sample values in a numerical sequence.

For example

pamseq 1 4

generates a 5
pixel wide image of 1 row with depth 1 tuples containing
these 
samples, in order from left to right:

0 1 2 3 4

The following
example uses depth 2:

pamseq 2 2

The resulting
image is a 9 pixel wide image of 1 row with depth 2
containing 
these samples, in order from left to right;

(0,0) (0,1)
(0,2) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (2,0) (2,1) 2,2)

You can choose
the starting and ending sample values and the step for each

plane: Here is an example of that:

pamseq 1 255
-min=4 -max=8 -step=2

This
generates

4 6 8

In two
dimensions:

pamseq 2 255
-min=0,4 -max=2,8 -step=1,2

(0,4) (0,6)
(0,8) (1,4) (1,6) (1,8) (2,4) (2,6) (2,8)

pamseq
varies first the highest numbered plane, then the next lower

numbered plane, etc. Within each plane, the program varies
from low sample 
value to high.

OPTIONS

In addition to
the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most
notably -quiet, see
 Common Options ),
pamseq recognizes the following command line options:

-tupletype

This is the value of the
"tuple_type" attribute of the created PAM image.
It can be any string up to 255 characters.

-min=n,n,...

This gives the starting value
for the sequence in each plane. The number 
of comma-separated numbers must be equal to the number of
planes in the 
image (its depth). Each number must be a whole number no
greater than 
the maxval of the image. The first number is for Plane 0,
the second for 
Plane 1, etc.

The default is
0 in every plane.

This option was
new in Netpbm 10.99 (June 2022).

-max=n,n,...

This is
analogous to -min, giving the ending value for the

sequence.

Each value must
be at least as great as the corresponding -min 
value.

The default is
the maxval in every plane.

This option was
new in Netpbm 10.99 (June 2022).

-step=n,n,...

This is
analogous to -min, giving the step value for the 
sequence (difference between two consecutive numbers).

Each value must
be positive and no greater than the maxval.

The default is
1.

This option was
new in Netpbm 10.99 (June 2022).

USAGE

To create a
simple ramp of the values 0..255, for input to various
matrix calculations, try 
pamseq 1 255

(Before
pamseq existed, pgmramp was often pressed into
service for this).

To create a PPM
color map of all the possible colors representable with a
maxval of 5, do 
pamseq 3 5 -tupletype=RGB | pamtopnm

Again, with a
modern program based on the Netpbm library, you don&rsquo;t
need the pamtopnm because a PAM RGB image is
equivalent to a PPM image.

You can use
such a color map with pnmremap(1) to quantize the
colors in an image. With the maxval of 5 given in the
example, you get a color map of the set of "web
safe" colors as defined by Netscape. Most web browsers
guarantee that they can produce at least these 216 colors
(215 plus black).

pamrestack
can often produce a useful two-dimensional image from
pamseq&rsquo;s single row.

pamseq 2 255
-min=0,4 -max=2,8 -step=1,2 | pamrestack -width=3

(0,4) (0,6)
(0,8) 
(1,4) (1,6) (1,8) 
(2,4) (2,6) (2,8)

HISTORY

pamseq
was added to Netpbm in June 2002.
