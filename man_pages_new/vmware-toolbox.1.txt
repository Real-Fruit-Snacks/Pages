&minus; GUI toolbox

SYNOPSIS

vmware&minus;toolbox

DESCRIPTION

This is a
per&minus;user process that, like
vmware&minus;user(1), must be run in an X11 session,
and isn&rsquo;t needed otherwise. Also like
vmware&minus;user(1), it does not support multiple
concurrent users, and depends on certain Gtk shared objects
at runtime.

OPTIONS

has no options.
