NAME

pbmtopgm -
convert PBM image to PGM by averaging areas

SYNOPSIS

pbmtopgm
width height [pbmfile]

DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

pbmtopgm
reads a PBM image as input. It outputs a PGM image in which
each pixel&rsquo;s gray level is the average of the
surrounding black and white input pixels. The surrounding
area is a rectangle of width by height
pixels.

In other words,
this is a convolution. pbmtopgm is similar to a
special case of pnmconvol.

You may need a
pnmsmooth step after pbmtopgm.

pbmtopgm
has the effect of anti-aliasing bitmaps which contain
distinct line features.

pbmtopgm
works best with odd sample width and heights.

You don&rsquo;t
need pbmtopgm just to use a PGM program on a PBM
image. Any PGM program (assuming it uses the Netpbm
libraries to read the PGM input) takes PBM input as if it
were PGM, with only the minimum and maximum gray levels. So
unless your convolution rectangle is bigger than one pixel,
you&rsquo;re not gaining anything with a pbmtopgm
step.

The opposite
transformation (which would turn a PGM into a PBM) is
dithering. See pamditherbw.

OPTIONS

There are no
command line options defined specifically for
pbmtopgm, but it recognizes the options common to all
programs based on libnetpbm (See
 Common Options
.)
