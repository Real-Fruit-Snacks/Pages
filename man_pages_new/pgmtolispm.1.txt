NAME

pgmtolispm -
convert a PGM image to Lisp Machine format

SYNOPSIS

pgmtolispm

[pgmfile]

DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

pgmtolispm
reads a PGM image as input and produces a Lisp Machine
bitmap as output.

This is the
file format read by the tv:read-bit-array-file function on
TI Explorer and Symbolics lisp machines.

Given a PGM
(instead of a PBM), pgmtolispm outputs a multi-plane
image. This is probably not useful unless you have a color
lisp machine.

Multi-plane
bitmaps on lisp machines are color; but the lispm image file
format does not include a color map, so we must treat it as
a graymap instead. This is unfortunate.

OPTIONS

There are no
command line options defined specifically for
pgmtolispm, but it recognizes the options common to
all programs based on libnetpbm (See
 Common Options
.)

SEE ALSO

lispmtopgm(1),
pgm(1)

LIMITATIONS

Output width is
always rounded up to the nearest multiple of 32; this might
not always be what you want, but it probably is (arrays
which are not modulo 32 cannot be passed to the Lispm BITBLT
function, and thus cannot easily be displayed on the
screen).

No color.
