NAME

date - date and
time

SYNOPSIS

date [
option ] [ seconds ]

DESCRIPTION

Print the date,
in the format

Tue Aug 16 17:03:52 CDT 1977

The options
are

-u

Report Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) rather than local
time. 

-n

Report the date as the number of seconds since the
epoch, 00:00:00 GMT, January 1, 1970.

The conversion
from Greenwich Mean Time to local time depends on the
$timezone environment variable; see
ctime(3).

If the optional

to convert rather than the real time.
