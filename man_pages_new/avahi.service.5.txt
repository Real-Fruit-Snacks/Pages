NAME

avahi.service -
avahi-daemon static service file

SYNOPSIS

/etc/avahi/services/*.service

DESCRIPTION

/etc/avahi/services/*.service
are XML fragments containing static DNS-SD service data.
Every service file can contain multiple service definitions
which share the same name. This is useful for publishing
service data for services which implement multiple
protocols. (i.e. a printer implementing _ipp._tcp and
_printer._tcp)

XML TAGS

The document tag of avahi service files. Should contain 
one  and one or more
 elements. 
 The
service name. If 
replace-wildcards is "yes", any occurence of
the string "%h" will be 
replaced by the local host name. This can be used for
service names 
like "Remote Terminal on %h". If
replace-wildcards is not specified, 
defaults to "no". 

Contains the service information for 
exactly one service type. Should contain one
 and one  
element. Optionally it may contain one
, one ,

any number of  and any number of
 elements. The 
attribute protocol specifies the protocol to
advertise the service on. 
If any is used (which is the default), the service
will be advertised 
on both IPv4 and IPv6. 
 Contains the DNS-SD service type for this
service. e.g. 
"_http._tcp". 
 Contains an additional DNS-SD service
subtype for this 
service. e.g. "_anon._sub._ftp._tcp". 
 The domain name this service should
be registered. If 
omited defaults to the default domain of the avahi daemon.
(probably 
.local) 
 The host name of the host that
provides this service. This 
should be a host that is resolvable by multicast or unicast
DNS. Please 
note that you need to specify a fully-qualified domain name
(FQDN) 
here, i.e. .local is not appended implicitly! The host name
doesn&rsquo;t 
need to be part of the domain specified in
. See 
avahi.hosts(5) for more information how to publish
additional host name 
mappings. 
 The IP port number the service listens on.

DNS-SD TXT 
record data. If value-format is "text", the
value of the TXT record is 
taken verbatim. If value-format is
"binary-hex" then the value of TXT 
record is decoded by taking pairs of characters after the
"=" char and 
interpreting them as the textual representation of the
two-digit 
hexadecimal number. Both uppercase and lowercase hexadecimal
digits are 
allowed. The 0x or 0X prefix is not allowed. This requires
the length 
of the value to be even. If value-format is
"binary-base64" then the 
value of TXT record is decoded with a base64 decoder. The
character set 
used is A-Za-z0-9+/. This requires the length of the value
to be a 
multiple of 4, with "=" as padding at the end. If
value-format is not 
specified, defaults to "text". Examples (all the
values are decoded to 
the string "value" without quotes):

key=value

key=value

key=76616c7565

key=dmFsdWU=
