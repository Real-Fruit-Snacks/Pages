hyphens instead of single hyphen to denote options. You may
use white space in place of the equals sign to separate an
option name from its value.

DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

pamcut
reads a PAM, PBM, PGM, or PPM image as input and extracts
the specified rectangle, and produces the same kind of image
as output.

You can specify
either the rectangle to cut out and keep or specify the
edges to crop off and discard, or a combination.

To request
edges be cropped off, use options -cropleft,
-cropright, -croptop, and -cropbottom
to indicate how many rows or columns to discard.

For example,
-cropleft=50 -cropright=200 means to discard the
leftmost 50 and rightmost 200 columns.

To specify the
rectangle to keep, use -left, -right,
-top, -bottom, -width, -height,
and -pad options.

For example,
-left=50 -right=200 means to keep the 151 columns
between Columns 50 and 200 inclusive.

You can code
any mixture of the options. What you don&rsquo;t specify
defaults. Those defaults are in favor of minimal cutting and
in favor of cutting the right and bottom edges off and (with
-pad) minimal padding and padding on the right and
bottom. It is an error to overspecify, i.e. to specify all
three of -left, -right, and -width or
-top, -bottom, and -height or
right as well as -cropright.

There is an
older way to specify the rectangle to keep: positional
arguments. Arguments were the only way available before July
2000, but you should not use them in new applications.
Options are easier to remember and read, more expressive,
and allow you to use defaults.

If you use both
options and arguments, the two specifications get mixed in
an unspecified way.

To use
arguments, specify all four of the left, top,
width, and height arguments. left and
top have the same effect as specifying them as the
argument of a -left or -top option,
respectively. width and height have the same
effect as specifying them as the argument of a -width
or -height option, respectively, where they are
positive. Where they are not positive, they have the same
effect as specifying one less than the value as the argument
to a -right or -bottom option, respectively.
(E.g. width = 0 makes the cut go all the way to the
right edge). Before July 2000, negative numbers were not
allowed for width and height.

Input is from
Standard Input if you don&rsquo;t specify the input file
pnmfile.

Output is to
Standard Output.

pamcut
works on a multi-image stream. It cuts each image in the
stream independently and produces a multi-image stream
output. Before Netpbm 10.32 (March 2006), it ignored all but
the first image in the stream.

If you are
splitting a single image into multiple same-size images,
pamdice is faster and easier than running
pamcut multiple times.

pamcomp
is also useful for cutting and padding an image to a certain
size. You create a background image of the desired frame
dimensions and overlay the subject image on it.

OPTIONS

In addition to
the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most
notably -quiet, see
 Common Options ),
pamcut recognizes the following command line options:

-left=colnum

The column number of the
leftmost column to be in the output. Columns left of this
get cut out. If a nonnegative number, it refers to columns
numbered from 0 at the left, increasing to the right. If
negative, it refers to columns numbered -1 at the right,
decreasing to the left.

-right=colnum

The column number of the
rightmost column to be in the output, numbered the same as
for -left. Columns to the right of this get cut
out.

-top=rownum

The row number of the topmost
row to be in the output. Rows above this get cut out. If a
nonnegative number it refers to rows numbered from 0 at the
top, increasing downward. If negative, it refers to columns
numbered -1 at the bottom, decreasing upward.

-bottom=rownum

The row number of the
bottom-most row to be in the output, numbered the same as
for -top. Rows below this get cut out.

-width=cols

The number of columns to be in
the output. Must be positive.

-height=rows

The number of rows to be in the
output. Must be positive.

-cropleft 
-cropright 
-croptop 
-cropbottom

These options tell how many
rows or columns to crop from the left, right, top, or bottom
edges, respectively.

The value must
not be negative.

These option
were new in Netpbm 10.85 (December 2018). Before that, you
can achieve the same thing with -left, top,
and negative values for -right and -bottom.
Remember to subtract one in the latter case; e.g. the
equivalent of -cropright=1 is -right=-2.

-pad

If the rectangle you specify is not entirely within the
input image, pamcut fails unless you also specify
-pad. In that case, it pads the output with black up
to the edges you specify. You can use this option if you
need to have an image of certain dimensions and have an
image of arbitrary dimensions.

pnmpad
also adds borders to an image, but you specify their width
directly.

pamcomp
does a more general form of this padding. Create a
background image of the frame dimensions and overlay the
subject image on it. You can use options to have the subject
image in the center of the frame or against any edge and
make the padding any color (the padding color is the color
of the background image).

-reportonly

This causes pamcut to
write to Standard Output a description of the 
cutting it would have done instead of producing an output
image. See 
below for a description of this
output and ways 
to use it.

That
description is one line of text, containing 8 decimal
numbers of 
pixels, separated by spaces:

&bull;

column number of left cut

&bull;

column number of right cut

&bull;

row number of top cut

&bull;

row number of bottom cut

&bull;

width of input image

&bull;

height of input image

&bull;

width of output image

&bull;

height of output image

The column
number of the left cut is the column number in the input
image of the leftmost column of the output image. for the
right cut, it is for the rightmost column of the output. Top
and bottom are analogous.

The column
and row numbers can be negative if you specified
-pad and pamcut would have added padding.
Likewise, they can be beyond the right and bottom edge of
the input image.

Example:

10 109 -1 98
150 80 100 100

This option was
new in Netpbm 11.06 (March 2024).

-verbose

Print information about the
processing to Standard Error.

HISTORY

pamcut
was derived from pnmcut in Netpbm 9.20 (May 2001). It
was the first Netpbm program adapted to the new PAM format
and programming library.

The predecessor
pnmcut was one of the oldest tools in the Netpbm
package.
