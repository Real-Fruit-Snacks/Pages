NAME

pbmtopsg3 -
convert PBM images to Postscript with G3 fax compression

SYNOPSIS

pbmtopsg3
[--title=title] [--dpi=dpi]
[filespec]

DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

pbmtopsg3
converts the PBM images in the input PBM file to pages in a
Postscript file encoded with G3 fax compression.

pnmtops
is a more general program for converting from the Netpbm
formats to Postscript, though it cannot produce the
particular subformat that pbmtopsg3 does.

If you
don&rsquo;t specify filespec, the input is from
Standard Input.

Remember that
you can create a multi-image PBM file simply by
concatenating single-image PBM files, so if each page is in
a different file, you might do:

cat faxpage* |
pbmtopsg3 >fax.ps

OPTIONS

In addition to
the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most
notably -quiet, see
 Common Options ),
pbmtopsg3 recognizes the following command line
options:

-title

The Postscript title value. Default is no title.

-dpi

The resolution of the Postscript output. Default is 72
dpi.
