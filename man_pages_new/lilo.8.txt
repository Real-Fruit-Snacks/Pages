DESCRIPTION

lilo installs a
boot loader that will be activated the next time you boot
your system. The default configuration file
/etc/lilo.conf (see manpage lilo.conf(5)) will
contain most options, but many, including those which
override the configuration file, may be specified on the
command line.

OPTIONS

-A
master-device [N]

Used with a single argument,
inquire of active partition on device master-device;
e.g. /dev/sda. With N==0: deactivate all partitions
on the device. With N in the range [1..n]: activate the
specified partition and deactivate all others. Normally,
only primary partitions [1..4] may be activated, but if the
&rsquo;Extended Master Boot Loader&rsquo; is present on the
Master Boot Record ( MBR ) of the device (see
the -M option), any partition may be made active. Whether
the actual OS in the partition will boot from
a logical partition depends on the characteristics of the
OS. LILO boot records for Linux may be booted
from a logical partition.

-b bootdev

Set the boot device where the
boot loader will be installed. For example "-b
/dev/sda" set the Master Boot Record (
MBR ) on the first disk as boot device.
"-b /dev/sdb5" set the first logical
partition on the second disk as boot device.

-B
bitmap-file

Define a bitmap file for the
boot-time graphics screen, preferably one already
pre-processed with the -E option.

-c

Enable map compaction. This will merge read requests
from adjacent sectors. Speeds up the booting especially from
floppy. 

-C
config-file

Set another pathname and
filename for the configuration file. The default
configuration file is /etc/lilo.conf.

-d delay-time

Set the delay time in tenths of
a second (&rsquo;20&rsquo; = 2 sec) before automatically
booting the first image. This give you time to interrupt the
automatic boot process with: Shift, Alt, Ctrl, ScrollLock,
or CapsLock. If interrupted, the boot: prompt will be
displayed.

This switch
will be overridden by the appearance of prompt in the
configuration file!

-D label

Use the kernel with the given
label as the default kernel to boot, instead of the first
one in the list of the configuration file.

-E
filename.xxx

If the extension .xxx is
.bmp, then take the file to be a bitmap graphic file
for use in the bitmap= configuration file directive.
Enter an interactive editor to create or update the
color/placement information in the LILO
header of this bitmap file. (see bmp-colors,
bmp-table, and bmp-timer on the manual page
for lilo.conf (5).)

If .xxx
is .dat then take this file to be a configuration
file to set bitmap graphic parameters, which are transferred
into the LILO header in the bitmap file of
the same name.

When a
.bmp file is modified using a graphics editor (e.g.
GIMP ), the LILO header will
be lost. It can be restored using the dat file, which
is used as a text-based backup for the LILO
header information.

-f disk-tab

Set another disk geometry
parameter file. The default is /etc/disktab.

-F

Override boot sector check for filesystems (e.g., swap,
ext4, xfs ...) which might be destroyed by the installation
of the LILO boot sector on the first sector
of the partition if these filesystems use the first sector
as a superblock.

Compare with
-P ignore, which bypasses certain partition table
checks.

-g

Generate
&rsquo;cylinder/head/sector&rsquo; ( CHS
geometric) disk addresses. Limited to cylinders up to 1023.
Forces compatibility with very old versions of
LILO (obsolete switch).

-H

Override fatal halt if a RAID array does
not have all disks active.

-I label
[D|a|i|k|r|R]

label is taken to be the
name of an image specified in the configuration file. This
command will print the path name of the corresponding kernel
file, keytable file, initial ramdisk file, root
specification, or "append=" string ("i",
"k", "r", "R", or
"a" option). The "D" option ignores the
label parameter and prints the default
"image=" label, or the first "image="
label is selected if no default image is set.

-l

Generate 24-bit linear sector addresses instead of
cylinder/head/sector addresses.

-L

Generate 32-bit Logical Block Addresses (
LBA ) instead of cylinder/head/sector (
CHS ) addresses, allowing access to all
partitions on disks with more than 1024 cylinders. (This is
the default geometry).

-m map-file

Use another map file instead of
the default file /boot/map.

-M master-device
{mbr|ext}

Install a Master Boot Record on
the device specified as master-device, selecting the
Standard or Extended Master Boot Loader per option. The
primary partition table on master-device is undisturbed. If
no valid Volume-ID (serial number) is present, then generate
one and write it to the MBR. If mbr is
set, the Standard Master Boot Loader will search partitions
1-4 for an active flag, and boot the flagged partition. Only
one active flag is allowed. If ext is set, the search
for an active partition will include logical partitions as
well. The presence of the Extended Master Boot Loader on the
Master Boot Record ( MBR = sector 0) of a
disk affects the operation of the -A option.

-p

Require interactive entry of all passwords set as
"" in the configuration file.

-P
{fix|ignore|}>

Fix or ignore
&rsquo;corrupt&rsquo; partition tables, e.g. partition
tables with linear and cylinder/head/sector addresses that
do not correspond. Always try ignore first, as
fix will re-write the partition table, possibly
destroying all partitions on the disk.

ignore
is also used to bypass the partition table check for
partition types within the partition table which might not
allow the installation of a LILO boot sector.
Compare with the &rsquo;-F&rsquo; flag, which overrides the
check of the actual boot sector.

allows the passing of any global option which may appear in
the global section (top) of the configuration file
(/etc/lilo.conf). For instance &rsquo;-P
nowarn&rsquo; will pass the &rsquo;nowarn&rsquo; option,
just as though &rsquo;nowarn&rsquo; appeared in the
configuration file (same as the &rsquo;-w&rsquo; switch).
Similarly &rsquo;-P timeout=50&rsquo; will add or
override the &rsquo;timeout=&rsquo; line in the
configuration file. Note that the general -P switch
actually duplicates a number of command line option
switches. However, it is not strictly the same as some
switches which cause an override of other options; e.g.
&rsquo;-g&rsquo; (-P geometric), &rsquo;-L&rsquo; (-P
lba32).

-q

List the currently mapped files. lilo maintains a
file, by default /boot/map, containing each name and
location of the kernel(s) to boot. This option will list the
names therein. Use with -v for more detailed
information about the installed boot loader.

-r
root-directory

Before doing anything else, do
a &rsquo;chroot&rsquo; to the indicated directory.
The new root directory must contain a /dev directory
and may need a /boot directory. It may also need an
/etc/lilo.conf file.

-R
command-line

This option sets the default
command for the boot loader for the next time it executes.
After execution the boot loader will erase this line because
it is a once-only command. It is typically used in reboot
scripts, just before calling &rsquo;shutdown -r&rsquo;. Used
without any arguments, it will cancel a lock-ed or
fallback command line.

This Command
line starts with image identifier (as shown during map file
update), then space, then kernel parameters. The kernel
parameters are appended to kernel command line constructed
routinely. In either case, it there were parameters or not,
such one-time command will be treated by loaders code, as if
it is set at &rsquo;boot:&rsquo; prompt. This could lead to
&rsquo;password:&rsquo; prompt at boot time. Be warned!
Refer to lilo.conf(5) for details.

-s save-file

When lilo writes a new boot
sector, it preserves the former contents of the boot sector
in a file, named by default /boot/boot.NNNN, where
NNNN is the hexadecimal representation of the
major and minor device numbers of the drive/partition.

This option
defines the backup save file in one of three ways: a save
directory (default is &rsquo;/boot&rsquo;) using the default
filename &rsquo;boot.NNNN&rsquo; in the defined directory; a
pathname template to which &rsquo;.NNNN&rsquo; is appended
(default would be &rsquo;/boot/boot&rsquo;); or the full
pathname of the file, which must include the correct
&rsquo;.NNNN&rsquo; suffix. When used with the -u option,
the full file pathname must be set.

-S save-file

Normally lilo will not
overwrite an existing boot sector save file. This options
says that overwriting is to be forced. As with -s, the
setting may be of a save directory, pathname template, or
full pathname (which includes the &rsquo;.NNNN&rsquo;
suffix).

-t

Test only. Do not really write a new boot sector or map
file. Use together with -v to find out what lilo is
about to do.

-T option

Print out system information,
some of it extracted from system bios. This is more
convenient than booting the LILO diagnostic
floppy on problem systems. option may be any one of
the following:

 help          print a list of available diagnostics
 ChRul         list the partition types subject to
                 Change-Rules
 EBDA          list Extended BIOS Data Area information
 geom=  list drive geometry for bios drive;
                 e.g. geom=0x80
 geom          list drive geometry for all drives
 table= list the primary partition table;
                 e.g. table=/dev/sda
 video         list graphic modes available to boot
                 loader

-u
[device-name]

Uninstall lilo by copying the
saved boot sector back. The -s and -C switches
may be used with this option. The device-name is optional. A
time-stamp is checked.

-U
[device-name]

The same as &rsquo;-u&rsquo;,
but do not check the time-stamp.

-v [number]

Increase verbosity. Giving one
to five -v options will make lilo more verbose. The
number (range 1..5) set verbosity level.

-V

Print version number.

-w[+|-]

Used as -w or -w-
to suppress warning messages. Used as &rsquo;-w+&rsquo; to
override &rsquo;nowarn&rsquo; in the configuration
file and show warning messages.

-x option

For RAID
installations only. The option may be any of the keywords:
none, auto, mbr, mbr-only, or a
comma separated list of additional boot devices (no spaces
allowed in the list).

RAID
installations write the boot record to the
RAID partition. Conditional writing of MBRs
may occur to aid in making the RAID set
bootable in a recovery situation, but all default actions
may be overridden. Action similar to previous versions is
achieved using the &rsquo;-x mbr-only&rsquo;
switch.

-X

Reserved for LILO internal use. May
produce different output for different LILO
versions. The line beginning "CFLAGS=" will
contain the compiler options used to generate this version
of LILO.

-z

When used with the &rsquo;-M&rsquo; switch, clears the
Volume-ID. Usually used in the following sequence to
generate a new Volume-ID:

    lilo -z -M /dev/sda
    lilo -M /dev/sda

-Z option

Tells the boot installer
whether special precautions need to be taken because the
BIOS fails to pass the correct device code in
DL (-Z0). Or may specify that the
BIOS always gets DL right
(-Z1). Corresponds to, and overrides, the configuration file
option &rsquo;bios-passes-dl=&rsquo;.

CONFIG OPTIONS

The above
command line options correspond to the key words in the
config file indicated below.

              -b bootdev       boot=bootdev
              -B file.bmp      bitmap=file.bmp
              -c               compact
              -d dsec          delay=dsec
              -D label         default=label
              -f file          disktab=file
              -g               geometric
              -l               linear
              -L               lba32
              -m mapfile       map=mapfile
              -P fix           fix-table
              -P ignore        ignore-table
              -s file          backup=file
              -S file          force-backup=file
              -v [N]           verbose=N
              -w               nowarn
              -x option        raid-extra-boot=option
              -Z option        bios-passes-dl=option

BOOT OPTIONS

The options
described here may be specified at boot time on the command
line when a kernel image is booted. These options are
processed by LILO, and are removed from the
command line before it is passed to the kernel, unless
otherwise noted. 
lock

Locks the command line, as
though &rsquo;lock&rsquo; had been defined in
/etc/lilo.conf.

mem=###[,K,M,G]

Set the maximum memory in the
system in bytes, kilobytes, megabytes or gigabytes. This
option is not removed from the command line, and is always
passed to the kernel.

nobd

Suppresses the
BIOS data check. This option is reserved for
use with non-IBM-compliant BIOS &rsquo;s
which hang with the lines:

    Loading...............
    BIOS data check

vga=[
ASK,EXT,EXTENDED,NORMAL ,###,0x###]

Allows overriding the default
video mode upon kernel startup.

BOOT ERRORS

The boot
process takes place in two stages. The first stage loader is
a single sector, and is loaded by the BIOS or
by the loader in the MBR. It loads the
multi-sector second stage loader, but is very space limited.
When the first stage loader gets control, it types the
letter &rsquo;L&rsquo;; when it is ready to transfer control
to the second stage loader it types the letter
&rsquo;I&rsquo;. If any error occurs, like a disk read
error, it will put out a hexadecimal error code and then
re-try the operation. All hex error codes are
BIOS return values, except for the
lilo-generated codes: 40, 99 and 9A. A partial list of error
codes follows:

    00  no error
    01  invalid disk command
    02  address mark not found
    03  disk write-protected
    04  sector not found
    06  floppy disk removed
    08  DMA overrun
    0A  bad sector flag
    0B  bad track flag
    20  controller failure
    40  seek failure (BIOS)
    40  cylinder>1023 (LILO)
    99  invalid second stage index sector (LILO)
    9A  no second stage loader signature (LILO)
    AA  drive not ready
    FF  sense operation failed

Error code 40
is generated by the BIOS, or by
LILO during the conversion of a linear
(24-bit) disk address to a geometric (C:H:S) address. On
older systems which do not support lba32 (32-bit)
addressing, this error may also be generated. Errors 99 and
9A usually mean the map file (&rsquo;-m&rsquo; or
&rsquo;map=&rsquo;) is not readable, likely because
LILO was not re-run after some system change,
or there is a geometry mismatch between what
LILO used (lilo -v3 to display) and what is
actually being used by the BIOS (one of the
lilo diagnostic disks, available in the source distribution,
may be needed to diagnose this problem).

When the second
stage loader has received control from the first stage, it
prints the letter &rsquo;L&rsquo;, and when it has
initialized itself, including verifying the "Descriptor
Table" - the list of kernels/others to boot - it will
print the letter "O", to form the full word "
LILO", in uppercase.

All second
stage loader error messages are English text and try to
pinpoint, more or less successfully, the point of
failure.

BUGS

Configuration
file options &rsquo;backup&rsquo; and
&rsquo;force-backup&rsquo; should specify a backup directory
or backup file pathname template on all RAID
installations. Use of an explicit filename may not allow
multiple backup files to be created correctly. It is best to
use the default mechanism, as it works correctly in all
cases.
