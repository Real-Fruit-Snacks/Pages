pthread_equal -
compare thread IDs

SYNOPSIS

#include

t2);

DESCRIPTION

The
pthread_equal() function compares two thread
identifiers.

thread IDs are equal, pthread_equal() returns a
nonzero value; otherwise, it returns 0.

always succeeds.

explanation of the terms used in this section, see
attributes(7).

CONFORMING TO

POSIX.1-2001,
POSIX.1-2008.

NOTES

The
pthread_equal() function is necessary because thread
IDs should be considered opaque: there is no portable way
for applications to directly compare two pthread_t
values.
