DESCRIPTION

adduser
and addgroup add users and groups to the system
according to command line options and configuration
information in /etc/adduser.conf. They are friendlier
front ends to the low level tools like useradd,
groupadd and usermod programs, by default
choosing Debian policy conformant UID and GID values,
creating a home directory with skeletal configuration,
running a custom script, and other features. adduser
and addgroup can be run in one of five modes:

Add a normal
user 
If called with one non-option argument and without the
&minus;&minus;system or &minus;&minus;group
options, adduser will add a normal user.

adduser
will choose the first available UID from the range specified
for normal users in the configuration file. The UID can be
overridden with the &minus;&minus;uid option.

The range
specified in the configuration file may be overridden with
the &minus;&minus;firstuid and
&minus;&minus;lastuid options.

By default,
each user in Debian GNU/Linux is given a corresponding group
with the same name. Usergroups allow group writable
directories to be easily maintained by placing the
appropriate users in the new group, setting the set-group-ID
bit in the directory, and ensuring that all users use a
umask of 002. If this option is turned off by setting
USERGROUPS to no, all users&rsquo; GIDs are
set to USERS_GID. Users&rsquo; primary groups can
also be overridden from the command line with the
&minus;&minus;gid or &minus;&minus;ingroup
options to set the group by id or name, respectively. Also,
users can be added to one or more groups defined in
adduser.conf either by setting ADD_EXTRA_GROUPS to 1 in
adduser.conf, or by passing
&minus;&minus;add_extra_groups on the
commandline.

adduser
will create a home directory subject to DHOME,
GROUPHOMES, and LETTERHOMES. The home
directory can be overridden from the command line with the
&minus;&minus;home option, and the shell with the
&minus;&minus;shell option. The home
directory&rsquo;s set-group-ID bit is set if
USERGROUPS is yes so that any files created in
the user&rsquo;s home directory will have the correct
group.

adduser
will copy files from SKEL into the home directory and
prompt for finger (gecos) information and a password. The
gecos may also be set with the &minus;&minus;gecos
option. With the &minus;&minus;disabled-login option,
the account will be created but will be disabled until a
password is set. The &minus;&minus;disabled-password
option will not set a password, but login is still possible
(for example with SSH RSA keys).

If the file
/usr/local/sbin/adduser.local exists, it will be
executed after the user account has been set up in order to
do any local setup. The arguments passed to
adduser.local are: 
username uid gid home-directory 
The environment variable VERBOSE is set according to the
following rule:

0 if

&minus;&minus;quiet is specified

1 if neither

&minus;&minus;quiet nor
&minus;&minus;debug is specified

2 if

&minus;&minus;debug is specified

(The same
applies to the variable DEBUG, but DEBUG is deprecated and
will be removed in a later version of adduser.)

Add a system
user 
If called with one non-option argument and the
&minus;&minus;system option, adduser will add
a system user. If a user with the same name already exists
in the system uid range (or, if the uid is specified, if a
user with that uid already exists), adduser will exit with a
warning. This warning can be suppressed by adding
&minus;&minus;quiet.

adduser
will choose the first available UID from the range specified
for system users in the configuration file (FIRST_SYSTEM_UID
and LAST_SYSTEM_UID). If you want to have a specific UID,
you can specify it using the &minus;&minus;uid
option.

By default,
system users are placed in the nogroup group. To
place the new system user in an already existing group, use
the &minus;&minus;gid or &minus;&minus;ingroup
options. To place the new system user in a new group with
the same ID, use the &minus;&minus;group option.

A home
directory is created by the same rules as for normal users.
The new system user will have the shell
/usr/sbin/nologin (unless overridden with the
&minus;&minus;shell option), and have logins
disabled. Skeletal configuration files are not copied.

Add a user
group 
If adduser is called with the
&minus;&minus;group option and without the
&minus;&minus;system option, or addgroup is
called respectively, a user group will be added.

A GID will be
chosen from the range specified for system GIDS in the
configuration file (FIRST_GID, LAST_GID). To override that
mechanism you can give the GID using the
&minus;&minus;gid option.

The group is
created with no users.

Add a system
group 
If addgroup is called with the
&minus;&minus;system option, a system group will be
added.

A GID will be
chosen from the range specified for system GIDS in the
configuration file (FIRST_SYSTEM_GID, LAST_SYSTEM_GID). To
override that mechanism you can give the GID using the
&minus;&minus;gid option.

The group is
created with no users.

Add an
existing user to an existing group 
If called with two non-option arguments, adduser will
add an existing user to an existing group.

OPTIONS

&minus;&minus;conf
FILE

Use FILE instead of
/etc/adduser.conf.

&minus;&minus;disabled-login

Do not run passwd to set the
password. The user won&rsquo;t be able to use her account
until the password is set.

&minus;&minus;disabled-password

Like
&minus;&minus;disabled-login, but logins are still possible
(for example using SSH RSA keys) but not using password
authentication.

&minus;&minus;force&minus;badname

By default, user and group
names are checked against the configurable regular
expression NAME_REGEX specified in the configuration
file. This option forces adduser and addgroup
to apply only a weak check for validity of the name.
NAME_REGEX is described in
adduser.conf(5).

&minus;&minus;gecos
GECOS

Set the gecos field for the new
entry generated. adduser will not ask for finger
information if this option is given.

&minus;&minus;gid ID

When creating a group, this
option forces the new groupid to be the given number. When
creating a user, this option will put the user in that
group.

&minus;&minus;group

When combined with
&minus;&minus;system, a group with the same name and
ID as the system user is created. If not combined with
&minus;&minus;system, a group with the given name is
created. This is the default action if the program is
invoked as addgroup.

&minus;&minus;help

Display brief instructions.

&minus;&minus;home
DIR

Use DIR as the user&rsquo;s
home directory, rather than the default specified by the
configuration file. If the directory does not exist, it is
created and skeleton files are copied.

&minus;&minus;shell
SHELL

Use SHELL as the user&rsquo;s
login shell, rather than the default specified by the
configuration file.

&minus;&minus;ingroup
GROUP

Add the new user to GROUP
instead of a usergroup or the default group defined by
USERS_GID in the configuration file. This affects the
users primary group. To add additional groups, see the
add_extra_groups option.

&minus;&minus;no-create-home

Do not create the home
directory, even if it doesn&rsquo;t exist.

&minus;&minus;quiet

Suppress informational
messages, only show warnings and errors.

&minus;&minus;debug

Be verbose, most useful if you
want to nail down a problem with adduser.

&minus;&minus;system

Create a system user or
group.

&minus;&minus;uid ID

Force the new userid to be the
given number. adduser will fail if the userid is
already taken.

&minus;&minus;firstuid
ID

Override the first uid in the
range that the uid is chosen from (overrides
FIRST_UID specified in the configuration file).

&minus;&minus;lastuid
ID

Override the last uid in the
range that the uid is chosen from ( LAST_UID )

&minus;&minus;add_extra_groups

Add new user to extra groups
defined in the configuration file.

&minus;&minus;version

Display version and copyright
information.

EXIT VALUES

0

The user exists as specified.
This can have 2 causes: The user was created by adduser or
the user was already present on the system before adduser
was invoked. If adduser was returning 0 , invoking adduser a
second time with the same parameters as before also returns
0. 

1

Creating the user or group failed because it was already
present with other UID/GID than specified. The username or
groupname was rejected because of a mismatch with the
configured regular expressions, see adduser.conf(5). Adduser
has been aborted by a signal.

Or for many other yet
undocumented reasons which are printed to console then. You
may then consider to remove &minus;&minus;quiet to
make adduser more verbose.

FILES

/etc/adduser.conf
