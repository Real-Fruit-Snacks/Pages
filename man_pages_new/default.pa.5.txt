NAME

default.pa -
PulseAudio Sound Server Startup Script

SYNOPSIS

~/.config/pulse/default.pa

/etc/pulse/default.pa

/etc/pulse/system.pa

DESCRIPTION

The PulseAudio
sound server interprets a configuration script on startup,
which is mainly used to define the set of modules to load.
When PulseAudio runs in the per-user mode and
~/.config/pulse/default.pa exists, that file is used.
When PulseAudio runs in the per-user mode and that file
doesn&rsquo;t exist, /etc/pulse/default.pa is used.
When PulseAudio runs as a system service,
/etc/pulse/system.pa is used.

The script
should contain directives in the PulseAudio CLI language, as
documented in pulse-cli-syntax(5).
