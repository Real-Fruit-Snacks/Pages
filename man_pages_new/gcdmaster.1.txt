NAME

gcdmaster
&minus; Graphical front end to cdrdao for composing audio
CDs

SYNOPSIS

gcdmaster
[toc-file]

DESCRIPTION

gcdmaster
allows the creation of toc-files for cdrdao and can control
the recording process. Its main application is the
composition of audio CDs from one or more audio files. It
supports PQ-channel editing, entry of meta data like ISRC
codes/CD-TEXT and non destructive cut of the audio data.

If a
toc-file is specified it will be read and the
referenced audio data will be displayed. It is also possible
to specify a ".cue" file.

The GUI
periodically polls all configured CD-ROM and CD-recorder
devices (see section DEVICE CONFIGURE DIALOG) to retrieve
their status (ready, busy, no disk). This is done by sending
a TEST UNIT READY command to the devices. Following problems
may arise:

o

Some devices (e.g. the Philips CDD2600) block the SCSI
bus when a TEST UNIT READY is issued while it logs in a new
medium. This will cause a buffer under run for all currently
recording devices that are connected to the same bus.

o

The GUI cannot detect if a device is used by another
program. It will continue to poll the device which may
disturb the operation of the other program.

The GUI
supports recording of the same or different projects on
multiple devices in parallel. However, there are some
caveats and your system must meat some prerequisites:

o

Under Linux a kernel version
>= 2.2.6 should be used. The generic SCSI device of older
kernels does not support parallel access to multiple
devices. 

o

The bandwidths of the disks that contain the source data
and the involved busses must be big enough to serve all
recorder devices.

o

Some recorder devices may block the SCSI bus when the
disk is ejected by the software after the burning process
(e.g. the Plextor PX-R412). For this reason a warning
message will be displayed if the "Eject" button is
checked in the "Record" dialog. Manually ejecting
a disk seems not to be a problem.

o

ATAPI devices supported by the &rsquo;generic-mmc&rsquo;
driver will block the IDE bus while writing the lead-in and
lead-out. Thus parallel writing with such devices connected
to the same IDE channel will not work. There is a way to
avoid this blocking with some ATAPI devices but it is not
implemented, yet.

CONCEPTS

The main idea
of this GUI is to maintain a continuous stream of audio data
that can be composed of several audio files. It is possible
to use only portions of audio files in the audio stream
which is the basic idea for the non destructive cut
capability.

For example, if
you cut out some samples in the middle of an audio file the
result will be a portion that starts at the beginning of the
audio file and ends at the beginning of the cut region and a
second portion that starts at the end of the cut region and
reaches until the end of the audio file. Of course, all of
this is hidden by the GUI and you will just see the
result.

Track and index
marks are placed relatively to the continuous audio stream.
It is not necessary to have a separate audio file for each
track. Track/index marks can be set, moved and deleted
without influencing the audio data stream.

Sample
Marker 
A sample marker serves as an insertion position for audio
data. It is equivalent to the cursor of a text editor. All
functions that insert audio data require a defined marker.
At most one sample marker may be active at any time.

Sample
Selection 
A sample selection specifies a continuous range of audio
samples. At most one sample selection may be active at any
time.

Track
Mark 
A track mark specifies a point in the audio stream where the
track number or the index number changes. Track marks are
written as a pair of two numbers like 5.1 for track 5, index
1. Track numbers may be in the range 1..99, the valid range
for index numbers is 0..99. Index 0 represents the pre-gap
of a track where the track relative time counts backwards
down to zero. Index 1 marks the real start of the track.
This position is stored in the central toc of the CD and is
used by CD players to directly jump to a track. All index
numbers > 2 may be used to subdivide a track but have no
further effect. Some CD players may jump to such index
marks.

Track marks may
be selected to show data about a track or to perform
operations on the complete track. At most one track mark may
be selected at any time.

Times

The time is usually displayed as m:s:f.x where m represents
minutes, s represents seconds (0..59), f represents frames
(0..74, 1/75 second) and x stands for samples (0..587,
1/44100 second).

MAIN WINDOW

The main window
consists of a menu bar, a sample display, a marker/selection
line, a button line and a status line.

The title of
the main window shows the current toc-file name. A
"(*)" behind the name indicates that changes have
not been saved.

Menu Bar

The functions that are accessible via the menu bar are
described in section MENU FUNCTIONS.

Sample
Display 
The sample display provides a visual representation of the
audio stream and the placed track/index markers.

The samples are
displayed as two separate graphs for the left and right
channel where the x-axis represents the time and the y-axis
denotes the amplitude (linearly scaled). If a pixel
represents more than 1 sample the maximum and minimum
amplitude of all samples that fall within this pixel is
displayed. It is possible to zoom in and out and change the
displayed portion with the scroll bar.

The track/index
markers are shown on top of the two graphs. Track marks with
index 1 are represented by filled track symbol. All other
track marks use a hollow track symbol. The track/index
number pair is displayed on the right side of a track
symbol.

Track marks can
be selected or moved by clicking or dragging with the mouse
pointer located over a track symbol. The track/index number
pairs are not sensitive.

Marker/Selection
Line 
This line shows the actual cursor and active marker position
and the active sample selection.

The cursor
field is read-only and shows the time value of the actual
mouse pointer position within the audio stream if it is
located inside the sample display. During playback the
cursor field shows the time value of currently audible
sound.

The marker
field shows the time value of the active marker. A time
value may be entered and hitting the return key sets the new
marker position if the time value is valid.

The sample
selection fields show the active selected sample range. Time
values may be entered and hitting the return key in one of
these fields sets the new sample selection if the time
values are valid.

Button
Line 
The zoom/select radio buttons specify the behavior when
dragging with the mouse in the sample display. If
"zoom" is active the sample display will zoom to
selected sample range. If "select" is active the
active sample selection will be set to the selected sample
range.

The play button
will playback the currently active sample selection via the
sound card. If no sample selection is active the currently
displayed sample range will be used. While playing the
current project is set to read-only state and all operations
that would modify the project are disabled.

Status
Line 
The status line shows more information about the last
executed action or an error message if an action could not
be executed.

MENU FUNCTIONS

File->New

Starts a new project. If the current work is not saved a
confirmation box will be opened.

File->Open

Opens a file selector box to select a toc-file or a .cue
file that should be read. If the current work is not saved a
confirmation box will pop up.

File->Save

Saves current work as a toc-file with the current file
name.

File->Save
As 
Opens a file sector box to select a toc-file to which the
current work is saved.

File->Quit

Quits gcdmaster. If the current work is not saved a
confirmation box will pop up.

View->Zoom
To Selection 
Zooms the sample display to the currently active sample
selection. If no sample selection is active nothing will
happen.

View->Zoom
out 
Doubles the range of displayed samples.

View->Fullview

Shows all samples of the audio stream in the sample
display.

Edit->Cut

Removes the active selected sample range from the audio
stream. The audio file on the disk will not be touched by
this operation. The sample marker will be set so that a
following "Paste" operation will revert the effect
of this operation.

If no sample
selection is active nothing will happen.

Edit->Paste

Pastes the samples that were previously removed with
"Cut" at the current sample marker position. The
sample selection is set to the pasted samples so that a
following "Cut" operation will revert the effect
of this operation.

If no sample
marker is set nothing will happen.

Edit->Add
Track Mark 
Adds a track mark with index 1 at the active sample marker
position. The position will be rounded to the next frame
boundary. If the previous or the new track would be shorter
than 4 seconds no track mask is created.

If no sample
marker is active nothing will happen.

Edit->Add
Index Mark 
Adds a track mark with index > 1 at the active sample
marker position. The position will be rounded to the next
frame boundary. Index marks cannot be created in the pre-gap
area of a track.

If no sample
marker is active nothing will happen.

Edit->Add
Pre-Gap 
Adds a track mark with index 0 (pre-gap) at the active
sample marker position. Index 0 can only be added right
before a track mark with index 1. If the length of the
previous track would be shorter than 4 seconds after
inserting the pre-gap this operation is not performed.

If no sample
marker is active nothing will happen.

Edit->Remove
Track Mark 
Removes selected track mark with any index. If a track mark
with index 1 is removed all track marks of this track will
be removed.

If no track
marker is selected nothing will happen.

DISK INFO DIALOG (Tools->Disk Info)

This non modal
dialog shows summary information about the whole project and
allows editing of meta data that is valid for the complete
disk.

The
"Apply" button must be used to make changes
permanent. If the summary information changes before the
"Apply" button was hit, e.g. by adding a new
track, all changes will be lost.

The
"Cancel" button withdraws all changes and closes
the dialog box.

Summary
Frame 
Shows the total number of tracks, i.e. number of track marks
with index 1, and the total length of the audio stream.

Sub-Channel
Frame 
Allows entry and editing of data that is written to the
sub-channels of a disk. The scope of this data covers the
whole disk.

The "Toc
Type" option menu can be used to select the type of the
table of contents that will be written to the disk.
Currently, for projects that are solely created with this
GUI only the type "CD-DA" or "CD-ROM-XA"
makes sense. If you read a toc-file that contains data track
specifications another type may be displayed.

The
"UPC/EAN" edit field sets the catalog number of
the disk. Exactly 13 digits must be entered to set the
catalog number. To clear the catalog number the edit field
must be completely cleared.

CD-TEXT
Frame 
CD-TEXT data can be specified for up to 8 different
languages. Each language is reference by a language number
0..7. The first language should have language number 0.
Language numbers should be used continuously.

The actual
language for a language number is specified with the
"Language" option menu: The option
"Unknown" is shown for an unknown language code
(e.g. if the toc-file was edited manually). It is not
possible to select this option. Option "Undefined"
means that no language was assigned for this language
number. It is possible to enter CD-TEXT data and the entered
data will be saved to the toc-file but it will not be
recorded to a CD-R/CD-RW. The remaining options select the
desired language. Each language can be assigned only to one
language number.

The remaining
CD-TEXT fields contain ASCII data. It is not necessary to
use them all but at least "Title" and
"Performer" should be filled.

TRACK INFO DIALOG (Tools->Track Info)

This non modal
dialog shows information about a selected track and allows
editing of track specific meta data. If no track mark is
selected all fields will be cleared and set insensitive.

The
"Apply" button must be used to make changes
permanent. If the track information changes, e.g. by adding
a index mark, or another track mark is selected before the
"Apply" button was hit all changes will be
lost.

The
"Cancel" button withdraws all changes and closes
the dialog box.

Summary
Frame 
Shows the length of the pre-gap (0 if no pre-gap is
defined), the absolute start and end time, the track length
excluding the pre-gap length and the number of index marks
> 1.

Sub-Channel
Frame 
Allows editing of all data that is written to the Q
sub-channels of the track:

Copy:

Digital copy permitted when
selected. 

Pre Emphasis:

Audio data of track has pre
emphasis when selected.

Two/Four Channel Audio:

Select "Four Channel
Audio" if the audio data encodes more than two
channels. Of course, only two real channels will be recorded
on a CD-R/CD-RW in any case.

ISRC:

Allows to edit the ISRC code of the track. The first
fields holds the country code; it will only accept capital
letters. The second field holds the owner code, capital
letters and digits are allowed. The remaining fields holds
the year and a serial number and will only accept digits.
All fields must be filled to set the ISRC code and all
fields must be cleared to remove it.

CD-TEXT
Frame 
Allows to enter and edit the CD-TEXT data of each language
number for this track. All fields are optional but at least
"Title" and "Performer" should be
filled.

DEVICE CONFIGURE DIALOG (Settings->Devices)

This non modal
dialog shows the settings of all attached SCSI or ATAPI
devices that identify themselves as CD-ROM or WORM
device.

All device
settings that differ from the default settings will be
permanently stored in the $HOME/.gnome/GnomeCDMaster
configuration file.

The
"Apply" button must be used to make all changes
permanent. The "Reset" button reverts all changes
since the last apply or the dialog box was opened. The
"Cancel" button withdraws all changes and closes
the dialog box.

Devices
Frame 
The browser shows the SCSI address (bus,id,lun) and the
vendor/model string of all available devices. If devices are
not automatically detected it is possible to add devices
manually to the browser (see "Add Device"
Frame).

The
"Status" column shows the actual device
status:

Ready:

Device has a disk loaded and is
ready for an action.

Busy:

Device is active with an unspecified action.

Recording:

Device is recording.

No disk:

Device has no disk loaded.

Not available:

Device cannot be accessed.

The
"Rescan" button can be used to start the automatic
drive detection process. All changes will be lost and the
newly detected devices take immediate effect without hitting
"Apply".

The
"Delete" button removes the selected device. The
change takes immediate effect and all other changes will be
lost.

Device
Settings Frame 
This frame allows to edit the settings of the currently
selected device. 
Device Type:

This option menu defines the
device type which is used to control which actions can be
performed with this device: CD-ROM: read only device, CD-R:
CD-R recorder device, CD-RW: CD-RW/CD-R recorder device.

Driver:

Option menu to select the
driver that is used to access the device. If the device is
known by the internal device database the correct driver is
selected automatically. Otherwise "Undefined" will
be shown and a suitable driver must be selected before any
action can be performed with this device.

Driver Options:

Enter special driver options
here. The available options are described in the README (the
documentation will be moved to this place soon). If the
device is known by the internal device database the correct
option flags are selected automatically.

Device Node:

This field is only required for
operating systems that cannot access a SCSI device by the
bus,id,lun triple. In this case the device node that must be
used to access the device should be entered here.

Add Device
Frame 
This frame can be used to manually add a device. The
bus,id,lun triple of the device and the vendor/product
string must be specified before the "Add" button
has an effect. It is not possible to overwrite an existing
device with the same bus,id,lun triple. Use the
"Delete" button of the "Devices" frame
first in this case.

RECORD DIALOG (Actions->Record)

This non modal
dialog can be used to record the actual project on a
CD-R/CD-RW. It is possible to record the actual project on
multiple recorders simultaneously.

The
"Start" button will start recording processes on
all devices that are selected in the "Available
Recorder Devices" browser. For this purpose the
cdrdao executable will be called and should be
available in your PATH. For each selected device a non modal
progress dialog will be opened.

After the
recording is started on all selected devices it is possible
to load another toc-file or continue editing the existing
project. It is also safely possible to quit the GUI. The
recording will continue in background but you will have no
feedback about the progress.

The
"Cancel" button will close the dialog box.

Available
Recorder Devices Frame 
The browser shows all devices with device type CD-R or
CD-RW. Only devices with "Ready" status are
selectable.

Record
Options Frame 
Simulate/Write:

Selects between simulated or
real writing process.

Close Disk:

If selected disk will not be
appendable. Otherwise the recorded session is kept open.

Note: The
drivers &rsquo;generic-mmc-raw&rsquo;, 
&rsquo;sony-cdu920&rsquo; and &rsquo;yamaha-cdr10x&rsquo;
cannot keep the recorded session open.

Eject:

If selected the disk will be ejected after a successful
writing process.

Warning: This
may cause buffer under runs with certain device combinations
if multiple devices are recording.

Recording Speed:

May be used to set an upper
limit for the used recording speed. If a recorder device
does not support the speed the next lower possible speed is
used.

Reload:

If selected the disk will be
automatically reloaded if it appears to be not empty or not
appendable. This is required after a simulation run for some
devices (e.g. the Philips CDD2x00 recorder familiy).

Warning: This
may cause buffer under runs with certain device combinations
if multiple devices are recording.
