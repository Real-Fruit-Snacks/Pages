SYNOPSIS

pgmmorphconv

-erode | 
-dilate | 
-open | 
-close | 
-gradient ] templatefile [pgmfile]

Minimum unique
abbreviation of option is acceptable. You may use double
hyphens instead of single hyphen to denote options. You may
use white space in place of the equals sign to separate an
option name from its value.

DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

pgmmorphconv
performs morphological convolutions on a PGM image: dilation
and erosion.

pgmmorphconv
performs a "topological" convolution. For each
pixel of the input, pgmmorphconv generates an output
pixel in the same position. To determine the intensity of
the output pixel, pgmmorphconv lays the template
image over the input image such that the middle pixel of the
template is over the input pixel in question.
pgmmorphconv looks at the input pixels underneath
each white pixel in the template. For a dilation, the
maximum intensity of all those pixels is the intensity of
the output pixel. For an erosion, it is the minimum.

Thus, the
dilation effect is that bright areas of the input get bigger
and dark areas smaller. The erosion effect is the opposite.
The simplest template image would be one with a white pixel
in the middle and the rest black. This would produce an
output image identical to the input. Another simple template
image is a fully white square. This causes bright or dark
areas to expand in all directions. A template image that is
white on the left side and black on the right would smear
the image to the right.

The template
file named by templatefile contains the template
image as a PBM image. It must have an odd number of rows and
an odd number of columns, so there is a definite middle
pixel. It must contain at least one white pixel.

This is similar
to the continuous convolution done by pnmconvol,
except that with pnmconvol the output intensity is a
weighted average of nearby input pixels instead of a minimum
or maximum.

This
convolution changes the three Minkowski integrals in a
predefined way, and can be used to filter an image to
enhance certain features, to ease their automatic
recognition.

OPTIONS

In addition to
the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most
notably -quiet, see
 Common Options ),
pgmmorphconv recognizes the following command line
options:

The options
-erode and -dilate obviously produce an
erosion or dilation, respectively.

The
-open option causes pgmmorphconv to perform
first an erode and then a dilate operation. The
-close option causes a dilate first and then an
erode. If you specify none of these options, it is the same
as -dilate.

With
-gradient, pgmmorphconv produces an image
which is the difference between the eroded image and the
dilated image. -gradient was new in Netpbm 10.70
(March 2015).
