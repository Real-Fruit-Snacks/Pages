NAME

pamunlookup -
inverse of pamlookup

SYNOPSIS

pamunlookup
-lookupfile=lookupfile inputfile

All options can
be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix. You may use
two hyphens instead of one. You may separate an option name
and its value with white space instead of an equals
sign.

DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

pamunlookup
is best described as the inverse of pamlookup
(without -byplane). For example, the following
normally yields output identical to the input:

$ cat input.ppm
| \ 
pamunlookup -lookupfile=map.pam | \ 
pamlookup -lookupfile=map.pam \ 
> output.ppm

Specifically,
pamunlookup takes an input image and produces an
output image of the same width and height in which each
tuple is a single number. That number is the index in a
given lookup table of the tuple value that is in the same
position in the input image.

You specify the
lookup table the same way as for
pamlookup
.

Where a tuple
in the input image is not in the lookup table, the number
pamunlookup places in the output index image is one
greater than the highest index in the lookup table.
Accordingly, the maxval of the output index image is the
size of the lookup table.

Example

Here is an example of pamunlookup&rsquo;s
function.

Consider an
input image consisting of a 3x2 PPM as follows:

and a lookup
table consisting of a 3x1 PPM image as follows:

The lookup
table above says Index 0 corresponds to the color red, Index
1 corresponds to yellow, and Index 2 corresponds to beige.
The output of pamunlookup is the following index
image:

Miscellaneous

The inputfile argument identifies the file containing
the index PAM or PNM image. - means Standard Input.
It won&rsquo;t work if both the input image file and lookup
table file are Standard Input.

The output
index image goes to Standard Output.

OPTIONS

In addition to
the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most
notably -quiet, see
 Common Options ),
pamunlookup recognizes the following command line
option: 
-lookupfile=lookupfile

lookupfile names the
file that contains the PAM or PNM image that is the lookup
table. This option is mandatory.
