octave - A
high-level interactive programming language for numerical
computations.

SYNOPSIS

octave
[options]... [file]

DESCRIPTION

Octave is a
high-level interactive scientific programming language. It
has a powerful mathematics-oriented syntax for solving
problems numerically, as well as built-in 2-D/3-D plotting
and visualization tools. Octave provides an integrated
development environment in either graphical or command-line
form. Programs may also be run in batch mode to process data
without interaction.

OPTIONS

A list of the
most useful command-line options for octave is
available by running the following command from the
shell.

octave
--help

DOCUMENTATION

The primary
documentation for Octave is written using Texinfo, the GNU
documentation system, which allows the same source files to
be used to produce online and printed versions of the
manual.

You can read
the built-in copy of the Octave documentation by issuing the
following command from within octave.

octave:1>
doc

The Info files
may also be read with a stand-alone program such as
info or xinfo. HTML, Postscript, or PDF
versions of the documentation are installed on many systems
as well. The latest version of the documentation is
available at
https://docs.octave.org/latest">https://docs.octave.org/latest.

FILES

Upon startup
Octave looks for four initialization files. Each file may
contain any number of valid Octave commands. 
octave-home/share/octave/site/m/startup/octaverc

Site-wide initialization file
which changes options for all users. octave-home is
the directory where Octave was installed such as
/usr/local.

octave-home/share/octave/version/m/startup/octaverc

Site-wide initialization file
for Octave version version.

~/.octaverc

User&rsquo;s personal
initialization file.

.octaverc

Project-specific initialization
file located in the current directory.
