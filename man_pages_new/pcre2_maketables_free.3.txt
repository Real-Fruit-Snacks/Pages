NAME

PCRE2 -
Perl-compatible regular expressions (revised API)

SYNOPSIS

#include

void
pcre2_maketables_free(pcre2_general_context
*gcontext, 
const uint8_t *tables);

DESCRIPTION

This function
discards a set of character tables that were created by a
call to pcre2_maketables().

The
gcontext parameter should match what was used in that
call to account for any custom allocators that might be in
use; if it is NULL the system free() is used.

There is a
complete description of the PCRE2 native API in the
pcre2api page.
