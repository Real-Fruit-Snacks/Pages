NAME

getexeccon,
setexeccon - get or set the SELinux security context used
for executing a new process

rpm_execcon -
run a helper for rpm in an appropriate security context

SYNOPSIS

#include

int
getexeccon(char **context);

int
getexeccon_raw(char **context);

int
setexeccon(char *context);

int
setexeccon_raw(char *context);

int
setexecfilecon(const char *filename, const
char *fallback_type);

int
rpm_execcon(unsigned int verified, const char
*filename, char *const argv[] ,
char *const envp[]);

DESCRIPTION

getexeccon()
retrieves the context used for executing a new process. This
returned context should be freed with freecon(3) if
non-NULL. getexeccon() sets *context to
NULL if no exec context has been explicitly set by the
program (i.e. using the default policy behavior).

setexeccon()
sets the context used for the next execve(2) call.
NULL can be passed to setexeccon() to reset to the
default policy behavior. The exec context is automatically
reset after the next execve(2), so a program
doesn&rsquo;t need to explicitly sanitize it upon
startup.

setexeccon()
can be applied prior to library functions that internally
perform an execve(2), e.g. execl*(3),
execv*(3), popen(3), in order to set an exec
context for that operation.

getexeccon_raw()
and setexeccon_raw() behave identically to their
non-raw counterparts but do not perform context
translation.

Note:
Signal handlers that perform an execve(2) must take
care to save, reset, and restore the exec context to avoid
unexpected behavior.

setexecfilecon()
sets the context used for the next execve(2) call,
based on the policy for the filename, and falling
back to a new context with a fallback_type in case
there is no transition.

rpm_execcon()
is deprecated; please use setexecfilecon() in
conjunction with execve(2) in all new code. This
function runs a helper for rpm in an appropriate security
context. The verified parameter should contain the return
code from the signature verification (0 == ok, 1 ==
notfound, 2 == verifyfail, 3 == nottrusted, 4 == nokey),
although this information is not yet used by the function.
The function determines the proper security context for the
helper based on policy, sets the exec context accordingly,
and then executes the specified filename with the provided
argument and environment arrays.

RETURN VALUE

On error -1 is
returned.

On success
getexeccon(), setexeccon() and
setexecfilecon() return 0. rpm_execcon() only
returns upon errors, as it calls execve(2).
