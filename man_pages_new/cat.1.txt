NAME

cat, read, nobs
- catenate files

SYNOPSIS

cat [
file ... ] 
read [ -m ] [ -n nline ] [ file
... ] 
nobs [ file ... ]

DESCRIPTION

Cat
reads each file in sequence and writes it on the
standard output. Thus

cat file

prints a file
and

cat file1 file2
>file3

concatenates
the first two files and places the result on the third.

If no
file is given, cat reads from the standard
input. Output is buffered in blocks matching the input.

Read
copies to standard output exactly one line from the named
file, default standard input. It is useful in
interactive rc(1) scripts.

The -m
flag causes it to continue reading and writing multiple
lines until end of file; -n causes it to read no more
than nline lines.

Read
always executes a single write for each line of
input, which can be helpful when preparing input to programs
that expect line-at-a-time data. It never reads any more
data from the input than it prints to the output.

Nobs
copies the named files to standard output except that it
removes all backspace characters and the characters that
precede them. It is useful to use as $PAGER with the
Unix version of man(1) when run inside a win
(see acme(1)) window.

DIAGNOSTICS

Read
exits with status eof on end of file or, in the
-n case, if it doesn&rsquo;t read nlines
lines.

BUGS

Beware of and
which destroy input files before reading them.
