NAME

podman-manifest-push
- Push a manifest list or image index to a registry

SYNOPSIS

podman
manifest push [options]
listnameorindexname [destination]

DESCRIPTION

Pushes a
manifest list or image index to a registry.

RETURN VALUE

The list
image&rsquo;s ID and the digest of the image&rsquo;s
manifest.

OPTIONS

--add-compression=compression

Makes sure that requested compression variant for each
platform is added to the manifest list keeping original
instance intact in the same manifest list. Supported values
are (gzip, zstd and zstd:chunked).
Following flag can be used multiple times.

Note that
--compression-format controls the compression format
of each instance in the manifest list.
--add-compression will add another variant for each
instance in the list with the specified compressions.
--compression-format gzip --add-compression
zstd will push a manifest list with each instance being
compressed with gzip plus an additional variant of each
instance being compressed with zstd.

--all

Push the images mentioned in the manifest list or image
index, in addition to the list or index itself. (Default
true)

--authfile=path

Path of the authentication file. Default is
${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/containers/auth.json on Linux, and
$HOME/.config/containers/auth.json on Windows/macOS.
The file is created by podman login. If the
authorization state is not found there,
$HOME/.docker/config.json is checked, which is set
using docker login.

Note: There is
also the option to override the default path of the
authentication file by setting the REGISTRY_AUTH_FILE
environment variable. This can be done with export
REGISTRY_AUTH_FILE=path.

--cert-dir=path

Use certificates at path (*.crt, *.cert, *.key) to
connect to the registry. (Default: /etc/containers/certs.d)
For details, see containers-certs.d(5). (This option
is not available with the remote Podman client, including
Mac and Windows (excluding WSL2) machines)

--compression-format=gzip
| zstd | zstd:chunked 
Specifies the compression format to use. Supported values
are: gzip, zstd and zstd:chunked. The
default is gzip unless overridden in the
containers.conf file.

--compression-level=level

Specifies the compression level to use. The value is
specific to the compression algorithm used, e.g. for zstd
the accepted values are in the range 1-20 (inclusive) with a
default of 3, while for gzip it is 1-9 (inclusive) and has a
default of 5.

--creds=[username[:password]]

The [username[:password]] to use to authenticate with the
registry, if required. If one or both values are not
supplied, a command line prompt appears and the value can be
entered. The password is entered without echo.

Note that the
specified credentials are only used to authenticate against
target registries. They are not used for mirrors or when the
registry gets rewritten (see
containers-registries.conf(5)); to authenticate
against those consider using a
containers-auth.json(5) file.

--digestfile=Digestfile

After copying the image, write the digest of the resulting
image to the file.

--force-compression

If set, push uses the specified compression algorithm even
if the destination contains a differently-compressed variant
already. Defaults to true if
--compression-format is explicitly specified on the
command-line, false otherwise.

--format,
-f=format 
Manifest list type (oci or v2s2) to use when pushing the
list (default is oci).

--quiet,
-q 
When writing the manifest, suppress progress output

--remove-signatures

Don&rsquo;t copy signatures when pushing images.

--rm

Delete the manifest list or image index from local storage
if pushing succeeds.

--sign-by=fingerprint

Sign the pushed images with a &ldquo;simple signing&rdquo;
signature using the specified key. (This option is not
available with the remote Podman client, including Mac and
Windows (excluding WSL2) machines)

--sign-by-sigstore=*param-file***

Add a sigstore signature based on further options specified
in a container&rsquo;s sigstore signing parameter file
param-file. See
containers-sigstore-signing-params.yaml(5) for details about
the file format.

--sign-by-sigstore-private-key=path

Sign the pushed images with a sigstore signature using a
private key at the specified path. (This option is not
available with the remote Podman client, including Mac and
Windows (excluding WSL2) machines)

--sign-passphrase-file=path

If signing the image (using either --sign-by or
--sign-by-sigstore-private-key), read the passphrase
to use from the specified path.

--tls-verify

Require HTTPS and verify certificates when contacting
registries (default: true). If explicitly set to
true, TLS verification is used. If set to
false, TLS verification is not used. If not
specified, TLS verification is used unless the target
registry is listed as an insecure registry in
containers-registries.conf(5)

DESTINATION

DESTINATION is
the location the container image is pushed to. It supports
all transports from containers-transports(5). If no
transport is specified, the docker (i.e., container
registry) transport is used. For remote clients, including
Mac and Windows (excluding WSL2) machines, docker is
the only supported transport.

EXAMPLE

podman manifest
push mylist:v1.11
docker://registry.example.org/mylist:v1.11
