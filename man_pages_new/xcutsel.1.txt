NAME

xcutsel -
interchange between cut buffer and selection

SYNOPSIS

xcutsel
[ -toolkitoption ...] [-selection selection]
[-cutbuffer number]

DESCRIPTION

The
xcutsel program is used to copy the current selection
into a cut buffer and to make a selection that contains the
current contents of the cut buffer. It acts as a bridge
between applications that don&rsquo;t support selections and
those that do.

By default,
xcutsel will use the selection named PRIMARY and the
cut buffer CUT_BUFFER0. Either or both of these can be
overridden by command line arguments or by resources.

An
xcutsel window has the following buttons: 
quit

When this button is pressed,
xcutsel exits. Any selections held by xcutsel
are automatically released.

copy PRIMARY to 0

When this button is pressed,
xcutsel copies the current selection into the cut
buffer.

copy 0 to PRIMARY

When this button is pressed,
xcutsel converts the current contents of the cut
buffer into the selection.

The button
labels reflect the selection and cutbuffer selected by
command line options or through the resource database.

When the
&rsquo;&rsquo;copy 0 to PRIMARY&rsquo;&rsquo; button is
activated, the button will remain inverted as long as
xcutsel remains the owner of the selection. This
serves to remind you which client owns the current
selection. Note that the value of the selection remains
constant; if the cutbuffer is changed, you must again
activate the copy button to retrieve the new value when
desired.

OPTIONS

Xcutsel
accepts all of the standard X Toolkit command line options
as well as the following: 
-selection name

This option specifies the name
of the selection to use. The default is PRIMARY. The only
supported abbreviations for this option are
&rsquo;&rsquo;-select&rsquo;&rsquo;,
&rsquo;&rsquo;-sel&rsquo;&rsquo; and
&rsquo;&rsquo;-s&rsquo;&rsquo;, as the standard toolkit
option &rsquo;&rsquo;-selectionTimeout&rsquo;&rsquo; has a
similar name.

-cutbuffer
number

This option specifies the cut
buffer to use. The default is cut buffer 0.

X DEFAULTS

accepts all of the standard X Toolkit resource names and
classes as well as: 
selection (class Selection)

This resource specifies the
name of the selection to use. The default is PRIMARY.

cutBuffer (class

This resource specifies the
number of the cut buffer to use. The default is 0.
