NAME

EXIGREP -
Search Exim&rsquo;s main log

SYNOPSIS

exigrep
[-l] pattern [log file] ...

DESCRIPTION

The
exigrep utility is a Perl script that searches one or
more main log files for entries that match a given pattern.
When it finds a match, it extracts all the log entries for
the relevant message, not just those that match the pattern.
Thus, exigrep can extract complete log entries for a
given message, or all mail for a given user, or for a given
host, for example.

The -l
flag means &rsquo;literal&rsquo;, that is, treat all
characters in the pattern as standing for themselves.
Otherwise the pattern must be a Perl regular expression. The
pattern match is case-insensitive. If no file names are
given on the command line, the standard input is read.

If the location
of a zcat command is known from the definition of
ZCAT_COMMAND in Local/Makefile, exigrep automatically
passes any file whose name ends in COMPRESS_SUFFIX through
zcat as it searches it.
