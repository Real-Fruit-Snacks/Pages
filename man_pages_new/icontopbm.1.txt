NAME

icontopbm -
replaced by sunicontopnm

SYNOPSIS

icontopbm
[iconfile]

DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

icontopbm
was obsoleted by sunicontopnm(1), introduced with
Netpbm 10.53 (December 2010). sunicontopnm is
backward compatible with icontopbm, plus adds
additional functions, including the ability to convert a
Depth=8 Sun icon, producing a PGM image.

Starting in
Release 10.53, icontopbm is just an alias for
sunicontopnm.

The point of
the name change is that there are many kinds of icons in the
world besides Sun icons, and in 2010, the Sun variety
isn&rsquo;t even common.

In releases
before 10.53, you can use the sunicontopnm
documentation for icontopbm, as long as you recognize
that any change the sunicontopnm manual says happened
in or after Netpbm 10.53 doesn&rsquo;t apply to
icontopbm.
