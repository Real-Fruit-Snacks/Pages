NAME

pnmindex -
build a visual index of a bunch of PNM images

SYNOPSIS

pnmindex

[-size=N]

[-across=N]

[-black]

[-title=title]

[-quant|-noquant]

[-colors=N]

pnmfile
...

You can use the
minimum unique abbreviation of the options. You can use two
hyphens instead of one. You can separate an option name from
its value with white space instead of an equals sign.

DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

pnmindex
creates an index image containing thumbnail (small) versions
of a bunch of PNM files you supply (akin to a photographic
"contact sheet").

pnmindex
labels each thumbnail and, optionally, contains a title.

If you just
want to concatenate some images together in a grid, use
pamundice for that.

If you want to
take apart the image you generated with pnmindex, use
pamdice or pamcut.

The program can
generate large temporary files. By default, these go in
directory /tmp, but you can usse the TMPDIR
environment variable to have them somewhere else.

OPTIONS

In addition to
the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most
notably -quiet, see
 Common Options ),
pnmindex recognizes the following command line
options: 
-size=N

The size of each thumbnail. The
image is scaled down to fit maximally inside a N x
N pixel box without changing its aspect ratio.

If the input
image is already smaller than this, its size remains the
same in the output.

The value must
be at least 1.

The default is
100.

-across=N

This is the number of
thumbnails in each row.

The value must
be at least 1.

The default is
6.

-black

This controls the color of the padding between the
images; by default it is white and the labels are black
lettering on white background, but the -black option
reverses this.

-title=title

This specifies a title to be
placed at the top of the image.

The
title value must be in ASCII. Characters that are not
valid ASCII are not rendered.

Default is no
title.

-noquant

Disables color quantization. By
default, if any input image is PPM, the program reduces the
number of colors to the number of colors specified by
-colors).

-quant

This option has no effect; it explicitly selects the
default behavior of quantizing colors. See
-noquant. 

-colors=N

The maximum number of colors
allowed in the overall image. If it would otherwise have
more colors than these, pnmindex quantizes the
result. To reduce the effect of the colors in one thumbnail
on the colors used for another, the program quantizes colors
to this number in each thumbnail independently, then
quantizes the colors in each row of thumbnails to this
number, then quantizes the colors in the entire output image
to this number.

This value is
meaningless if you specify the -noquant option or if
no input image is PPM.

The default is
256.

HISTORY

Before Netpbm
11.05 (December 2023), the Netpbm common option
-plain was not implemented.
