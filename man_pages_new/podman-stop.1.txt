NAME

podman-stop -
Stop one or more running containers

SYNOPSIS

podman
stop [options] container ...

podman
container stop [options] container ...

DESCRIPTION

Stops one or
more containers using container IDs or names as input. The
--time option specifies the number of seconds to wait
before forcibly stopping the container after the stop
command is issued to the container. The default is 10
seconds. By default, containers are stopped with SIGTERM and
then SIGKILL after the timeout. The SIGTERM default can be
overridden by the image used to create the container and
also via command line when creating the container.

OPTIONS

--all,
-a 
Stop all running containers. This does not include paused
containers.

--cidfile=file

Read container ID from the specified file and stop
the container. Can be specified multiple times.

Command does
not fail when file is missing and user specified
--ignore.

--filter,
-f=filter 
Filter what containers are going to be stopped. Multiple
filters can be given with multiple uses of the --filter
flag. Filters with the same key work inclusive with the only
exception being label which is exclusive. Filters
with different keys always work exclusive.

Valid filters
are listed below:

--ignore, -i 
Ignore errors when specified containers are not in the
container store. A user might have decided to manually
remove a container which leads to a failure during the
ExecStop directive of a systemd service referencing that
container.

--latest,
-l 
Instead of providing the container name or ID, use the last
created container. Note: the last started container can be
from other users of Podman on the host machine. (This option
is not available with the remote Podman client, including
Mac and Windows (excluding WSL2) machines)

--time,
-t=seconds 
Seconds to wait before forcibly stopping the container. Use
-1 for infinite wait.
