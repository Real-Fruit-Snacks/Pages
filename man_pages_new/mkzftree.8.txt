NAME

mkzftree
&minus; Create a zisofs/RockRidge compressed file tree

SYNOPSIS

mkzftree
[OPTIONS]... INPUT OUTPUT

DESCRIPTION

Takes an input
file tree (INPUT) and create a corresponding
compressed file tree (OUTPUT) that can be used with
an appropriately patched mkisofs(8) to create a
transparent-compression ISO 9660/Rock Ridge filesystem using
the "ZF" compression records. 
&minus;f, &minus;&minus;force

Always compress all files, even
if they get larger when compressed.

&minus;z level,
&minus;&minus;level level

Select compression level (1-9,
default is 9). Lower compression levels are faster, but
typically result in larger output.

&minus;u,
&minus;&minus;uncompress

Uncompress an already
compressed tree. This can be used to read a compressed
filesystem on a system which cannot read them natively.

&minus;p
parallelism, &minus;&minus;parallelism
parallelism

Compress in parallel. The
parallelism value indicates how many compression
threads are allowed to run.

&minus;x,
&minus;&minus;one-filesystem

Do not cross filesystem
boundaries, but create directory stubs at mount points.

&minus;X,
&minus;&minus;strict-one-filesystem

Do not cross filesystem
boundaries, and do not create directory stubs at mount
points.

&minus;C path,
&minus;&minus;crib-tree path

Steal ("crib") files
from another directory if it looks (based on name, size,
type and modification time) like they match entries in the
new filesystem. The "crib tree" is usually the
compressed version of an older version of the same workload;
this thus allows for "incremental rebuilds" of a
compressed filesystem tree. The files are hardlinked from
the crib tree to the output tree, so if it is desirable to
keep the link count correct the crib path should be deleted
before running mkisofs. The crib tree must be on the
same filesystem as the output tree.

&minus;l,
&minus;&minus;local

Do not recurse into
subdirectories, but create the directories themselves.

&minus;L,
&minus;&minus;strict-local

Do not recurse into
subdirectories, and do not create directories.

&minus;F,
&minus;&minus;file

Indicates that INPUT may
not necessarily be a directory; this allows operation on a
single file. Note especially that if &minus;F is
specified, and INPUT is a symlink, the symlink itself
will be copied rather than whatever it happens to point
to.

&minus;s,
&minus;&minus;sloppy

Treat file modes, times and
ownership data as less than precious information and
don&rsquo;t abort if they cannot be set. This may be useful
if running mkisofs on an input tree you do not
own.

&minus;v,
&minus;&minus;verbose

Increase the program
verbosity.

&minus;V value,
&minus;&minus;verbosity value

Set the program verbosity to
value.

&minus;q,
&minus;&minus;quiet

Issue no messages whatsoever,
including error messages. This is the same as specifying
&minus;V 0.

&minus;h,
&minus;&minus;help

Display a brief help
message.

&minus;w,
&minus;&minus;version

Display the release
version.

BUGS

Long options
(beginning with &minus;&minus;) may not work on all
systems. See the message printed out by
mkzftree &minus;h to see if this applies to your
system.

Inode change
times (ctimes) are not copied. This is a system limitation
and applies to all file copy programs.

If using the
parallel option (&minus;p) the access times (atimes)
on directories may or may not be copied. If it is important
that the atimes on directories are copied exactly, avoid
using &minus;p.
