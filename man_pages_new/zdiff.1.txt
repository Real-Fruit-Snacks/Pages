NAME

zcmp -
decompress and compare two files byte by byte

SYNOPSIS

zcmp
[options] file1 [file2]

DESCRIPTION

zcmp compares
two files and, if they differ, writes to standard output the
first byte and line number where they differ. Bytes and
lines are numbered starting with 1. A hyphen &rsquo;-&rsquo;
used as a file argument means standard input. If any file
given is compressed, its decompressed content is used.
Compressed files are decompressed on the fly; no temporary
files are created.

The formats
supported are bzip2, gzip, lzip, xz, and zstd.

zcmp compares
file1 to file2. The standard input is used only if file1 or
file2 refers to standard input. If file2 is omitted zcmp
tries to compare file1 with the corresponding uncompressed
file (if file1 is compressed), and then with the
corresponding compressed files of the remaining formats
until one is found.

Exit status is
0 if inputs are identical, 1 if different, 2 if trouble.

OPTIONS

-h,
--help

display this help and exit

-V, --version

output version information and
exit

-b,
--print-bytes

print differing bytes

-H,
--hexadecimal

print hexadecimal values
instead of octal

-i,
--ignore-initial=[:]

ignore differences in the first
 bytes

-l, --list

list position, value of all
differing bytes

-M,
--format=

process only the formats in

-n,
--bytes=

compare at most 
bytes

-N,
--no-rcfile

don&rsquo;t read runtime
configuration file

-O,
--force-format=[][,]

force one or both input
formats

-q, --quiet,
--silent

suppress diagnostics written to
stderr

-s, --script

suppress messages about file
differences

-v, --verbose

verbose mode (opposite of
--quiet)

--bz2=

set compressor and options for
bzip2 format

--gz=

set compressor and options for
gzip format

--lz=

set compressor and options for
lzip format

--xz=

set compressor and options for
xz format

--zst=

set compressor and options for
zstd format

Valid formats
for options &rsquo;-M&rsquo; and &rsquo;-O&rsquo; are
&rsquo;bz2&rsquo;, &rsquo;gz&rsquo;, &rsquo;lz&rsquo;,
&rsquo;xz&rsquo;, &rsquo;zst&rsquo;, and &rsquo;un&rsquo;
for uncompressed.

Byte counts
given as arguments to options may be expressed in decimal,
hexadecimal, or octal (using the same syntax as integer
constants in C++), and may be followed by a multiplier: k =
kB = 10^3 = 1000, Ki = KiB = 2^10 = 1024, M = 10^6, Mi =
2^20, G = 10^9, Gi = 2^30, etc.
