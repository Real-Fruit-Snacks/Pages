groff_rfc1345 -
special character names from RFC 1345 and Vim digraphs

Description

The file
rfc1345.tmac defines special character escape
sequences for groff(7) based on the glyph mnemonics
specified in RFC 1345 and the digraph table of the text
editor Vim. Each escape sequence translates to a Unicode
code point, and will render correctly if the underlying font
is a Unicode font that covers the code point.

For example,
&ldquo;\[Rx]&rdquo; is the &ldquo;recipe&rdquo; or
&ldquo;prescription take&rdquo; symbol, and maps to the code
point U+211E. groff lets you write it as
&ldquo;\[u211E]&rdquo;, but
&ldquo;\[Rx]&rdquo; is more mnemonic.

For a list of
the glyph names provided, please see the file
rfc1345.tmac, which contains definitions of the
form

.char \[Rx] \[u211E] \"
PRESCRIPTION TAKE

where .char&rsquo;s
first argument defines a groff special character
escape sequence with a mnemonic glyph name, its second
argument is a special character escape sequence based on the
code point, and the comment describes the glyph defined.

The RFC 1345
glyph names cover a wide range of Unicode code points,
including supplemental Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, Hebrew,
Arabic, Hiragana, Katakana, and Bopomofo letters,
punctuation, math notation, currency symbols, industrial and
entertainment icons, and box-drawing symbols.

The Vim digraph
table is practically a subset of RFC 1345 (being limited to
two-character mnemonics), but, as a newer implementation,
adds four mnemonics not specified in the RFC (the horizontal
ellipsis, the Euro sign, and two mappings for the rouble
sign). These have also been added to
rfc1345.tmac.

rfc1345.tmac
contains a total of 1,696 glyph names. It is not an error to
load rfc1345.tmac if your font does not have all the
glyphs, as long as it contains the glyphs that you actually
use in your document.

The RFC 1345
mnemonics are not identical in every case to the mappings
for special character glyph names that are built in to
groff; for example, &ldquo;\[&rdquo;
means the &ldquo;much less than&rdquo; sign (U+226A) when
rfc1345.tmac is not loaded and this special character
is not otherwise defined by a document or macro package.
rfc1345.tmac redefines
&ldquo;\[&rdquo; to the &ldquo;left-pointing
double angle quotation mark&rdquo; (U+00AB). See
groff_char(7) for the full list of predefined special
character escape sequences.

Usage

Load the rfc1345.tmac file. This can be done by
either adding &ldquo;.mso rfc1345.tmac&rdquo; to your
document before the first use of any of the glyph names the
macro file defines, or by using the troff(1) option
&ldquo;-m rfc1345&rdquo; from the shell.

Bugs

As the groff Texinfo manual notes, &ldquo;[o]nly the
current font is checked for ligatures and kerns; neither
special fonts nor entities defined with the char
request (and its siblings) are taken into account.&rdquo;
Many of the characters defined in rfc1345.tmac are
accented Latin letters, and will be affected by this
deficiency,

subpar typography.
