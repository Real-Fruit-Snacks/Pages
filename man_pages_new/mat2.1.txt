DESCRIPTION

mat2
removes metadata from various fileformats. It supports a
wide variety of file formats, audio, office, images,
&#8230;

Careful, mat2
does not clean files in-place, instead, it will produce a
file with the word "cleaned" between the filename
and its extension, for example
"filename.cleaned.png" for a file named
"filename.png".

NOTES ABOUT METADATA

While mat2 is
doing its very best to display metadata when the --show flag
is passed, it doesn&rsquo;t mean that a file is clean from
any metadata if mat2 doesn&rsquo;t show any. There is no
reliable way to detect every single possible metadata for
complex file formats.

This is why you
shouldn&rsquo;t rely on metadata&rsquo;s presence to decide
if your file must be cleaned or not.

Moreover, mat2
goes to great lengths to make sure that as much metadata as
possible are removed. This might sometimes result in a loss
of quality of the processed files. For example, textual
based pdf file converted into image based one means that
it&rsquo;ll be no longer possible to select text in them. If
you&rsquo;re experiencing this, you might want to give the
lightweight cleaning mode a try, but keep in mind by doing
so, some metadata won&rsquo;t be cleaned.

BUGS

While mat2 does
its very best to remove every single metadata, it&rsquo;s
still in beta, and some might remain. Should you
encounter some issues, check the bugtracker:

Please use
accordingly and be careful.
