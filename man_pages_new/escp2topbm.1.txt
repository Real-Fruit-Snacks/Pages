NAME

escp2topbm -
convert an ESC/P2 printer file to a PBM image

SYNOPSIS

escp2topbm
[printfile]

DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

escp2topbm
reads an ESC/P2 printer control stream as input. It produces
a PBM image as output.

escp2topbm
filters the raster graphic content from an Epson ESC/P2
printer control stream and writes the image it would print
as a standard (raw) PBM image.

The input is
from the file named by the printfile argument, or
from Standard Input if you don&rsquo;t specify
printfile. The output is to Standard Output.

escp2topbm
understands compression modes 0 (uncompressed) and 1 (RLE
compressed) in the Epson input stream.

OPTIONS

There are no
command line options defined specifically for
escp2topbm, but it recognizes the options common to
all programs based on libnetpbm (See
 Common Options
.)

Before Netpbm
10.72 (September 2015), the Netpbm common option
-plain has no effect on escp2topbm .

HINTS

As
escp2topbm is a simple program, created mainly to
test pbmtoescp2, there are some restrictions:

&bull;

escp2topbm looks only at "ESC."
sequences and ignores all data outside these Escape
sequences. 

&bull;

escp2topbm assumes that only one raster graphic
is in the printer stream. If this isn&rsquo;t true, the
result is garbage.

&bull;

escp2topbm assumes that all "ESC."
sequences use the same width value. If this isn&rsquo;t
true, the result is garbage.
