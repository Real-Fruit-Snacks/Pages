Decodes DVD-Video file structure

DESCRIPTION

into the current directory an XML control file and
corresponding MPEG-2 files (with a .vob extension) that
dvdauthor can (hopefully) interpret to recreate the
DVD-Video directory structure.

BUGS

Depends on
libdvdread to decode the DVD-Video structure and to report
any errors trying to do so. But libdvdread will sometimes
just exit without reporting any error.
