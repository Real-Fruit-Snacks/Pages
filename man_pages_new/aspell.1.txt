NAME

aspell -
interactive spell checker

SYNOPSIS

aspell
[options] 

DESCRIPTION

aspell
is a utility program that connects to the Aspell library so
that it can function as an ispell -a replacement, as
an independent spell checker, as a test utility to test out
Aspell library features, and as a utility for managing
dictionaries used by the library.

The Aspell
library contains an interface allowing other programs direct
access to its functions and therefore reducing the complex
task of spell checking to simple library calls. The default
library does not contain dictionary word lists. To add
language dictionaries, please check your distro first for
modified dictionaries, otherwise look here for base language
dictionaries http://aspell.net&gt;.

The following
information describes the commands and options used by the
Aspell Utility.

page is maintained separately from the official
documentation so it may be out of date or incomplete. The
official documentation is maintained as a Texinfo manual.

DICTIONARY OPTIONS

The following

this dictionary or die.

--dict-dir=

--lang=,
-l 

Language to use. It follows the
same format of the LANG environmental variable on most

and an optional two letter ISO 3166 country code after a

of the LC_MESSAGES locale.

--size=

file.

ASPELL UTILITY OPTIONS

These options
are part of the aspell Utility and work independently
of the library. 
--backup, --dont-backup, -b, -x

The aspell utility creates a
backup file by making a copy and appending .bak to
file name. This only applies when the command is check
 and the backup file is only created if any
spelling modifications take place.

--byte-offsets,
--dont-byte-offsets

Use byte offsets instead of
character offsets.

--guess,
--dont-guess, -m, -P

Create missing root/affix
combinations not in the dictionary in pipe mode.

--keymapping=aspell,
--keymapping=ispell

The keymapping to use, either
aspell for the default mapping or ispell to
use the same mapping that the Ispell utility uses.

--reverse,
--dont-reverse

Reverse the order of the
suggestions list in pipe mode.

--suggest,
--dont-suggest

Suggest possible replacements
in pipe mode. If false, Aspell will simply report the
misspelling and make no attempt at suggestions or possible
corrections.

--time,
--dont-time

Time the load time and suggest
a time in pipe mode.

In addition
Aspell will try to make sense out of Ispell&rsquo;s command
line options so that it can function as a drop in
replacement for Ispell. If Aspell is run without any command
line options it will display a brief help screen and
quit.

CONFIGURATION

Aspell can
accept options via global or personal configuration files so
that you do not need to specify them each time at the
command line. The default global configuration file is
/etc/aspell.conf or another file specified by option
--conf and is checked first. The default per user
configuration file ~/.aspell.conf located in the
$HOME directory (or another file specified by option
--per-conf) is checked next and overrides options set
in the global config file. Options specified at either the
command line or via an environmental variable override those
specified by either configuration file.

Each line of
the configuration file has the format:

option
[value]

where
option is any one of the standard library options
above without the leading dashes. For example the following
line will set the default language to Swiss German:

lang
de_CH

There may be
any number of spaces between the option and the value,
however it can only be spaces, i.e. there is no
&rsquo;=&rsquo; between the option name and the value.
Comments may also be included by preceding them with a
&rsquo;#&rsquo; as anything from a &rsquo;#&rsquo; to a
newline is ignored. Blank lines are also allowed. The
/etc/aspell.conf file is a good example of how to set
these options and the Aspell Manual has more detailed
info.
