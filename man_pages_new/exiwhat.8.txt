NAME

exiwhat -
Finding out what Exim processes are doing

SYNOPSIS

exiwhat

DESCRIPTION

On operating
systems that can restart a system call after receiving a
signal (most modern OS), an Exim process responds to
the SIGUSR1 signal by writing a line describing what it is
doing to the file exim-process.info in the Exim spool
directory. The exiwhat script sends the signal to all
Exim processes it can find, having first emptied the
file. It then waits for one second to allow the Exim
processes to react before displaying the results. In order
to run exiwhat successfully you have to have
sufficient privilege to send the signal to the Exim
processes, so it is normally run as root.

Unfortunately,
the ps command which exiwhat uses to find
Exim processes varies in different operating systems.
Not only are different options used, but the format of the
output is different. For this reason, there are some system
configuration options that configure exactly how
exiwhat works. If it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be working
for you, check the following compile-time options: 
EXIWHAT_PS_CMD

the command for running
&ldquo;ps&rdquo;

EXIWHAT_PS_ARG

the argument for
&ldquo;ps&rdquo;

EXIWHAT_EGREP_ARG

the argument for
&ldquo;egrep&rdquo; to select from &ldquo;ps&rdquo;
output

EXIWHAT_KILL_ARG

the argument for the
&ldquo;kill&rdquo; command

An example of
typical output from exiwhat is

164 daemon:
-q1h, listening on port 25 
10483 running queue: waiting for 0tAycK-0002ij-00 (10492)

10492 delivering 0tAycK-0002ij-00 to mail.ref.example
[10.19.42.42] 
(editor [AT] ref.example) 
10592 handling incoming call from [192.168.243.242] 
10628 accepting a local non-SMTP message

The first
number in the output line is the process number. The third
line has been split here, in order to fit it on the
page.

than us and has more experience in writing manual pages, any
patches would be greatly appreciated.
