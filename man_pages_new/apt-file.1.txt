apt&minus;file
&minus;&minus; APT package searching utility &minus;&minus;
command&minus;line interface

SYNOPSIS

apt-file
[options] search pattern

apt-file
[options] show package

DESCRIPTION

apt-file
is a command line tool for searching files in packages for
the APT package management system.

Some actions
are required to run the search: 
find

Alias for search.

list

List the contents of a package.
This action is very close to the dpkg &minus;L
command except the package does not need to be installed or
fetched.

By default, the
list action interprets its pattern as if
&minus;&minus;fixed&minus;string was specified.

list-indices

List the known Content indices
and their status in a human readable format. These indices
can be searched via the &minus;I option (when enabled
and after fetching the indices). The output is subject to
change without notice and is therefore unsuited for script
usage / automation.

For a
machine-readable formats (e.g. automation), please use
apt-config dump (search for options starting with
Acquire::IndexTargets) and apt-get
indextargets for checking the cache (Look for entries
with an Identifier field starting with
Contents&minus;).

Note that
individual sources.list entries can override the global
default. Please consult sources.list(5) for more
information on advanced configuration of the
sources.list files.

search

Search in which package a file
is included. A list of all packages containing the pattern
pattern is returned.

Since Contents
files does not contain directories, the pattern must match
(part of a) file name.

By default, the
search action interprets its pattern as if
&minus;&minus;substring&minus;match was
specified.

show

Alias for list.

update

This action that just calls
apt update or apt-get update (depending on
whether a tty is available).

The only
advantage using this over a regular apt update or
apt-get update directly is for the case where you
have configured an apt-file specific configuration (via the
Dir::Etc::apt&minus;file&minus;main configuration
option). In that case, said configuration will be included
automatically.

OPTIONS

The following
options are available: 
&minus;a, &minus;&minus;architecture
architecture[,...]

This option is useful if you
search a package for a different architecture from the one
installed on your system.

It can be a
comma-separated list for searching on multiple
architectures.

&minus;c,
&minus;&minus;config&minus;file APT
config-file

Configuration File; Specify a
configuration file to use. The program will read the default
configuration file and then this configuration file. If
configuration settings need to be set before the default
configuration files are parsed specify a file with the
APT_CONFIG environment variable. See
apt.conf(5) for syntax information.

The
configuration file will be read relative to when it appears
on the command line and can overwrite options that appear
before it.

Note that the
config file will also be passed to all APT
tools called by apt-file.

&minus;D,
&minus;&minus;from&minus;deb

Use contents of the given .deb
archives(s) as patterns. Useful for searching for file
conflicts with other packages. Implies &minus;F.

&minus;f,
&minus;&minus;from&minus;file

Read patterns from the given
file(s), one per line. Use &minus; as filename for stdin. If
no files are given, then the list will be read from stdin.
This is much faster than invoking apt-file many times.

&minus;&minus;filter&minus;origins
origin[,...]

Only search indices from the
listed origins (e.g. "Debian").

This filter
matches against the name listed in the Origin field
from the Release file.

If set to
&rsquo;*&rsquo;, this filter will be disabled (mostly useful
for overriding the setting in a configuration file)

Alias of the
APT config option:
apt&minus;file::Search&minus;Filter::Origin

&minus;&minus;filter&minus;suites
suite[,...]

Only search indices from the
listed suites or codenames (e.g. "unstable").

This filter
matches against the name listed in the Codename and
Suite fields from the Release file. This means that
either "unstable" or "sid" will match
Debian&rsquo;s unstable suite.

If set to
&rsquo;*&rsquo;, this filter will be disabled (mostly useful
for overriding the setting in a configuration file)

Alias of the
APT config option:
apt&minus;file::Search&minus;Filter::Suite

&minus;F,
&minus;&minus;fixed&minus;string

Do not expand search pattern
with generic characters at pattern&rsquo;s start and
end.

This is default
for show and list actions.

&minus;&minus;index&minus;names
type[,...], &minus;I type[,...]

Only search indexes of the
given name(s). If set to the special value
ALL (case-sensitive), then all
apt-file indices are searched.

The name(s)
must match one or more of the identifiers used in the
APT configuration (minus leading
"Contents&minus;"). Example if the configuration
has the following snippets:

 Acquire::IndexTargets::deb::Contents&minus;deb { ... };
 Acquire::IndexTargets::deb&minus;src::Contents&minus;dsc { ... };
 Acquire::IndexTargets::deb::Contents&minus;udeb { ... };
 Acquire::IndexTargets::deb::Contents&minus;deb&minus;legacy {
    # Explicitly named to "Contents&minus;deb"
    Identifier "Contents&minus;deb";
    ...;
 };

Then, apt-file
will recognise "deb", "dsc" and
"udeb" as index names.

This option
defaults to the value of the
"apt&minus;file::Index&minus;Names" apt config
option (or "deb" if omitted).

&minus;i,
&minus;&minus;ignore&minus;case

Ignore case when searching for
pattern.

&minus;l,
&minus;&minus;package&minus;only

Only display package name; do
not display file names.

&minus;o, &minus;&minus;option
APT::Option=Value

Set a Configuration Option;
This will set an arbitrary configuration option. The syntax
is &minus;o APT::Option=Value. &minus;o and
&minus;&minus;option can be used multiple times to
set different options.

This option
can be used to overwrite other command line options
(e.g. "&minus;o
apt&minus;file::Search&minus;Filter::Origin=Debian" is
effectively the same as
"&minus;&minus;filter&minus;origins Debian").

Note that the
config options passed via this option will also be passed to
all APT tools called by apt-file.

&minus;&minus;substring&minus;match

Match if the given search
pattern is a substring of a path or package.

This is default
for search and find actions.

&minus;v,
&minus;&minus;verbose

Run apt-file in verbose/debug
mode.

&minus;x,
&minus;&minus;regexp

Treat pattern as a (perl)
regular expression. See perlreref(1) for details.
Without this option, pattern is treated as a literal string
to search for.

Be advised that
this option can be rather slow. If performance is an issue,
consider giving apt-file non-regex pattern matching too much
and pipe the output to perl &minus;ne
&rsquo;//&rsquo;. This enables
apt-file to use more optimizations and leaves less work to
the "slower" regex.

&minus;h,
&minus;&minus;help

Display a short help
screen.

CONFIGURATION FILES

The apt-file
command relies on the APT configuration.
Notably, the default configuration makes apt fetch
Contents files by default during a call to apt
update.

For information
on how to configure APT to fetch more or
fewer Contents files, please refer to
/usr/share/doc/apt&minus;file/README.md.gz.

The following
files are notably interesting: 
/etc/apt/apt&minus;file.conf

Note this path is actually
configurable by changing the value of the APT
configuration called
"Dir::Etc::apt&minus;file&minus;main". The listed
value is merely the default value of that option.

If this file is
present, apt-file will read this file after
all default APT configuration files. Any
config file &minus;c or option (&minus;o) will
be evaluated before this file (and can override
options set in it).

The file will
also be passed on to all APT tools called by
apt-file.

/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50apt&minus;file.conf

Chooses which Contents files to
download. Note that apt-file recognises only
"Acquire" targets that starts with
"Contents&minus;".

Special
configurations similar to apt-file 2 
Here are some apt-file 2 related work flows and how
to (almost) emulate them with apt-file 3. They are
documented as a starting point for people, who are
attached to these.

The emulation
may not be perfect for you out of the box. Patches are
welcome to keep the examples updated as long as the examples
remain "trivial".

&bull;

Only make apt-file update fetch Contents
files 

If you are
accustomed to apt update not fetching Contents
files, then you can run
/usr/share/doc/apt&minus;file/examples/apt&minus;file&minus;2&minus;update.sh.
This script will configure apt and apt-file
accordingly after best effort.

Please read the
resulting /etc/apt/apt&minus;file.conf.

&bull;

Creating/using "user"
caches 

Previous
versions of apt-file had a
"&minus;&minus;cache" option, which could be used
to denote a directory to store the Contents files. This can
be emulated by doing:

  # Setup
  $ mkdir &minus;p ~/.cache/apt&minus;file ~/.config
  $ touch ~/.cache/apt&minus;file/dpkg&minus;status
  $ sed '/^Dir::State/ d; /^Dir::Cache/ d;' \
    /usr/share/doc/apt&minus;file/examples/apt&minus;file.conf \
    > ~/.config/apt&minus;file.conf
  $ cat > ~/.config/apt&minus;file.conf
Dir::State "$HOME/.cache/apt&minus;file";
Dir::Cache "$HOME/.cache/apt&minus;file";
Dir::State::status "$HOME/.cache/apt&minus;file/dpkg&minus;status";
EOF
  # Update the cache
  $ apt&minus;file &minus;c ~/.config/apt&minus;file.conf update
  # Search using the cache
  $ apt&minus;file &minus;c ~/.config/apt&minus;file.conf show apt&minus;file
  # Removal of the cache + config
  $ rm &minus;fr ~/.cache/apt&minus;file ~/.config/apt&minus;file.conf

(You will
probably want to add an alias apt-file in your
~/.bashrc)

Please read the
resulting
./apt&minus;file&minus;user&minus;cache.conf.

BUGS, QUIRKS

There are some
known issues or "quirks" that are good to keep in
mind.

&bull;

The Contents files do not
include a leading slash on paths. This means that
/bin/ls is listed as bin/ls in the Contents
file. If you are looking for something in a top-level
directory, it is often better to omit the leading slash.

The search
algorithm will attempt to work around the leading slash, but
it will not work in all cases. As a workaround, try to pull
the leading slash to the beginning of regular expressions.
For example, use "/(?:usr/bin/vim|sbin/lvm)"
instead of "/usr/bin/vim|/sbin/lvm".

&bull;

When a new line has been added
to the sources.list and apt update has not been run,
apt-file does not print a warning message.

&bull;

By default, apt-file assumes that Contents files
do not include a descriptive header (explaining what
the file is and how to interpret it). However, some tools
have generated them with such a header (e.g. for old
versions of Contents files for the Debian archive or
Contents files generated by reprepro prior to version
5.2.0). 

If you search
such files, you will want to set
apt&minus;file::Parser::Check&minus;For&minus;Description&minus;Header
to true (e.g. in
/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50apt&minus;file.conf) to have
apt-file properly filter out the headers to avoid
false matches.

The reason this
is not the default is that it costs a factor 2 in overhead
while most common Contents files no longer have the header.
(see #881405 for more details).

&bull;

Not all APT
repositories have Contents files. Notably common install
media (CDs etc.) may omit them to conserve space.

The default
configuration by apt-file marks Contents files as
optional and will just silently fail to search in Contents
files in such repositories.

EXIT CODES

apt-file
has the following defined exit codes, which can be used for
scripting purposes.

0

apt-file returned
successfully. If the command was a search, there was at
least one result.

1

apt-file completed a search successfully, but it
had no results.

2

An error occurred (including invalid/conflicting user
options). 

3

apt-file could not complete the command because
the cache was empty. Please ensure there are indices enabled
in the APT config and run apt update
to fetch them.

4

apt-file could not complete the command because
the cache does not have any files matching the restrictions.
Either change the restrictions (e.g.
&minus;&minus;index&minus;names) or configure apt to
fetch the relevant files and run apt update.

255

There was an internal errors / uncaught exception in
apt-file. Please file a bug against
apt-file. 

Any other exit
code is reserved for future use.
