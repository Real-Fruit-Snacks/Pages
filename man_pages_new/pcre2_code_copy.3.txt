NAME

PCRE2 -
Perl-compatible regular expressions (revised API)

SYNOPSIS

#include

pcre2_code
*pcre2_code_copy(const pcre2_code
*code);

DESCRIPTION

This function
makes a copy of the memory used for a compiled pattern,
excluding any memory used by the JIT compiler. Without a
subsequent call to pcre2_jit_compile(), the copy can
be used only for non-JIT matching. The pointer to the
character tables is copied, not the tables themselves (see
pcre2_code_copy_with_tables()). The yield of the
function is NULL if code is NULL or if sufficient
memory cannot be obtained.

There is a
complete description of the PCRE2 native API in the
pcre2api page and a description of the POSIX API in
the pcre2posix page.
