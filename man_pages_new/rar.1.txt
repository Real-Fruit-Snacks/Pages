rar - archive
files with compression

SYNOPSIS

rar
 [- -]
archive [files...] [@listfiles...] [path_to_extract]

DESCRIPTION

This manual
page documents briefly the rar archiver. 
This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux
distribution because the original program does not have a
manual page. 
Commands and options described here are as of rar
7.00.

rar is a
program for creating and manipulating .rar archives.

COMMANDS

After the
program name comes a command and then optional switches with
dashes before them. 
A summary of commands is included below. For a complete
description, run rar -?

a

Add files to archive.

c

Add archive comment. Comment length is limited to 256
KB. 

ch

Change archive parameters. Can be used with most of
archive modification options.

cw

Write archive comment to a specified file.

d

Delete files from archive.

e

Extract files to current directory. Does not create any
subdirectories. 

f

Freshen files in archive. Updates those files changed
since they were packed to the archive. This command will not
add new to the archive.

k

Lock archive. Any command which intend to change the
archive will be ignored.

l[t[a],b]

List content of archive
[technical[all], bare]. 
&rsquo;lt&rsquo; displays the detailed file information in
multiline mode. Commands &rsquo;lt&rsquo;, &rsquo;lta&rsquo;
and &rsquo;lb&rsquo; are equal to &rsquo;vt&rsquo;,
&rsquo;vta&rsquo; and &rsquo;vb&rsquo; correspondingly.

m[f]

Move to archive [files only]. Directories will not be
removed if &rsquo;f&rsquo; modifier is used and/or
&rsquo;-ed&rsquo; switch is applied.

p

Print file to stdout.

r

Repair archive. For further details look in
rar.txt. 

rc

files). You need to specify any existing volume as the
archive name, for example, &rsquo;rar rc
backup.part03.rar&rsquo;. 

rn

Rename archived files.

rr[N]

Add data recovery record. Optionally, redundant
information (recovery record) may be added to an
archive. 

rv[N]

Create recovery volumes (.rev files), which can be later
used to reconstruct missing files in a volume set. This
command has sense only for multivolume archives. For further
details look in rar.txt.

s[name|-]

Convert archive to or from SFX.
The archive is merged with SFX-module in the user&rsquo;s
home directory.

t

Test archive files.

u

Update files in archive. Adds files not already in the
archive and updates files changed since they were packed to
the archive.

v[t[a],b]

Verbosely list archive
[technical]

x

Extract files with full path.

OPTIONS

NOTE:
Every switch must be separated by a whitespace. They cannot
be put together.

-?

Display help on commands and
switches. The same as when none or an illegal command line
option is entered.

--

This switch tells to RAR that there is no more switches
in the command line. It could be useful, if either archive
or file name starts from &rsquo;-&rsquo; character. Without
&rsquo;--&rsquo; switch such name would be treated as
switch. 

-@[+]

Disable [enable] file lists.

-ad[1,2]

Alternate destination path.

Generate archive name using the
current date and time. Appends the current date string to an
archive name when creating an archive. Useful for daily
backups. For further details look in rar.txt.

-ai

Ignore file attributes.

-am[s,r]

Archive name and time [save,
restore]

-ap

Set path inside archive. This
path is merged to file names when adding files to an archive
and removed from file names when extracting.

-as

Synchronize archive contents.

If this switch is used when
archiving, those archived files which are not present in the
list of the currently added files, will be deleted from
archive. It is convenient to use this switch in combination
with -u (update) to synchronize contents of an archive and
an archiving directory.

Disable reading configuration
and environment.

-cl

Convert file names to lower case.

Convert file names to upper case.

names.

-e[+]

Set file exclude [or include]
attributes.

-f

Freshen files. May be used with archive extraction or
creation.

headers. The password is case-sensitive. If you omit the
