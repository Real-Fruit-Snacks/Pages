NAME

pbmtoepson -
convert a PBM image into Epson printer graphics

SYNOPSIS

pbmtoepson

[-dpi=n]
[-protocol={escp9|escp}]
[-adjacent] [-nonadjacent]

[pbmfile]

DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

pbmtoepson
reads a PBM image as input and produces a stream of Epson
printer graphics as output.

The input is
from the file identified by the pbmfile argument or,
if you don&rsquo;t specify pbmfile, from Standard
Input. Output is to Standard Output.

The output is
for traditional (ca 1991) Epson 9-wire dot matrix (sometimes
called ESC/P 9-wire) printers or newer ESC/P printers. For a
more modern Epson ESC/P2 type printer, try
pbmtoescp2.

Before Netpbm
10.23 (July 2004), pbmtoepson could not produce ESC/P
streams -- only ESC/P 9-wire.

The Epson
printer protocols are described in Epson&rsquo;s protocol
specification.

Note that there
is no epsontopbm tool - this transformation is one way.

OPTIONS

In addition to
the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most
notably -quiet, see
 Common Options ),
pbmtoepson recognizes the following command line
options: 
-protocol={escp9|escp}

This determines which Epson
printer protocol the output uses. escp9 is the older
ESC/P 9-pin protocol. escp is the newer ESC/P
protocol. For the even newer ESC/P2 protocol, you
have to use pbmtoescp2 instead.

This option was
new in Netpbm 10.23 (July 2004).

-dpi=n

This specifies the horizontal print density in dots per
inch. The protocol allows only certain values: 60, 72, 80,
90, 120, 144, and 240. Actually, the ESC/P protocol allows a
few others, but pbmtoepson doesn&rsquo;t know how to
generate the command streams that use them.

If you
don&rsquo;t specify this, pbmtoepson chooses a
horizontal print density for you consistent with your other
options.

This option was
new in Netpbm 10.23 (July 2004).

-adjacent 
-nonadjacent

These options determine whether
the output uses "adjacent dot printing" or not,
whatever that is.

If you
don&rsquo;t specify this, pbmtoepson selects adjacent
dot printing unless that is incompatible with your other
options.

This option was
new in Netpbm 10.23 (July 2004).
