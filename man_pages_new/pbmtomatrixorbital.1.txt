DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

pbmtomatrixorbital
reads a PBM image as input and produces as output an image
that can be uploaded to a Matrix Orbital LCD display.

You can upload
the image to the LCD via the serial port to which it is
connected with the program mo-upload.pl, which you
can get from the package pbmtomatrixorbital. Yes, the
package is the same name as this Netpbm program, and it
contains its own pbmtomatrixorbital program which is
slightly different from this one because it is not part of
the Netpbm package.
