NAME

pwcheck &minus;
Cyrus password check daemon

SYNOPSIS

pwcheck

DESCRIPTION

Pwcheck
listens on the unix socket /var/state/pwcheck/pwcheck for
requests from clients for password verification. When a
request comes in, pwcheck uses it&rsquo;s elevated
privileges to check the user&rsquo;s credentials and returns
either OK on success or an error message on error.

It is normally
invoked by running it from an init script, but it can be
started at any time.
