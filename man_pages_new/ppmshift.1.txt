NAME

ppmshift -
shift lines of a PPM image left or right by a random
amount

SYNOPSIS

ppmshift
shift [ppmfile]

DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

ppmshift
reads a PPM image as input. It shifts every row of image
data to the left or right by a random amount, within a range
of shift pixels. The random distribution is uniform,
centered at zero movement.

The randomness
in the image is limited before Netpbm 10.37 (December 2006)
-- if you run the program twice in the same second, you may
get identical output.

This is an
effect the author intended to use for MPEG tests.
Unfortunately, this program is not useful for that - it
creates too random patterns to be used for animations.
Still, it might give interesting results on still
images.

OPTIONS

There are no
command line options defined specifically for
ppmshift, but it recognizes the options common to all
programs based on libnetpbm (See
 Common Options
.)

EXAMPLE

Check this out:
Save your favorite model&rsquo;s picture from something like
alt.binaries.pictures.supermodels (ok, or from any other
picture source), convert it to ppm, and process it e.g. like
this, assuming the picture is 800x600 pixels:

#take the upper
half, and leave it like it is 
pamcut -top=0 -width=800 -height=300 cs.ppm
>upper.ppm

#take the lower
half, flip it upside down, dim it and distort it a little

pamcut -top=300 -width=800 -height=300 cs.ppm | \ 
pamflip -topbottom | \ 
ppmdim 0.7 | \ 
ppmshift 10 >lower.ppm

#and
concatenate the two pieces 
pamcat -topbottom upper.ppm lower.ppm >newpic.ppm

The resulting
picture looks like the image being reflected on a water
surface with slight ripples.
