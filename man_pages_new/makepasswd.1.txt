DESCRIPTION

makepasswd
generates true random passwords using /dev/urandom, with the
emphasis on security over pronounceability. It can also
encrypt plaintext passwords given on the command line.

OPTIONS

--chars
N

Generate passwords with exactly
N characters (do not use with options --minchars and
--maxchars).

--clearfrom FILE

Use password from FILE instead
of generating passwords. Requires the --crypt or the
--crypt-md5 options; may not be used with these options:
--chars, --maxchars, --minchars, --count, --string,
--nocrypt. Trailing newlines are removed but other white
space is not.

--count N

Produce a total of N passwords
(the default is one).

--crypt

Produce encrypted
passwords.

--crypt-md5

Produce encrypted passwords
using the MD5 digest (hash) algorithm.

--cryptsalt N

Use crypt() salt N, a positive
number 

--help

Ignore other operands and produce only a help
display. 

--maxchars N

Generate passwords with at most
N characters (default = 10).

--minchars N

Generate passwords with at
least N characters (default = 8).

--nocrypt

Do not encrypt the generated
password(s) (the default).

--noverbose

Display no labels on output
(the default).

--randomseed N

Use random number seed N,
between 0 and 2^32 inclusive. A zero value results in a
real-random seed. This generates much less secure passwords
than the default; not only does it generate predictable
passwords due to the fixed seed, but the range of available
seeds is 32 bits rather than the default of 256 bits, and
cannot be changed without breaking expectations of previous
users of this option. If possible, do not use this
option.

--rerandom N

Set the random seed value every
N values used. Specify zero to use a single seed value (the
default). Specify one to get true-random passwords, though
note that doing this too frequently will deplete the supply
of entropy available in the kernel&rsquo;s entropy pool.

--repeatpass N

Use each password N times (4096
maximum, --crypt must be set and --cryptsalt may not be
set).

--string STRING

Use the characters in STRING to
generate random passwords.

--verbose

Display labelling information
on output.

HISTORY

makepasswd
was originally part of the mkircconf program used to
centrally administer the Linux Internet Support Cooperative
IRC network. It may potentially be of use in any situation
where passwords must be secure and need not be memorized by
humans.

Colin Watson
modified it to use Bytes::Random::Secure.
