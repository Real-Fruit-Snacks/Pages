SYNOPSIS

yum
shell [filename]

DESCRIPTION

yum
includes an interactive shell for conducting multiple
commands or sets of commands during a single execution of
yum. These commands can be issued manually or passed to yum
from a file. The commands are much the same as the normal
yum command line options. See here yum(8) for that
information. There are a few additional commands documented
below.

config

[argument] [value]

args: debuglevel, errorlevel,
obsoletes, gpgcheck, assumeyes, exclude 
If no value is given it prints the current value. 
If value is given it sets that value.

repo

[argument] [option]

list: lists repositories and
their status 
enable: enable repositories. option = repository id 
disable: disable repositories. option = repository id

transaction

[argument] 
list: lists the contents of the transaction 
reset: reset (zero-out) the transaction 
solve: run the dependency solver on the transaction 
run: run the transaction

Examples

The following
are examples of using the yum shell.

list available
packagename* 
groupinfo &rsquo;Some Group&rsquo; 
install foo 
remove bar 
update baz 
run

That will list
available packages matching the glob
&rsquo;packagename*&rsquo;. It will return information on
the group &rsquo;Some Group&rsquo; It will then queue the
following commands into the transaction: install foo, remove
bar, update baz. Then the &rsquo;run&rsquo; command will
resolve dependencies for the transaction commands and run
the transaction.
