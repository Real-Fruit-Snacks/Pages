NAME

pbmtoxbm -
convert a PBM image to an X11 bitmap

SYNOPSIS

pbmtoxbm

[{-x10|-x11}]

[pbmfile]

DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

pbmtoxbm
reads a PBM image as input and produces an X10 or X11 bitmap
as output.

OPTIONS

In addition to
the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most
notably -quiet, see
 Common Options ),
pbmtoxbm recognizes the following command line
options:

-x10

This option causes pbmtoxbm to generate the X10
version of XBM.

You may not
specify this with -x11.

This option was
new with Netpbm 10.37 (December 2006). Before that, use
pbmtox10bm instead.

-x11

This option causes
pbmtoxbm to generate the X11 version of XBM.

You may not
specify this with -x10.

The X11 version
is the default, so this option has no effect.

This option was
new with Netpbm 10.37 (December 2006).
