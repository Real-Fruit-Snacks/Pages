NAME

pgmtexture -
calculate textural features on a PGM image

SYNOPSIS

pgmtexture

[-d
d]

[pgmfile]

DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

pgmtexture
reads a PGM image as input and calculates textural features
based on spatial dependence matrices at 0, 45, 90, and 135
degrees for a distance d (default = 1).

Textural
features include:

&bull;

Angular Second Moment

&bull;

Contrast

&bull;

Correlation

&bull;

Variance

&bull;

Inverse Difference Moment

&bull;

Sum Average

&bull;

Sum Variance

&bull;

Sum Entropy

&bull;

Entropy

&bull;

Difference Variance

&bull;

Difference Entropy

&bull;

Information Measures of Correlation

&bull;

Maximal Correlation Coefficient

OPTIONS

In addition to
the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most
notably -quiet, see
 Common Options ),
pgmtexture recognizes the following command line
option: 
-d distance

The distance. Default is 1.

LIMITATIONS

The method for
finding the Maximal Correlation Coefficient, which requires
finding the second largest eigenvalue of a matrix Q, does
not always converge.
