explicit_bzero(3bsd) LOCAL explicit_bzero(3bsd)

NAME

explicit_bzero &mdash;
write zeroes to a byte string

LIBRARY

Utility functions from BSD
systems (libbsd, -lbsd)

SYNOPSIS

#include 

(See libbsd(7) for include usage.)

void

explicit_bzero(void *buf,
size_t len);

DESCRIPTION

The explicit_bzero()
function writes len zero bytes to the string
buf. If len is zero, explicit_bzero()
does nothing.

The
explicit_bzero() variant behaves the same as the
bzero() function, but will not be removed by a
compiler&rsquo;s dead store optimization pass, making it
useful for clearing sensitive memory such as a password.

SEE ALSO

bzero(3), memset(3), swab(3)

HISTORY

The explicit_bzero()
function first appeared in OpenBSD 5.5, glibc 2.25.
