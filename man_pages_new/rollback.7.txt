NAME

ROLLBACK
&minus; abort the current transaction

SYNOPSIS

ROLLBACK [ WORK
| TRANSACTION ]

DESCRIPTION

ROLLBACK
rolls back the current transaction and causes all the
updates made by the transaction to be discarded.

PARAMETERS

WORK

TRANSACTION

Optional key words. They have
no effect.

NOTES

Use COMMIT
[commit(7)] to successfully terminate a
transaction.

Issuing
ROLLBACK when not inside a transaction does no harm,
but it will provoke a warning message.

EXAMPLES

To abort all
changes:

ROLLBACK;

COMPATIBILITY

The SQL
standard only specifies the two forms ROLLBACK and ROLLBACK
WORK. Otherwise, this command is fully conforming.
