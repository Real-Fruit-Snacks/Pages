NAME

ypserv - NIS
Server

SYNOPSIS

/usr/sbin/ypserv
[-d [path]] [-p port]

DESCRIPTION

The Network
Information Service (NIS) provides a simple network lookup
service consisting of databases and processes. The databases
are gdbm files in a directory tree rooted at
/var/yp.

The
ypserv daemon is typically activated at system
startup. ypserv runs only on NIS server machines with
a complete NIS database. On other machines using the NIS
services, you have to run ypbind as client or under
Linux you could use the libc with NYS support. ypbind
must run on every machine which has NIS client processes;
ypserv may or may not be running on the same node,
but must be running somewhere on the network. On startup
ypserv parses the file /etc/ypserv.conf.

OPTIONS

-d,
--debug [path]

Causes the server to run in
debugging mode. Normally, ypserv reports only errors
(access violations, dbm failures) using the syslog(3)
facility. In debug mode, the server does not background
itself and prints extra status messages to stderr for each
request that it revceives. path is an optionally
parameter. ypserv is using this directory instead of
/var/yp

-p,
--port port

ypserv will bind itself
to this port. This makes it possible to have a router filter
packets to the NIS ports, so that access to the NIS server
from hosts on the Internet can be restricted.

-v,
--version

Prints the version number

SECURITY

In general, any
remote user can issue an RPC to ypserv and retrieve
the contents of your NIS maps, if he knows your domain name.
To prevent such unauthorized transactions, ypserv
supports a feature called securenets which can be
used to restrict access to a given set of hosts. At startup
ypserv will attempt to load the securenets
information from a file called /var/yp/securenets . This
file contains entries that consist of a netmask and a
network pair separated by white spaces or network/number of
bits of netmask entries. One per line. Lines starting with
&ldquo;#&rdquo; are considered to be comments.

A sample
securenets file might look like this:

# allow
connections from local host -- necessary 
host 127.0.0.1 
host ::1 
# same as 255.255.255.255 127.0.0.1 
# 
# allow connections from any host 
# on the 131.234.223.0 network 
255.255.255.0 131.234.223.0 
# allow connections from any host 
# between 131.234.214.0 and 131.234.215.255 
255.255.254.0 131.234.214.0 
# allow some IPv6 connections 
FE80::0202:B3FF::/96 
# allow IPv6 connections from all machines 
::/0

If
ypserv receives a request from an address that fails
to match a rule, the request will be ignored and a warning
message will be logged. If the /var/yp/securenets file does
not exist, ypserv will allow connections from any
host.

In the
/etc/ypserv.conf you could specify some access rules for
special maps and hosts. But it is not very secure, it makes
the life only a little bit harder for a potential hacker. If
a mapname doesn't match a rule, ypserv will look for the
YP_SECURE key in the map. If it exists, ypserv will only
allow requests on a reserved port.

For security
reasons, ypserv will only accept ypproc_xfr requests for
updating maps from the same master server as the old one.
This means, you have to reinstall the slave servers if you
change the master server for a map.

The Network
Information Service (NIS) was formerly known as Sun Yellow
Pages (YP). The functionality of the two remains the same;
only the name has changed. The name Yellow Pages is a
