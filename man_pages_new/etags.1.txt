DESCRIPTION

The
etags program is used to create a tag table file, in
a format understood by emacs(1); the
ctags program is used to create a similar table in a
format understood by vi(1). Both forms of the
program understand the syntax of C, Objective C, C++, Java,
Fortran, Ada, Cobol, Erlang, Forth, HTML, LaTeX, Emacs
Lisp/Common Lisp, Lua, Makefile, Pascal, Perl, PHP,
Postscript, Python, Prolog, Scheme and most
assembler&minus;like syntaxes. Both forms read the files
specified on the command line, and write a tag table
(defaults: TAGS for etags, tags for
ctags) in the current working directory. Files
specified with relative file names will be recorded in the
tag table with file names relative to the directory where
the tag table resides. If the tag table is in /dev or is the
standard output, however, the file names are made relative
to the working directory. Files specified with absolute file
names will be recorded with absolute file names. Files
generated from a source file&minus;&minus;like a C file
generated from a source Cweb file&minus;&minus;will be
recorded with the name of the source file. Compressed files
are supported using gzip and bzip2. The programs recognize
the language used in an input file based on its file name
and contents. The &minus;&minus;language switch can
be used to force parsing of the file names following the
switch according to the given language, overriding guesses
based on filename extensions.

OPTIONS

Some options
make sense only for the vi style tag files produced
by ctags; etags does not recognize them. The programs
accept unambiguous abbreviations for long option names.

&minus;a, &minus;&minus;append

Append to existing tag file.
(For vi-format tag files, see also
&minus;&minus;update.)

&minus;B,
&minus;&minus;backward&minus;search

Tag files written in the format
expected by vi contain regular expression search
instructions; the &minus;B option writes them using
the delimiter &rsquo;?&rsquo;, to search
backwards through files. The default is to use the
delimiter &rsquo;/&rsquo;, to search forwards
through files. Only ctags accepts this option.

&minus;&minus;declarations

In C and derived languages,
create tags for function declarations, and create tags for
extern variables unless &minus;&minus;no&minus;globals is
used.

&minus;D,
&minus;&minus;no&minus;defines

Do not create tag entries for C
preprocessor constant definitions and enum constants. This
may make the tags file much smaller if many header files are
tagged.

&minus;&minus;globals

Create tag entries for global
variables in Perl and Makefile. This is the default in C and
derived languages.

&minus;&minus;no&minus;globals

Do not tag global variables in
C and derived languages. Typically this reduces the file
size by one fourth.

&minus;i file,
&minus;&minus;include=file

Include a note in the tag file
indicating that, when searching for a tag, one should also
consult the tags file file after checking the current
file. Only etags accepts this option.

&minus;I,
&minus;&minus;ignore&minus;indentation

Don&rsquo;t rely on indentation
as much as we normally do. Currently, this means not to
assume that a closing brace in the first column is the final
brace of a function or structure definition in C and
C++.

&minus;l
language,
&minus;&minus;language=language

Parse the following files
according to the given language. More than one such options
may be intermixed with filenames. Use
&minus;&minus;help to get a list of the available
languages and their default filename extensions. The
&rsquo;auto&rsquo; language can be used to restore automatic
detection of language based on the file name. The
&rsquo;none&rsquo; language may be used to disable language
parsing altogether; only regexp matching is done in this
case (see the &minus;&minus;regex option).

&minus;&minus;members

Create tag entries for
variables that are members of structure-like constructs in
PHP. This is the default for C and derived languages.

&minus;&minus;no&minus;members

Do not tag member
variables.

&minus;&minus;packages&minus;only

Only tag packages in Ada
files.

&minus;&minus;parse&minus;stdin=file

May be used (only once) in
place of a file name on the command line. etags will
read from standard input and mark the produced tags as
belonging to the file FILE.

&minus;o tagfile,
&minus;&minus;output=tagfile

Explicit name of file for tag
table; for etags only, a file name of &minus; means
standard output; overrides default TAGS or
tags. (But ignored with &minus;v or
&minus;x.)

&minus;r regexp,
&minus;&minus;regex=regexp

Make tags based
on regexp matching for the files following this option, in
addition to the tags made with the standard parsing based on
language. May be freely intermixed with filenames and the
&minus;R option. The regexps are cumulative, i.e.
each such option will add to the previous ones. The regexps
are of one of the forms:

[{language}]/tagregexp/[nameregexp/]modifiers 

@regexfile

where
tagregexp is used to match the tag. It should not
match useless characters. If the match is such that more
characters than needed are unavoidably matched by
tagregexp, it may be useful to add a
nameregexp, to narrow down the tag scope.
ctags ignores regexps without a nameregexp.
The syntax of regexps is the same as in emacs. The following
character escape sequences are supported: \a, \b, \d, \e,
\f, \n, \r, \t, \v, which respectively stand for the ASCII
characters BEL, BS, DEL, ESC, FF, NL, CR, TAB, VT. 
The modifiers are a sequence of 0 or more characters
among i, which means to ignore case when matching;
m, which means that the tagregexp will be
matched against the whole file contents at once, rather than
line by line, and the matching sequence can match multiple
lines; and s, which implies m and means that
the dot character in tagregexp matches the newline
char as well. 
The separator, which is / in the examples, can be any
character different from space, tab, braces and @. If
the separator character is needed inside the regular
expression, it must be quoted by preceding it with \.

The optional {language} prefix means
that the tag should be created only for files of language
language, and ignored otherwise. This is particularly
useful when storing many predefined regexps in a file. 
In its second form, regexfile is the name of a file
that contains a number of arguments to the
&minus;&minus;regex= option, one per line. Lines
beginning with a space or tab are assumed to be comments,
and ignored.

Here are some
examples. All the regexps are quoted to protect them from
shell interpretation.

Tag the DEFVAR
macros in the emacs source files: 
&minus;&minus;regex=&rsquo;/[ \t]*DEFVAR_[A-Z_
\t(]+"\([^"]+\)"/&rsquo;

Tag VHDL files
(this example is a single long line, broken here for
formatting reasons): 

&minus;&minus;language=none &minus;&minus;regex=&rsquo;/[ \t]*\(ARCHITECTURE\|\
CONFIGURATION\) +[^ ]* +OF/&rsquo; &minus;&minus;regex=&rsquo;/[ \t]*\
\(ATTRIBUTE\|ENTITY\|FUNCTION\|PACKAGE\( BODY\)?\
\|PROCEDURE\|PROCESS\|TYPE\)[ \t]+\([^ \t(]+\)/\3/&rsquo;

Tag TCL files
(this last example shows the usage of a tagregexp):

&minus;&minus;lang=none
&minus;&minus;regex=&rsquo;/proc[ \t]+\([^ \t]+\)/\1/&rsquo;

A regexp can be
preceded by {lang}, thus restricting it to match
lines of files of the specified language. Use etags
&minus;&minus;help to obtain a list of the recognized
languages. This feature is particularly useful inside
regex files. A regex file contains one regex per
line. Empty lines, and those lines beginning with space or
tab are ignored. Lines beginning with @ are references to
regex files whose name follows the @ sign. Other lines are
considered regular expressions like those following
&minus;&minus;regex. 
For example, the command 
etags &minus;&minus;regex=@regex.file *.c 
reads the regexes contained in the file regex.file.

&minus;R,
&minus;&minus;no&minus;regex

Don&rsquo;t do any more regexp
matching on the following files. May be freely intermixed
with filenames and the &minus;&minus;regex
option.

&minus;u,
&minus;&minus;update

Update tag entries for
files specified on command line, leaving tag entries
for other files in place. Currently, this is implemented by
deleting the existing entries for the given files and then
rewriting the new entries at the end of the tags file. It is
often faster to simply rebuild the entire tag file than to
use this. Only ctags accepts this option.

&minus;v,
&minus;&minus;vgrind

Instead of generating a tag
file, write index (in vgrind format) to standard
output. Only ctags accepts this option.

&minus;x,
&minus;&minus;cxref

Instead of generating a tag
file, write a cross reference (in cxref format) to
standard output. Only ctags accepts this option.

&minus;h, &minus;H,
&minus;&minus;help

Print usage information.
Followed by one or more &minus;&minus;language=LANG prints
detailed information about how tags are created for
LANG.

&minus;V,
&minus;&minus;version

Print the current version of
the program (same as the version of the emacs etags
is shipped with).
