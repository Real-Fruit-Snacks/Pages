Description

gdiffmk
compares two roff(7) documents, file1 and
file2, and creates a roff document consisting
of file2 with added margin character (.mc)
requests indicating output lines that differ from
file1. If the file1 or file2 argument
is &ldquo;-&rdquo;, gdiffmk reads the standard
input stream for that input. If the output operand is
present, gdiffmk writes output to a file of that
name. If it is &ldquo;-&rdquo; or absent,
gdiffmk writes output to the standard output stream.
&ldquo;-&rdquo; cannot be both an input and output
operand.

Options

--help
displays a usage message and --version shows version
information; both exit afterward. 
-a add-mark

Use add-mark for source
lines not in file1 but present in file2.
Default: &ldquo;+&rdquo;.

-B

By default, the deleted texts marked by the -D
option end with an added roff break request,
.br, to ensure that the deletions are marked
properly. This is the only way to guarantee that deletions
and small changes get flagged. This option directs the
program not to insert these breaks; it makes no sense to use
it without -D.

-c change-mark

Use change-mark for
changed source lines. Default: &ldquo;|&rdquo;.

-d delete-mark

Use the delete-mark for
deleted source lines. Default: &ldquo;*&rdquo;.

-D

Show the deleted portions from changed and deleted
text. 

-M mark1
mark2

Change the delimiting marks for
the -D option. It makes no sense to use this option
without -D. Default delimiting marks:
&ldquo;[[&rdquo; ... &ldquo;]]&rdquo;.

-x diff-command

Use the diff-command
command to perform the comparison of file1 and
file2. In particular, diff-command should
accept the GNU diff(1) -D option. Default:
diff.

--

Treat all subsequent arguments as file names, even if
they begin with &ldquo;-&rdquo;.

Bugs

The output is
not necessarily compatible with all macro packages and all
preprocessors. A workaround that often overcomes
preprocessor problems is to run gdiffmk on the output
of all the preprocessors instead of the input source.

gdiffmk
relies on the -D option of GNU diff to make a
merged &ldquo;#ifdef&rdquo; output format. Busybox
diff is known to not support it. Also see the
-x diff-command option.
