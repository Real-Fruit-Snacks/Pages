NAME

mate-wm - Start
the window manager configured by the user

SYNOPSIS

mate-wm
[--default-wm=WINDOWMANAGER] [--sm-client-id=ID]

DESCRIPTION

The
mate-wm program starts the window manager configured
by the user. If the user has not chosen a window manager it
will launch a MATE compliant window manager.

USAGE

The user can
define his preferred window manager with the
/org/mate/desktop/session/required-components/windowmanager
dconf key. The value of this key should be the name of the
desktop file of the desired window manager, without its
.desktop extension. If this key is set to
mate-wm, then mate-wm will simply look for an
appropriate window manager. The user can also override the
selection of a window manager by setting the
WINDOW_MANAGER environment variable.

If the
--default-wm option is used, mate-wm will use
WINDOWMANAGER as window manager if the
WINDOW_MANAGER environment variable is not set and if
the
/org/mate/desktop/session/required-components/windowmanager
dconf key does not define a specific window manager, or if
the configured window manager cannot be found.

The
--sm-client-id option is translated to an appropriate
option depending on which window manager will be
started.

OPTIONS

The following
options are supported: 
--default-wm=WINDOWMANAGER

Define the default window
manager to start if no window manager is configured, or if
the configured window manager cannot be found.

--sm-client-id=ID

Specify the session management
ID when connecting to the session manager.

ENVIRONMENT

mate-wm
uses the value of the WINDOW_MANAGER environment
variable to let the user override the configured window
manager.
