NAME

config.guess -
guess the build system triplet

SYNOPSIS

config.guess
[OPTION]

DESCRIPTION

The GNU build
system distinguishes three types of machines, the
&rsquo;build&rsquo; machine on which the compilers are run,
the &rsquo;host&rsquo; machine on which the package being
built will run, and, exclusively when you build a compiler,
assembler etc., the &rsquo;target&rsquo; machine, for which
the compiler being built will produce code.

This script
will guess the type of the &rsquo;build&rsquo; machine.

Output the
configuration name of the system &rsquo;config.guess&rsquo;
is run on.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

config.guess
might need to compile and run C code, hence it needs a
compiler for the &rsquo;build&rsquo; machine: use the
environment variable &rsquo;CC_FOR_BUILD&rsquo; to specify
the compiler for the build machine. If
&rsquo;CC_FOR_BUILD&rsquo; is not specified,
&rsquo;CC&rsquo; will be used. Be sure to specify
&rsquo;CC_FOR_BUILD&rsquo; is &rsquo;CC&rsquo; is a
cross-compiler to the &rsquo;host&rsquo; machine.

CC_FOR_BUILD a
native C compiler, defaults to &rsquo;cc&rsquo; 
CC a native C compiler, the previous variable is
preferred
