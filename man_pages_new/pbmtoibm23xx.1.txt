NAME

pbmtoibm23xx -
convert a PBM image to IBM 23XX printer stream

SYNOPSIS

pbmtoibm23xxx
-xres=dpi -yres=dpi [slow
[pbmfile ...]

Minimum unique
abbreviation of option is acceptable. You may use double
hyphens instead of single hyphen to denote options. You may
use white space in place of the equals sign to separate an
option name from its value.

DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

pbmtoibm23xx
reads one or more PBM files as input and writes an IBM 23XX
printer command stream to generate all the images in all the
files to Standard Output.

If you
don&rsquo;t specify any file names, pbmtoibm23xx
reads from Standard Input.

OPTIONS

In addition to
the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most
notably -quiet, see
 Common Options ),
pbmtoibm23xx recognizes the following command line
options: 
-xres=dpi

This option specifies the
horizontal resolution in dots per inch. Valid values are 60,
120, and 240.

This option is
mandatory.

-yres=dpi

This option specifies the
vertical resolution in dots per inch. Valid values are 60,
120, and 240.

This option is
mandatory.

-slow

Use the slower printing mode where two modes with the
same resolution are available. This usually produces better
quality prints. This affects only modes with horizontal
resolution 120, but might affect other modes in future
versions of the program.

LIMITATIONS

There are
probably better ways to control the IBM 23XX printers. Let
me know if you find any.
