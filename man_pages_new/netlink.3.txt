int len);

DESCRIPTION

defines several standard macros to access or create a
netlink datagram. They are similar in spirit to the macros
defined in cmsg(3) for auxiliary data. The buffer
passed to and from a netlink socket should be accessed using
only these macros. 
NLMSG_ALIGN()

Round the length of a netlink
message up to align it properly.

NLMSG_LENGTH()

Given the payload length,
len, this macro returns the aligned length to store
in the nlmsg_len field of the nlmsghdr.

NLMSG_SPACE()

Return the number of bytes that
a netlink message with payload of len would
occupy.

NLMSG_DATA()

Return a pointer to the payload
associated with the passed nlmsghdr.

NLMSG_NEXT()

Get the next nlmsghdr in
a multipart message. The caller must check if the current
nlmsghdr didn&rsquo;t have the NLMSG_DONE
set&mdash;this function doesn&rsquo;t return NULL on end.
The len argument is an lvalue containing the
remaining length of the message buffer. This macro
decrements it by the length of the message header.

NLMSG_OK()

Return true if the netlink
message is not truncated and is in a form suitable for
parsing.

NLMSG_PAYLOAD()

Return the length of the
payload associated with the nlmsghdr.

CONFORMING TO

These macros
are nonstandard Linux extensions.

NOTES

It is often
better to use netlink via libnetlink than via the
low-level kernel interface.
