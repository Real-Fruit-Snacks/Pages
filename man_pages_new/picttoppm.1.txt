NAME

picttoppm -
convert a Macintosh PICT file to a PPM

SYNOPSIS

picttoppm

[-verbose=n]

[-fullres]

[-noheader]

[-quickdraw]
[-fontdir file]

[pictfile]

DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

picttoppm
reads a PICT file (version 1 or 2) and outputs a PPM
image.

PICT is an
image format that was developed by Apple Computer in 1984 as
the native format for Macintosh graphics. A PICT image is
encoded in QuickDraw commands. The PICT format is a
meta-format that can be used for both bitmap images and
vector images. PICT is also known as "Macintosh
Picture" format, or the QuickDraw Picture format.

PICT files are
primarily used to exchange graphics between various
Macintosh applications.

In MacOS X, PDF
replaces PICT as the main graphics format.

OPTIONS

In addition to
the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most
notably -quiet, see
 Common Options ),
picttoppm recognizes the following command line
options: 
-fontdir file

Make the list of BDF fonts in
file available for use by picttoppm when
drawing text. See below for the format of the fontdir file.
This is in addition to the built-in fonts and those in the
file fontdir.

-fullres

Force any images in the PICT
file to be output with at least their full resolution. A
PICT file may indicate that a contained image is to be
scaled down before output. This option forces images to
retain their sizes and prevent information loss. This option
disables all PICT operations except images.

-noheader

Do not assume the first 512
bytes of the file are a header. All PICT files have such a
header, but this is useful when you have PICT data that was
not stored in the data fork of a PICT file.

-quickdraw

Execute only pure quickdraw
operations. In particular, turn off the interpretation of
special PostScript printer operations.

-verbose=n

Print a whole bunch of
information about the PICT file and the conversion process
that only picttoppm hackers really care about.

n is the
verbosity level, 0-2.

Before Netpbm
10.98 (March 2022), this option is a flag option that you
specify multiple times to specify increasing verbosity.

LIMITATIONS

The PICT file
format is a general drawing format. picttoppm does
not recognize all the drawing commands, but it does fully
implement all image commands and mostly implements line,
rectangle, polygon and text drawing. It is useful for
converting scanned images and some drawing conversion.

With
-fullres, picttoppm ignores text drawing
commands. Beginning in Netpbm 10.45 (December 2008), it
issues a warning message when it omits text for this
reason.

FONTS

Some of the
information in a PICT file is text, with a number indicating
the font in which the text is supposed to rendered.
picttoppm has one built-in font, but you can add
others by directing picttoppm to BDF font files,
which you do with font directory files.

picttoppm
automatically uses the file named fontdir in the
current directory, if it exists. You may specify an
additional font directory file with the -fontdir
option.

Obviously the
font definitions are strongly related to the Macintosh. You
can find more font numbers and information about fonts in
Macintosh documentation.

Font
Directory File Format 
Each line in the file is either a comment or font
information. A comment begins with #. The font
information consists of 4 whitespace separated fields. The
first is the font number, the second is the font size in
pixels, the third is the font style and the fourth is the
name of a BDF file containing the font. The BDF format is
defined by the X Window System and is beyond the scope of
this document.

The font number
indicates the type face. Here is a list of known font
numbers and their faces.

The font style
indicates a variation on the font. Multiple variations may
apply to a font and the font style is the sum of the
variation numbers which are:
