NAME

sane-hp4200 -
SANE backend for Hewlett-Packard 4200 scanners

DESCRIPTION

The
sane-hp4200 library implements a SANE (Scanner Access
Now Easy) backend that provides access to the following
Hewlett-Packard USB flatbed scanners:

ScanJet 4200 C

ScanJet 4200 Cxi 
ScanJet 4200 Cse

More details
can be found on the hp4200 backend homepage
http://hp4200-backend.sourceforge.net/.

This is BETA
software. Keep your hand at the scanner&rsquo;s plug and
unplug it, if the head bumps at the end of the scan
area.

If you own a
scanner other than the ones listed above that works with
this backend, please let us know this by sending the
scanner&rsquo;s exact model name and the USB vendor and
device ids (e.g. from /proc/bus/usb/devices,
sane-find-scanner or syslog) to us. Even if the
scanner&rsquo;s name is only slightly different from the
models mentioned above, please let us know.

CONFIGURATION

The contents of
the hp4200.conf file is a list of usb lines
containing vendor and product ids that correspond to USB
scanners. The file can also contain the names of device
files that correspond to an HP 4200 scanner. Empty lines and
lines starting with a hash mark (#) are ignored. The
scanners are autodetected by usb vendor_id product_id
statements which are already included into
hp4200.conf. "vendor_id" and
"product_id" are hexadecimal numbers that identify
the scanner. If autodetection does not work, add the device
name of your scanner to the configuration file, e.g.
/dev/usb/scanner0.

FILES

/etc/sane.d/hp4200.conf

The backend configuration file
(see also description of SANE_CONFIG_DIR below).

/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-hp4200.a

The static library implementing
this backend.

/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-hp4200.so

The shared library implementing
this backend (present on systems that support dynamic
loading).

ENVIRONMENT

SANE_CONFIG_DIR

This environment variable
specifies the list of directories that may contain the
configuration file. Under UNIX, the directories are
separated by a colon (&rsquo;:&rsquo;), under OS/2, they are
separated by a semi-colon (&rsquo;;&rsquo;). If this
variable is not set, the configuration file is searched in
two default directories: first, the current working
directory (".") and then in /etc/sane.d. If the
value of the environment variable ends with the directory
separator character, then the default directories are
searched after the explicitly specified directories. For
example, setting SANE_CONFIG_DIR to
"/tmp/config:" would result in directories
"tmp/config", ".", and
"/etc/sane.d" being searched (in this order).

SANE_DEBUG_HP4200

If the library was compiled
with debug support enabled, this environment variable
controls the debug level for this backend. Higher debug
levels increase the verbosity of the output.

Example: export
SANE_DEBUG_HP4200=4

BUGS

Tested only
with Linux.

Only 8 bit
color mode works.

Scanning is
slow due to backtracking.
