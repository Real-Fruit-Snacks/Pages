NAME

git-mailsplit -
Simple UNIX mbox splitter program

SYNOPSIS

git
mailsplit [-b] [-f] [-d]
[--keep-cr] [--mboxrd] 
-o [--]
[(|)...]

DESCRIPTION

Splits a mbox
file or a Maildir into a list of files: "0001"
"0002" .. in the specified directory so you can
process them further from there.

Important

Maildir splitting relies upon filenames being sorted to
output patches in the correct order.

OPTIONS

Mbox file to split. If not
given, the mbox is read from the standard input.

Root of the Maildir to
split. This directory should contain the cur, tmp and new
subdirectories.

-o

Directory in which to
place the individual messages.

-b

If any file doesn&rsquo;t
begin with a From line, assume it is a single mail message
instead of signaling error.

-d

Instead of the default 4
digits with leading zeros, different precision can be
specified for the generated filenames.

-f

Skip the first 
numbers, for example if -f3 is specified, start the
numbering with 0004.

--keep-cr

Do not remove \r
from lines ending with \r\n.

--mboxrd

Input is of the
"mboxrd" format and "^>+From " line
escaping is reversed.
