DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

pnmalias
reads a PNM image as input, and applies anti-aliasing to
background and foreground pixels. If the input file is a
PBM, pnmalias promotes the output anti-aliased image
to a PGM, and prints a message informing the user of the
change in format.

OPTIONS

In addition to
the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most
notably -quiet, see
 Common Options ),
pnmalias recognizes the following command line
options:

-bgcolor
colorb sets the background color the
colorb.

-fgcolor
colorf sets the foreground color to
colorf.

Pixels with
these values will be anti-aliased. By default,
pnmalias takes the background color to be black, and
foreground color to be white.

Specify the
color (color) as described for the
argument of the
pnm_parsecolor() library routine .

Note that even
when dealing with PGMs, background and foreground colors
need to be specified in the fashion described above. In this
case, pnmalias takes the background and foreground
pixel values to be the value of the red component for the
specified color.

-bonly
says to apply anti-aliasing only to the background
pixels.

-fonly
says to apply anti-aliasing only to the foreground
pixels.

-balias
says to apply anti-aliasing to all pixels surrounding
background pixels.

-falias
says to apply anti-aliasing to all pixels surrounding
foreground pixels.

If you specify
neither -balias nor -falias, pnmalias
applies anti-aliasing only among neighboring background and
foreground pixels.

-weight
w says to use w as the central weight for the
aliasing filter. w must be a real number in the range
0 w w is,
the "blurrier" the output image is. The default is
w = 1/3.
