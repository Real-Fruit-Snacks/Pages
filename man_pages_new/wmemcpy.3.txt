wmemcpy - copy
an array of wide-characters

SYNOPSIS

#include

wchar_t
*wmemcpy(wchar_t *dest, const wchar_t
*src, size_t n);

DESCRIPTION

The
wmemcpy() function is the wide-character equivalent
of the memcpy(3) function. It copies n wide
characters from the array starting at src to the
array starting at dest.

The arrays may
not overlap; use wmemmove(3) to copy between
overlapping arrays.

The programmer
must ensure that there is room for at least n wide
characters at dest.

RETURN VALUE

wmemcpy()
returns dest.
