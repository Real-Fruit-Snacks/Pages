NAME

yuvsplittoppm -
convert separate Y, U, and V files into a PPM image

SYNOPSIS

yuvsplittoppm

basename
width height [-ccir601]

DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

yuvsplittoppm
reads three files, containing the YUV components, as input.
These files are basename.Y, basename.U, and
basename.V. Produces a PPM image on Standard
Output.

Since the YUV
files are raw files, the dimensions width and
height must be specified on the command line.

OPTIONS

In addition to
the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most
notably -quiet, see
 Common Options ),
yuvsplittoppm recognizes the following command line
option: 
-ccir601

Assumes that the YUV triplets
are scaled into the smaller range of the CCIR 601 (MPEG)
standard. Else, the JFIF (JPEG) standard is assumed.
