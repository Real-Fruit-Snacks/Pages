NAME

unwrapdiff -
demangle word-wrapped patches

SYNOPSIS

unwrapdiff [-v]
[file...] 

unwrapdiff {[--help] |
[--version]} 

DESCRIPTION

unwrapdiff
demangles patches that have been word-wrapped, in an attempt
to make them useful.

The corrected
diff is sent to standard output. Note that you will probably
need to use the -l option when applying the patch, in
order to ignore any whitespace differences there may be.

OPTIONS

-v

Verbose operation. A list of
lines that are modified in a way that might be wrong is sent
to stderr.

--help

Display a short usage
message.

--version

Display the version number of
unwrapdiff.

LIMITATIONS

Some heuristics
are used to decide whether use a space to recombine a
wrapped line, or just join them together. Currently this is
done by comparing with last three characters of a line with
the first two characters of its continuation, and using a
space if any of them are different.

The patch needs
to have been valid before being word-wrapped.

The last line
of a hunk is nearly always ambiguous. If the next line
begins &ldquo;@@&rdquo;, &ldquo;Index: &rdquo;,
&ldquo;diff &rdquo; or &ldquo;--- &rdquo; then it
is taken to be complete; otherwise it is unwrapped using the
next line.
