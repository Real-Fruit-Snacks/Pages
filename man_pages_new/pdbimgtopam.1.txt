DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

pdbimgtopam
reads a Palm Pilot Image Viewer image (and Image record in a
PDB file) as input, from Standard Input or palmfile,
and produces a PAM image as output.

If the Pilot
image is monochrome, the PAM output has maxval 1. Otherwise,
it has maxval 255. Note that Pilot images are always
monochrome. The PAM image has tuple type GRAYSCALE.

the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most
notably -quiet, see
 Common Options ),
pdbimgtopam recognizes the following command line
options: 
-verbose

Display various interesting
information about the input file and process.

-notefile=filename

to the specified file.

If you
don&rsquo;t specify this, pdbimgtopam ignores any
image note.
