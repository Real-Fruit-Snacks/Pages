NAME

pgmdeshadow -
Deshadow a PGM image

SYNOPSIS

pgmdeshadow

[pnmfile]

DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

pgmdeshadow
removes gray shadows from an image. This is useful for an
image containing text, such as a scanned book pages, where a
shadow typically appears near the book crease or near one
side of the image. pgmdeshadow recognizes a gray
shadow as an area of smoothly changing color, starting from
the outer edges of the image. The program uses a simple
image reconstruction algorithm to determine the local shadow
gray level, then divides each pixel&rsquo;s gray level by
the local shadow gray level.

The algorithm
is the "fast hybrid grayscale reruction" algorithm
from Luc Vincent, "Morphological Grayscale Reruction in
Image Analysis: Applications and Efficient Algorithms.

OPTIONS

There are no
command line options defined specifically for
pgmdeshadow, but it recognizes the options common to
all programs based on libnetpbm (See
 Common Options
.)
