NAME

cryptoflex-tool
- utility for manipulating Schlumberger Cryptoflex data
structures

SYNOPSIS

cryptoflex-tool
[OPTIONS] 

DESCRIPTION

cryptoflex-tool
is used to manipulate PKCS data structures on Schlumberger
Cryptoflex smart cards. Users can create, list and read PINs
and keys stored on the smart card. User PIN authentication
is performed for those operations that require it.

OPTIONS

--app-df
num, -a num

Specifies the DF to operate
in

--create-key-files
arg, -c arg

Creates new RSA key files for
arg keys

--create-pin-files
id, -P id

Creates new PIN file for
CHVid

--exponent
exp, -e exp

Specifies the RSA exponent,
exp, to use in key generation. The default value is
3.

--generate-key,
-g

Generate a new RSA key pair

--key-num
num, -k num

Specifies the key number to
operate on. The default is key number 1.

--list-keys,
-l

Lists all keys stored in a
public key file

--modulus-length
length, -m length

Specifies the modulus
length to use in key generation. The default value is
1024.

--prkey-file
id, -p id

Specifies the private key file
id, id, to use

--pubkey-file
id, -u id

Specifies the public key file
id, id, to use

--read-key,
-R

Reads a public key from the
card, allowing the user to extract and store or use the
public key

--reader
arg, -r arg

Number of the reader to use. By
default, the first reader with a present card is used. If
arg is an ATR, the reader with a matching card will
be chosen.

--verbose,
-v

Causes cryptoflex-tool
to be more verbose. Specify this flag several times to
enable debug output in the opensc library.

--verify-pin,
-V

Verifies CHV1 before issuing
commands

--wait,
-w

Causes cryptoflex-tool
to wait for a card insertion.
