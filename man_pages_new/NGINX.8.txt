NGINX(8) BSD System Manager&rsquo;s Manual NGINX(8)

NAME

nginx &mdash; HTTP and
reverse proxy server, mail proxy server

SYNOPSIS

nginx [-?hqTtVv]
[-c file] [-e file]
[-g directives]
[-p prefix]
[-s signal]

DESCRIPTION

nginx (pronounced
&ldquo;engine x&rdquo;) is an HTTP and reverse proxy server,
a mail proxy server, and a generic TCP/UDP proxy server. It
is known for its high performance, stability, rich feature
set, simple configuration, and low resource consumption.

The options are
as follows:

-?, -h

Print help.

-c file

Use an
alternative configuration file.

-e file

Use an
alternative error log file. Special value
stderr indicates that the standard error output
should be used.

-g directives

Set global
configuration directives. See EXAMPLES for
details.

-p prefix

Set the prefix
path. The default value is /usr/share/nginx.

-q

Suppress
non-error messages during configuration testing.

-s signal

Send a signal
to the master process. The argument signal can be one
of: stop, quit, reopen, reload.
The following table shows the corresponding system
signals:

stop

SIGTERM

quit

SIGQUIT

reopen

SIGUSR1

reload

SIGHUP

-T

Same as
-t, but additionally dump configuration files to
standard output.

-t

Do not run,
just test the configuration file. nginx checks the
configuration file syntax and then tries to open files
referenced in the configuration file.

-V

Print the
nginx version, compiler version, and configure
script parameters.

-v

Print the
nginx version.

SIGNALS

The master process of
nginx can handle the following signals:

SIGINT, SIGTERM

Shut down
quickly.

SIGHUP

Reload
configuration, start the new worker process with a new
configuration, and gracefully shut down old worker
processes.

SIGQUIT

Shut down
gracefully.

SIGUSR1

Reopen log
files.

SIGUSR2

Upgrade the
nginx executable on the fly.

SIGWINCH

Shut down
worker processes gracefully.

While there is
no need to explicitly control worker processes normally,
they support some signals too:

SIGTERM

Shut down
quickly.

SIGQUIT

Shut down
gracefully.

SIGUSR1

Reopen log
files.

DEBUGGING LOG

To enable a debugging log,
reconfigure nginx to build with debugging:

./configure
--with-debug ...

and then set the
debug level of the error_log:

error_log
/path/to/log debug;

It is also
possible to enable the debugging for a particular IP
address:

events {

debug_connection 127.0.0.1;

}

ENVIRONMENT

The NGINX environment variable
is used internally by nginx and should not be set
directly by the user.

FILES 
/run/nginx.pid

Contains the process ID of
nginx. The contents of this file are not sensitive,
so it can be world-readable.

/etc/nginx/nginx.conf

The main configuration
file.

stderr

Error log
file.

EXIT STATUS

Exit status is 0 on success, or
1 if the command fails.

EXAMPLES

Test configuration file
~/mynginx.conf with global directives for PID and
quantity of worker processes:

nginx -t -c
~/mynginx.conf \

-g "pid /var/run/mynginx.pid; worker_processes
2;"
