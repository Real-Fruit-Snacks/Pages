NAME

vimdiff - edit
two, three or four versions of a file with Vim and show
differences

SYNOPSIS

vimdiff
[options] file1 file2 [file3 [file4]]

gvimdiff

DESCRIPTION

Vimdiff
starts Vim on two (or three or four) files. Each file
gets its own window. The differences between the files are
highlighted. This is a nice way to inspect changes and to
move changes from one version to another version of the same
file.

See vim(1) for
details about Vim itself.

When started as
gvimdiff the GUI will be started, if available.

In each window
the &rsquo;diff&rsquo; option will be set, which causes the
differences to be highlighted. 
The &rsquo;wrap&rsquo; and &rsquo;scrollbind&rsquo; options
are set to make the text look good. 
The &rsquo;foldmethod&rsquo; option is set to
"diff", which puts ranges of lines without changes
in a fold. &rsquo;foldcolumn&rsquo; is set to two to make it
easy to spot the folds and open or close them.

OPTIONS

Vertical splits
are used to align the lines, as if the "-O"
argument was used. To use horizontal splits instead, use the
"-o" argument.

For all other
arguments see vim(1).
