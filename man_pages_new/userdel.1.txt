NOTES

The
userdel utility only deletes an account definition
that is in the local /etc/group, /etc/passwd,
/etc/shadow, and /etc/user_attr file. file. If
a network name service such as NIS or NIS+ is
being used to supplement the local /etc/passwd file
with additional entries, userdel cannot change
information supplied by the network name service.
