NAME

cryptdisks_start
- wrapper around cryptsetup that parses /etc/crypttab.

SYNOPSIS

cryptdisks_start

DESCRIPTION

cryptdisks_start
is a wrapper around cryptsetup that parses
/etc/crypttab just like the initscript
/etc/init.d/cryptdisks does and starts the dm-crypt mapping
that corresponds to .

Note that this
wrapper passes --key-file=- to cryptsetup, so
the passphrase in any referenced key file must not be
followed by a newline character.

SEE ALSO

cryptdisks_stop(8),
cryptsetup(8), crypttab(5)
