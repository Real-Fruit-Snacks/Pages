NAME

ppmtowinicon -
convert PPM image into a Windows .ico file

SYNOPSIS

ppmtowinicon

[-andpgms]

[-output=output.ico]

[ppmfile
[andfile] ...]

DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

This program is
essentially obsolete; The newer pamtowinicon is
better.

ppmtowinicon
reads one or more PPM images as input and produces a
Microsoft Windows .ico file as output.

A Windows icon
contains 1 or more images, at different resolutions and
color depths. When Windows wants to display the icon, it
searches through the images to find the one that best
matches the number of colors and resolution of the
display.

Microsoft
recommends including at least the following formats in each
icon.

&bull;

16 x 16 - 4 bpp

&bull;

32 x 32 - 4 bpp

&bull;

48 x 48 - 8 bpp

If you
don&rsquo;t specify any input files, input is from Standard
Input.

Output is to
Standard Output unless you specify -output.

Transparency

If you specify the -andmask option, you get (partly)
transparent icons. In that case, your arguments are pairs of
file names, with the first file name being that of the image
and the second file name being that of a standard Netpbm PGM
transparency mask (see the pgm format
specification(1)).

In a .ico file,
there is no such thing as partial transparency
(translucency). Where the PGM mask says completely opaque,
the icon will be opaque. Everywhere else, the icon will be
transparent. Note that as with any Netpbm program, you can
use a PBM image for the transparency mask and
ppmtowinicon will treat it like a PGM.

The and mask is
like a transparency mask, except for what it signifies in
the "not opaque" areas. In the usual case, the
foreground image is black in those areas, and in that case
the areas are fully transparent -- the background shows
through the icon. But in general, a not opaque pixel
signifies that the background and foreground should be
merged as follows: The intensities of the color components
in the foreground and background are represented as binary
numbers, then corresponding bits of the background and
foreground intensities are exclusive-or&rsquo;ed together.
So there is a sort of reverse video effect.

If you
don&rsquo;t want this special effect and instead want
straightforward transparency, use the
-truetransparent option. This causes
ppmtowinicon to make the base image black everywhere
your transparency mask says transparent, regardless of what
color your input image is at that location.

If you
don&rsquo;t specify -andmask, ppmtowinicon
puts all-opaque and masks into the .ico file.

OPTIONS

In addition to
the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most
notably -quiet, see
 Common Options ),
ppmtowinicon recognizes the following command line
options: 
-andpgms

Include transparency
information in the icons. See the
transparency section .

-output=output.ico

Name of output file. By
default, ppmtowinicon writes the icon to Standard
Output.

-truetransparent

Make transparency in the icon
normal instead of the special reverse video effect. See the
transparency section .
