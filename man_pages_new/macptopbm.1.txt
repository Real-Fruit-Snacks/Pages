NAME

macptopbm -
convert a MacPaint file into a PBM image

SYNOPSIS

macptopbm
[-extraskip N] [macpfile]

DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

macptopbmreads
a MacPaint file as input and produces a PBM image as
output.

OPTIONS

In addition to
the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most
notably -quiet, see
 Common Options ),
macptopbm recognizes the following command line
option:

You can
abbreviate any option to its shortest unique prefix. 
-extraskip

This option is to get around a
problem with some methods of transferring files from the Mac
world to the Unix world. Most of these methods leave the Mac
files alone, but a few of them add the
"finderinfo" data onto the front of the Unix file.
This means an extra 128 bytes to skip over when reading the
file. The symptom to watch for is that the resulting PBM
file looks shifted to one side. If you get this, try
-extraskip 128, and if that still doesn&rsquo;t look
right try another value.
