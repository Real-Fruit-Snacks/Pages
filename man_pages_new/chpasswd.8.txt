NAME

chpasswd -
update passwords in batch mode

SYNOPSIS

chpasswd
[options] 

DESCRIPTION

The
chpasswd command reads a list of user name and
password pairs from standard input and uses this information
to update a group of existing users. Each line is of the
format:

user_name:password

By default the
passwords must be supplied in clear-text, and are encrypted
by chpasswd. Also the password age will be updated,
if present.

By default,
passwords are encrypted by PAM, but (even if not
recommended) you can select a different encryption method
with the -e, -m, or -c options.

Except when PAM
is used to encrypt the passwords, chpasswd first
updates all the passwords in memory, and then commits all
the changes to disk if no errors occurred for any user.

When PAM is
used to encrypt the passwords (and update the passwords in
the system database) then if a password cannot be updated
chpasswd continues updating the passwords of the next
users, and will return an error code on exit.

This command is
intended to be used in a large system environment where many
accounts are created at a single time.

OPTIONS

The options
which apply to the chpasswd command are:

-c,
--crypt-method METHOD

Use the specified method to
encrypt the passwords.

The available
methods are DES, MD5, SHA256,
SHA512, YESCRYPT and NONE if your libc
supports these methods.

By default, PAM
is used to encrypt the passwords.

-e,
--encrypted

Supplied passwords are in
encrypted form.

-h,
--help

Display help message and
exit.

-m,
--md5

Use MD5 encryption instead of
DES when the supplied passwords are not encrypted.

-R,
--root CHROOT_DIR

Apply changes in the
CHROOT_DIR directory and use the configuration files
from the CHROOT_DIR directory. Only absolute paths
are supported.

-P,
--prefix PREFIX_DIR

Apply changes to configuration
files under the root filesystem found under the directory
PREFIX_DIR. This option does not chroot and is
intended for preparing a cross-compilation target. Some
limitations: NIS and LDAP users/groups are not verified. PAM
authentication is using the host files. No SELINUX
support.

-s,
--sha-rounds ROUNDS

Use the specified number of
rounds to encrypt the passwords.

You can only
use this option with crypt method: SHA256 SHA512
YESCRYPT

By default, the
number of rounds for SHA256 or SHA512 is defined by the
SHA_CRYPT_MIN_ROUNDS and SHA_CRYPT_MAX_ROUNDS variables in
/etc/login.defs.

A minimal value
of 1000 and a maximal value of 999,999,999 will be enforced
for SHA256 and SHA512. The default number of rounds is
5000.

By default, the
number of rounds for YESCRYPT is defined by the
YESCRYPT_COST_FACTOR in /etc/login.defs.

A minimal value
of 1 and a maximal value of 11 will be enforced for
YESCRYPT. The default number of rounds is 5.

CAVEATS

Remember to set
permissions or umask to prevent readability of unencrypted
files by other users.

CONFIGURATION

The following
configuration variables in /etc/login.defs change the
behavior of this tool:

SHA_CRYPT_MIN_ROUNDS
(number), SHA_CRYPT_MAX_ROUNDS (number)

When ENCRYPT_METHOD is
set to SHA256 or SHA512, this defines the
number of SHA rounds used by the encryption algorithm by
default (when the number of rounds is not specified on the
command line).

With a lot of
rounds, it is more difficult to brute force the password.
But note also that more CPU resources will be needed to
authenticate users.

If not
specified, the libc will choose the default number of rounds
(5000), which is orders of magnitude too low for modern
hardware.

The values must
be inside the 1000-999,999,999 range.

If only one of
the SHA_CRYPT_MIN_ROUNDS or
SHA_CRYPT_MAX_ROUNDS values is set, then this value
will be used.

If
SHA_CRYPT_MIN_ROUNDS >
SHA_CRYPT_MAX_ROUNDS, the highest value will be
used.

Note: This only
affect the generation of group passwords. The generation of
user passwords is done by PAM and subject to the PAM
configuration. It is recommended to set this variable
consistently with the PAM configuration.

YESCRYPT_COST_FACTOR
(number)

When ENCRYPT_METHOD is
set to YESCRYPT, this defines the cost factor used by
the encryption algorithm by default (when the cost factor is
not specified on the command line).

With a high
cost factor, it is more difficult to brute force the
password. But note also that more CPU resources will be
needed to authenticate users.

The value must
be inside the 1-11 range.

Note: This only
affect the generation of group passwords. The generation of
user passwords is done by PAM and subject to the PAM
configuration. It is recommended to set this variable
consistently with the PAM configuration.
