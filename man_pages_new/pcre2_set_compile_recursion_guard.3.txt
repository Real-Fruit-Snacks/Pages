NAME

PCRE2 -
Perl-compatible regular expressions (revised API)

SYNOPSIS

#include

int
pcre2_set_compile_recursion_guard(pcre2_compile_context
*ccontext, 
int (*guard_function)(uint32_t, void *), void
*user_data);

DESCRIPTION

This function
defines, within a compile context, a function that is called
whenever pcre2_compile() starts to compile a
parenthesized part of a pattern. The first argument to the
function gives the current depth of parenthesis nesting, and
the second is user data that is supplied when the function
is set up. The callout function should return zero if all is
well, or non-zero to force an error. This feature is
provided so that applications can check the available system
stack space, in order to avoid running out. The result of
pcre2_set_compile_recursion_guard() is always
zero.

There is a
complete description of the PCRE2 native API in the
pcre2api page and a description of the POSIX API in
the pcre2posix page.
