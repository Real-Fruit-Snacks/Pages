DESCRIPTION

The
printers.conf file is the system printing
configuration database. System administrators use
printers.conf to describe destinations for the print
client commands and the print protocol adaptor. A
destination names a printer or class of printers (see
lpadmin(1M)). The LP print spooler uses
private LP configuration data for represented in the
printers.conf database.

Entries

Each entry in printers.conf describes one
destination. Entries are one line consisting of any number
of fields separated by colons (&rsquo;:&rsquo;) and
terminated by a NEWLINE. The first field of each entry
specifies the name of the destination and aliases to which
the entry describes. Specify one or more names or aliases of
the destination in this first field. Specify the destination
using atomic names. POSIX-style names are not acceptable.
See standards(5). Separate destination names by pipe
signs (&rsquo;|&rsquo;).

Two destination
names are reserved for special use in the first entry. Use
_all to specify the interest list for lpget,
lpstat, and cancel. Use _default to
specify the default destination.

The remaining
fields in an entry are key=value pairs.
See Specifying Configuration Options for details
regarding key=value pairs.

Empty lines can
be included for readability. Entries may continue on to
multiple lines by adding a backslash
(&rsquo;\&rsquo;) as the last character in the line.
printers.conf can include comments. Comments have a
pound sign (&rsquo;#&rsquo;) as the first character
in the line, and are terminated by a NEWLINE. Use the
lpset command to create or modify
printers.conf (see lpset(1M)). Do not make
changes in printers.conf using an
editor.

Specifying
Configuration Options 
key=value pairs are configuration options
defined by the system administrator. key and
value may be of arbitrary length. Separate key
and value by the equal (&rsquo;=&rsquo;)
character.

Client/Server
Configuration Options

The following
client/server configuration options (represented as
key=value pairs) are supported: 
bsdaddr=server,
destination[,Solaris]

Sets the server and destination
name. Sets if the client generates protocol extensions for
use with the lp command (see lp(1)).
Solaris specifies a Solaris print server extension.
If Solaris is not specified, no protocol extensions
are generated. server is the name of the host
containing the queue for destination.
destination is the atomic name by which the server
knows the destination.

use=destination

Sets the destination to
continue searching for configuration information.
destination is an atomic or Federated Naming Service
(FNS) (.../service/printer/...) name.

all=destination_list

Sets the interest list for the
lpget, lpstat, and cancel commands.
destination_list is a comma-separated list of
destinations. Specify destination using atomic or
FNS names
(.../service/printer/...). See
lpget(1M), lpstat(1), and
cancel(1).

General
Server Options

The following
general server configuration options (represented as
key=value pairs) are supported: 
spooling-type=spooler[, version]

Sets the type of spooler under
which a destination is configured. Dynamically loads
translation support for the back-end spooling system from
/usr/lib/print/bsd-adaptor/bsd_spooler.so[.version].
Specify spooler as lpsched, cascade, or
test. lpsched is used as a default for locally
attached destinations. cascade is used as a default
for destination spooled on a remote host. Use test
for the test module to allow the capture of print requests.
If using a versioned spooler module, version
specifies the version of the translation module.

spooling-type-path=
dir_list

Sets the location of
translation support for the type of spooler defined by the
spooling-type key. Locates translation support for
the for the type of spooler under which a destination is
configured. dir_list is a comma-separated list of
absolute pathnames to the directories used to locate
translation support for the spooling system set by the
spooling-type key.

LP Server
Options

The following
LP configuration options (represented as
key=value pairs) are supported: 
user-equivalence=true|false

Sets whether or not usernames
are considered equivalent when cancelling a print request
submitted from a different host in a networked environment.
true means that usernames are considered equivalent,
and permits users to cancel a print requests submitted from
a different host. user-equivalence is set to
false by default. false means that usernames
are not considered equivalent, and does not permit users
cancel a print request submitted from a different host. If
user-equivalence is set to false, print
requests can only be cancelled by the users on the host on
whichs the print prequest was generated or by the super-user
on the print server.

Test
Configuration Options

The following
test configuration options (represented as
key=value pairs) are supported: 
test-spooler-available=true|false

Sets whether or not the
protocol adaptor accepts connection requests to the test
adaptor for the destination. true means that the
protocol adaptor accepts connection requests to the test
adaptor for the destination. test-spooler-available
is set to true by default. false means that
the protocol adaptor does not accept connection requests to
the test adaptor for the destination.

test-log=dir

Sets the location of the log
file generated by the test translation module. Specify
dir as an absolute pathname.

test-dir=dir

Sets the directory to be used
during execution of the test translation module. Specify
dir as an absolute pathname.

test-access=true|false

Sets whether or not the
requesting client has access to the test translation module.
true means that the requesting client has access to
the test translation module. test-access is set to
true by default. false means that the the
requesting client does not have access to the test
translation module.

test-accepting=true|false

Sets whether or not the
configured destination is accepting job submission requests.
true means that the configured destination is
accepting job submission requests. test-accepting is
set to true by default. false means that the
configured destination is not accepting job submission
requests.

test-restart=true|false

Sets whether or not a protocol
request to restart the destination will be honored or return
an error. true means that a protocol request to
restart the destination will be honored. test-restart
is set to true by default. false means that a
protocol request to restart the destination return an
error.

test-submit=true|false

Sets whether or not a protocol
request to submit a job to a destination will be honored or
return an error. true means that a protocol request
to submit a job to a destination will be honored.
test-submit is set to true by default.
false means that a protocol request to submit a job
to a destination will not be honored.

test-show-queue-file=
file

Sets the name of the file whose
contents are to be returned as the result of a status query.
Specify file as an absolute pathname.

test-cancel-cancel-file=
file

Sets the name of the file whose
contents are returned as the result of a cancellation
request. Specify file as an absolute pathname.

Locating
Destination Information 
The print client commands and the print protocol adaptor
locate destination information based on the
"printers" database entry in the
/etc/nsswitch.conf file. See
nsswitch.conf(4).

Locating the
Personal Default Destination

The default
destination is located differently depending on the
command.

The lp
command locates the default destination in the following
order:

1.

lp command&rsquo;s -d destination
option. 

2.

LPDEST environment variable.

3.

PRINTER environment variable.

4.

_default destination in
$HOME/.printers. 

5.

_default destination in
/etc/printers.conf. 

6.

_default destination in FNS.

The lpr,
lpq, and lprm commands locate the default
destination in the following order:

1.

lpr command&rsquo;s
-P destination option.

2.

PRINTER environment variable.

3.

LPDEST environment variable.

4.

_default destination in
$HOME/.printers. 

5.

_default destination in
/etc/printers.conf. 

6.

_default destination in FNS.

Locating the
Interest List for lpstat, lpget, and cancel

The
lpget, lpstat, and cancel commands
locate the interest list in the following order:

1.

_all list in
$HOME/.printers. 

2.

_all list in /etc/printers.conf.

3.

_all list in FNS.

Looking Up
Destinations Using Atomic Names and FNS 
Federated Naming Service (FNS) supports resolution of
composite names spanning multiple naming systems.
FNS supports several underlying naming services:
NIS+, NIS, and files.

Atomic
destination names are resolved using the search order
specified by the "printers" database entry in the
/etc/nsswitch.conf file. When the "xfn"
service is configured in the "printers" database,
the following Federated Name Service contexts are searched
for the supplied name:

thisuser/service/printer,

myorgunit/service/printer,

EXAMPLES

Example 1:
Setting the interest list

The following
entry sets the interest list for the lpget,
lpstat and cancel commands to printer1,
printer2 and printer3:

_all:all=printer1,printer2,printer3

Example 2:
Setting the server name

The following
entry sets the server name to server and and printer
name to ps_printer for destinations printer1
and ps. It does not generate protocol extensions.

printer1|ps:bsdaddr=server,ps_printer

Example 3:
Setting server name and destination name

The following
entry sets the server name to server and destination
name to pcl_printer, for destination printer2.
It also generates Solaris protocol extensions.

printer2:bsdaddr=server,pcl_printer,Solaris

Example 4:
Setting server name and destination name with continuous
search

The following
entry sets the server name to server and destination
name to new_printer, for destination printer3.
It also sets the printer3 to continue searching for
configuration information to printer
another_printer.

printer3:bsdaddr=server,new_printer:use=another_printer

Example 5:
Setting default destination

The following
entry sets the default destination to continue searching for
configuration information to destination
printer1.

_default:use=printer1
