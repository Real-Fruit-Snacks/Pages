NAME

smbios-type-11
- SMBIOS Type 11 strings

SYNOPSIS

/sys/firmware/dmi/entries/11-*/raw

DESCRIPTION

Various OS
components process SMBIOS Type 11 vendor strings that a
virtual machine manager (VMM) may set and a virtual machine
(VM) receives. SMBIOS Type 11 vendor strings may play a
similar role as kernel-command-line(1) parameters but
generally are under control of the VMM rather than the boot
loader or UKI.

For details on
SMBIOS Type 11 see the System
Management BIOS
[1]
specifications.

STRINGS

The
following strings are supported:

io.systemd.credential:CREDENTIAL=VALUE,
io.systemd.credential.binary:CREDENTIAL=VALUE

This
allows passing additional system credentials into the
system, in textual or binary (Base64) form. See
systemd.exec(5) and
System and Service
Credentials
[2]
for details.

Added
in version 252.

io.systemd.stub.kernel-cmdline-extra=CMDLINE

This
allows configuration of additional kernel command line
options, and is read by the kernel UEFI stub. For details
see systemd-stub(1).

Added
in version 254.

io.systemd.boot.kernel-cmdline-extra=CMDLINE

This
allows configuration of additional kernel command line
options for Boot Loader Specification Type 1 entries, and is
read by systemd-boot. For details see
systemd-boot(1).

Added
in version 256.
