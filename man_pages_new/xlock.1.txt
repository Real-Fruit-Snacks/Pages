DESCRIPTION

xlock
locks the X server till the user enters their password at
the keyboard. While xlock is running, all new server
connections are refused. The screen saver is disabled. The
mouse cursor is turned off. The screen is blanked and a
changing pattern is put on the screen. If a key or a mouse
button is pressed then the user is prompted for the password
of the user who started xlock.

If the correct
password is typed, then the screen is unlocked and the X
server is restored. When typing the password Control-U and
Control-H are active as kill and erase respectively. To
return to the locked screen, click in the small icon version
of the changing pattern.

In the lower
part of the password screen a text is displayed. This
message is taken from the first file of the following that
exists: $HOME/.xlocktext, $HOME/.plan, or
$HOME/.signature.

On systems
which support new BSD style authentication, the password may
be prefixed by an authentication style followed by a colon
(i.e. "style:password"). See the login.conf(5) for
more information on authentication styles.

NOTE ON ETIQUETTE

Xlock
should not be used on public terminals when there is a high
demand for them.

If you find a
public terminal that has been locked by another user and
there are no other terminals available, and the terminal
appears to have been left idle for a while (normally more
than 15 minutes), it is fair to try to reset the session in
some manner.

&minus;delay usecs

The delay option sets
the speed at which a mode will operate. It simply sets the
number of microseconds to delay between batches of
animations. In blank mode, it is important to set this to
some small number of seconds, because the keyboard and mouse
are only checked after each delay, so you cannot set the
delay too high, but a delay of zero would needlessly consume
cpu checking for mouse and keyboard input in a tight loop,
since blank mode has no work to do.

apollonian, blot, braid, bug, clock, crystal, daisy, deco,
demon, dilemma, discrete, dragon, eyes, flag, flow, forest,
galaxy, helix, hop, hyper, ico, laser, life, life1d, life3d,

petri, tetris, voters, wator, and wire. In pipes it is the
maximum length of a system. In flow and swarm it is the
length of the lines. In atlantis it is the shark size. A
negative number allows for randomness, similar to
count. In atunnels, fire, gears, sballs and
sproingies it is the size of the screen (default 400), this
is because on many slow systems it runs too slow when the
picture covers the full screen. Set to 0 for full screen on
fast machines.

&minus;ncolors num

The ncolors option sets
the maximum number of colors to be used.

&minus;saturation value

The saturation option
sets saturation of the color ramp used to value . 0
is grayscale and 1 is very rich color. 0.4 is a nice
pastel.

&minus;erasemode modename

As of this writing there are
over 12 erase modes supported (if its not chosen its assumed
random). The erase modes are random_lines, random_squares,
venetian, triple_wipe, quad_wipe, circle_wipe,
three_circle_wipe, squaretate, fizzle, spiral, slide_lines,
losira, no_fade. modename is now similar to the
option modelist where you can it can be something
like "all-losira" to get all erasemodes but
losira. Use a "+" or a "," to add modes
like "spiral+venetian".

&minus;erasedelay usecs

The erasedelay option
sets the number of microseconds for steps of the
erasemode (a setting of 0 and the erasemode is
bypassed).

+/-nolock

The nolock option causes
xlock to only draw the patterns and not lock the
display. A key press or a mouse click will terminate the
screen saver.

-/+inwindow

Runs xlock in a window,
so that you can iconify, move, or resize it and still use
your screen for other stuff. When running in a window,
xlock no longer locks your screen, it just looks
good.

-/+inroot

Runs xlock in your root
window. Like the inwindow option it no longer locks
the screen, it just looks good.

-/+remote

The remote option tells
xlock to not stop you from locking remote X11
servers. This option should be used with care and is
intended mainly to lock X11 terminals which cannot run
xlock locally. If you lock someone else&rsquo;s
workstation, they will have to know your password to
unlock it. Using +remote overrides any resource
derived values for remote and prevents xlock
from being used to lock other X11 servers. (Use
&rsquo;+&rsquo; instead of &rsquo;-&rsquo; to override
resources for other options that can take the
&rsquo;+&rsquo; modifier similarly.)

-/+mono

The mono option causes
xlock to display monochrome, (black and white) pixels
rather than the default colored ones on color displays.

-/+allowaccess

This option is required for
servers which do not allow clients to modify the host access
control list. It is also useful if you need to run x clients
on a server which is locked for some reason... When
allowaccess is true, the X11 server is left open for
clients to attach and thus lowers the inherent security of
this lock screen. A side effect of using this option is that
if xlock is killed -KILL, the access control list is
not lost.

&minus;vtlock modename

This option is used on a
XFree86 system to manage VT switching in
[off|noswitch|switch|restore] mode.

off

means no VT switch locking.

switch

means VT switch locking + switching to xlock VT when
activated. 

restore

means VT switch locking + switching to xlock VT when
activated + switching back to previous VT when
desactivated. 

noswitch

means VT switch locking only when xlock VT is
active. 

-/+allowroot

The allowroot option
allows the root password to unlock the server as well as the
user who started xlock. May not be able to turn this
on and off depending on your system and how xlock was
configured.

-/+debug

Allows xlock to be
debugged by doing all but locking the screen.

-/+description

The description option
causes xlock shows a mode description above password
window. The default is to show this description.

-/+echokeys

The echokeys option
causes xlock to echo &rsquo;*&rsquo; characters
(default) for each key typed into the password prompt. Some
consider this a security risk, so the default is to not echo
anything.

&minus;echokey echokey

The text character to use for
echo key in echokeys .

-/+enablesaver

By default xlock will
disable the normal X server&rsquo;s screen saver since it is
in effect a replacement for it. Since it is possible to set
delay parameters long enough to cause phosphor burn on some
displays, this option will turn back on the default screen
saver which is very careful to keep most of the screen
black.

-/+resetsaver

By default xlock will
call XResetScreenSaver. This may be undesirable with DPMS
monitors.

-/+grabmouse

The grabmouse option
causes xlock to grab the mouse and keyboard, this is
the default. xlock can not lock the screen without
this.

-/+grabserver

The grabserver option
causes xlock to grab the server. This is not usually
needed but some unsecure X servers can be defeated without
this.

-/+install

Allows xlock to install
its own colormap if xlock runs out of colors. May not
work on with some window managers (fvwm) and does not work
with the -inroot option.

-/+mousemotion

Allows you to turn on and off
the sensitivity to the mouse to bring up the password
window.

-/+sound

Allows you to turn on and off
sound if installed with the capability.

-/+timeelapsed

Allows you to find out how long
a machine is locked so you can complain to an administrator
that someone is hogging a machine.

-/+usefirst

The usefirst option
causes xlock to use the keystroke which got you to
the password screen as the first character in the password.
The default is to ignore the first key pressed.

-/+verbose

Verbose mode, tells what
options it is going to use.

&minus;nice nicelevel

The nice option sets
system nicelevel of the xlock process to nicelevel
.

&minus;lockdelay seconds

The lockdelay option
sets the number of seconds before the screen needs a
password to be unlocked. Good for use with an autolocking
mechanism like xautolock(1).

&minus;timeout seconds

The timeout option sets
the number of seconds before the password screen will
time out.

&minus;font fontname

The font option sets the
font to be used on the prompt screen.

&minus;planfont fontname

option sets the font to be used
for the text that is displayed in the lower part of the
password screen.

&minus;fg color

The fg option sets the
color of the text on the password screen to color
.

&minus;bg color

The bg option sets the
color of the background on the password screen to color
.

&minus;foreground color

The foreground option
sets the color of the text on the password screen to
color .

&minus;background color

The background option
sets the color of the background on the password screen to
color .

&minus;username string

Text string is shown in
front of user name, defaults to "Name: ".

&minus;password string

Text string is the
password prompt string, defaults to "Password:
".

&minus;info string

Text string is an
informational message to tell the user what to do, defaults
to "Enter password to unlock; select icon to
lock.".

&minus;validate string

Text string is a message
shown while validating the password, defaults to
"Validating login..."

&minus;invalid string

Text string is a message
shown when password is invalid, defaults to "Invalid
login."

&minus;geometry geom

The geometry option sets
geom the size and offset of the lock window (normally
the entire screen). The entire screen format is still used
for entering the password. The purpose is to see the screen
even though it is locked. This should be used with caution
since many of the modes will fail if the windows are far
from square or are too small (size must be greater than
0x0). This should also be used with -enablesaver to protect

**WARNING**

xlock
can appear to hang if it is competing with a high-priority
process for the CPU. For example, if xlock is started
after a process with &rsquo;nice -20&rsquo; (high priority),
xlock will take considerable amount of time to
respond.

SHADOW PASSWORDS

If the machine
is using a shadow password system, then xlock may not
be set up to get the real password and so must be given one
of its own. This can be either on the command line, via the
-cpasswd option, or in the file
$HOME/.xlockrc, with the first taking precedence. In
both cases an encrypted password is expected (see
makekey(8)). If neither is given, then xlock will
prompt for a password and will use that, also storing an
encrypted version of it in $HOME/.xlockrc for future
use.

XLOCK AND SSH-AGENT

If you use
ssh-agent(1) to avoid entering a passphrase every time you
use one of your ssh(1) private keys, it&rsquo;s good
security practice to have ssh-agent forget the keys before
you leave your terminal unattended. That way, an attacker
who takes over your terminal won&rsquo;t be able to use your
private ssh keys to log in to other systems. Once you return
to your terminal, you can enter the passphrase and re-add
the keys to ssh-agent. There are a couple of ways in which
xlock can help to automate this process. Firstly, the
startCmd option allows xlock to be configured
to run &rsquo;ssh-add -D&rsquo; every time you lock the
screen, so that your keys are automatically deleted from
ssh-agent. If the passphrase on your ssh keys is the same as
your password, then xlock can also be made to re-add
the keys to ssh-agent when you unlock the screen, via the
pipepassCmd option. This requires a bit of scripting,
as the command must read your password from standard input
and then automate the interaction with ssh-add to re-add the
keys. There is an example of such a script in the
xlock distribution - see etc/xlockssh*

BUGS

"kill
-KILL xlock " causes the server that was locked
to be unusable, since all hosts (including localhost) were
removed from the access control list to lock out new X
clients, and since xlock could not catch SIGKILL, it
terminated before restoring the access control list. This
will leave the X server in a state where "you can no
longer connect to that server, and this operation cannot be
reversed unless you reset the server." -From the
X11R4 Xlib Documentation, Chapter 7. 
NCD terminals do not allow xlock to remove all the hosts
from the access control list. Therefore you will need to use
the "-remote" and "-allowaccess"
switches. If you happen to run without
"-allowaccess" on an NCD terminal, xlock
will not work and you will need to reboot the terminal, or
simply go into the SETUP menus, under &rsquo;Network
Parameters&rsquo;, and turn off TCP/IP access control.
