Search for Files... from a Main Menu or from

DESCRIPTION

MATE Search
Tool is a utility for finding files on your system. To
perform a basic search, you can type a filename or a partial
filename, with or without wildcards. To refine your search,
you can apply additional search options.

MATE Search
Tool uses the find, grep, and locate UNIX commands. The
case sensitivity of the search depends on your operating
system. For example, on Linux, the find, grep, and locate
commands support the -i option, so all searches are
case-insensitive.

For full
documentation see the MATE Search Tool online
help.
