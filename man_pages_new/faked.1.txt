NAME

faked &minus;
daemon that remembers fake ownership/permissions of files
manipulated by fakeroot processes.

SYNOPSIS

faked
[&minus;&minus;debug] [&minus;&minus;foreground]
[&minus;&minus;cleanup] [&minus;&minus;key
msg-key] [&minus;&minus;load]
[&minus;&minus;save-file save-file]
[&minus;&minus;port TCP-port]

DESCRIPTION

If a fakeroot
process wants to change the ownership of a file, then
faked is the process that remembers that new owner.
If later the same fakeroot process does a stat() for that
filename, then the libfakeroot wrapped stat() call will
first ask faked for the fake ownership etc of that file, and
then report it.

OPTIONS

&minus;&minus;debug

Print debugging information on
stderr.

&minus;&minus;foreground

Don&rsquo;t fork into the
background.

&minus;&minus;cleanup
 number

Cleanup the semaphores.

&minus;&minus;key
 key-number

Don&rsquo;t allocate a new
communication channel, but use channel specified by key. (If
the specified channel doesn&rsquo;t exist, it&rsquo;s
created).

&minus;&minus;save&minus;file
 save-file

Save the environment to
save-file on exit.

&minus;&minus;load

Load a previously saved environment from the standard
input. 

&minus;&minus;unknown&minus;is&minus;real

Use real ownership of
previously-unknown files instead of setting them to
root:root.

&minus;&minus;port
 tcp-port

Use TCP port tcp-port.

BUGS

None so far. Be
warned, though: although I&rsquo;ve written quite a few much
larger (and smaller) programs, I&rsquo;ve never written
anything that was as tiny as fakeroot, had as many
bugs as fakeroot, and still was as usable as, say,
fakeroot version 0.0_3, the first version that could
be used to build itself.
