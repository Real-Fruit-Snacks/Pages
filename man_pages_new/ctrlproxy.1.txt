SYNOPSIS

ctrlproxy
[&minus;d file] [&minus;l file] [&minus;D]

DESCRIPTION

ctrlproxy
is a modular IRC proxy. It connects to a number of IRC
servers and then passes data it receives on to the modules
that have been loaded into it. Current modules are
client_simple (for proxy support) and log (for
irssi&minus;style log file generation).

By default,
ctrlproxy listens for client connections on port 6668 and
any ports after that one, depending on the number of servers
it is connected to.
