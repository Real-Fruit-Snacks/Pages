NAME

tail - deliver
the last part of a file

SYNOPSIS

tail [
+-number[lbc][rf] ] [
file ]

tail [
-fr ] [ -n nlines ] [ -c
nbytes ] [ file ]

DESCRIPTION

Tail
copies the named file to the standard output beginning at a
designated place. If no file is named, the standard input is
copied.

Copying begins
at position +number measured from the
beginning, or -number from the end of the
input. Number is counted in lines, 1K blocks or
bytes, according to the appended flag or Default is
-10l (ten ell).

The further
flag causes tail to print lines from the end of the file in
reverse order; (follow) causes tail, after printing
to the end, to keep watch and print further data as it
appears.

The second
syntax is that promulgated by POSIX, where the
numbers rather than the options are signed.

EXAMPLES

tail
file

Print the last 10 lines of a
file.

tail +0f file

Print a file, and continue to
watch data accumulate as it grows.

sed 10q file

Print the first 10 lines of a
file.

BUGS

Tails relative
to the end of the file are treasured up in a buffer, and
thus are limited in length.

According to
custom, option +number counts lines from 1,
and counts blocks and bytes from 0.

Tail is
ignorant of UTF.
