NAME

ilbmtoppm -
convert an ILBM file into a PPM image

SYNOPSIS

ilbmtoppm
[-ignore] [ -isham |
-isnotham | -isehb | -isnotehb |
-isdeep | -isnotdeep ] [-cmaponly]
[-adjustcolors] [-transparent color]
[-maskfile filename [-verbose]
[ILBMfile]

DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

ilbmtoppm
reads an IFF ILBM file as input and produces a PPM image as
output. ilbmtoppm can handle the following ILBM
types:

&bull;

Normal ILBMs with 1-16 planes.

&bull;

Amiga Extra_Halfbrite (EHB)

&bull;

Amiga HAM with 3-16 planes.

&bull;

24 bit.

&bull;

Multiplatte (normal or HAM) pictures.

&bull;

Color map (BMHD + CMAP chunk only, nPlanes = 0).

&bull;

Unofficial direct color. 1-16 planes for each color
component. 

ilbmtoppm
uses these ILBM chunks: BMHD, CMAP, CAMG (only HAM & EHB
flags used), PCHG, BODY unofficial DCOL chunk to identify
direct color ILBM. It ignores these chunks: GRAB, DEST,
SPRT, CRNG, CCRT, CLUT, DPPV, DRNG, EPSF. It ignores, but
displays in verbose mode, these: NAME, AUTH, (c), ANNO, DPI.
It skips chunks whose type it doesn&rsquo;t recognize.

OPTIONS

In addition to
the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most
notably -quiet, see
 Common Options ),
ilbmtoppm recognizes the following command line
options: 
-transparent color

This is the color that should
"show through" in places where the image is
transparent.

color is
like the argument
of the pnm_parsecolor() library routine .

-verbose

Give some information about the
ILBM file.

-ignore
chunkID

Skip a chunk. chunkID is
the 4-letter IFF chunk identifier of the chunk to be
skipped.

-isham |
-isehb

Treat the input file as a HAM
or Extra_Halfbrite picture, even if these flags are not set
in the CAMG chunk (or if there is no CAMG chunk).

-maskfile
filename

This names a file for
ilbmtoppm to create with the image&rsquo;s
transparency mask. The mask file is a PBM image which maps
to the input image with white pixels representing
transparent pixels in the image and black pixels
representing opaque pixels.

If you
don&rsquo;t specify this, or the image does not contain
transparency information, ilbmtoppm does not create a
mask file.

-cmaponly

With this option,
ilbmtoppm generates a PPM of the ILBM&rsquo;s
color map, not the image itself.

ilbmtoppm
does the same thing even without -cmaponly if the
ILBM is a pure color map stream (it has a bitmap header with
an nplanes value of zero or has no BODY chunk.

-adjustcolors

If all colors in the CMAP have
a value of less then 16, ilbmtoppm assumes a 4-bit colormap
and gives a warning. With this option the colormap is scaled
to 8 bits.

LIMITATIONS

The
multipalette PCHG BigLineChanges and Huffman decompression
code is untested.
