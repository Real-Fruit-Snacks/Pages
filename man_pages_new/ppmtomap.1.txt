NAME

ppmtomap -
replaced by pnmcolormap

DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

This program
exists only for backward compatibility.

Use
pnmcolormap, which replaced it in January 2002.

One trivial
difference between ppmtomap and pnmcolormap
all is that if the input is PBM or PGM, ppmtomap
would produce PPM output, whereas pnmcolormap all
produces the same kind of output as the input. This should
not be very noticeable, though, as PBM and PGM images are
usually usable anywhere a PPM image is.

OPTIONS

There are no
command line options defined specifically for
ppmtomap, but it recognizes the options common to all
programs based on libnetpbm (See
 Common Options
.)
