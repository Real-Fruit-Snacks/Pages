NAME

gh-auth-login -
Log in to a GitHub account

SYNOPSIS

gh auth
login [flags]

DESCRIPTION

Authenticate
with a GitHub host.

The default
authentication mode is a web-based browser flow. After
completion, an authentication token will be stored securely
in the system credential store. If a credential store is not
found or there is an issue using it gh will fallback to
writing the token to a plain text file. See gh auth
status for its stored location.

Alternatively,
use --with-token to pass in a token on standard
input. The minimum required scopes for the token are:
repo, read:org, and gist.

Alternatively,
gh will use the authentication token found in environment
variables. This method is most suitable for
"headless" use of gh such as in automation. See
gh help environment for more info.

To use gh in
GitHub Actions, add GH_TOKEN: ${{ github.token }} to
env.

The git
protocol to use for git operations on this host can be set
with --git-protocol, or during the interactive
prompting. Although login is for a single account on a host,
setting the git protocol will take effect for all users on
the host.

OPTIONS

The protocol to use for git
operations on this host: {ssh|https}

-h, --hostname

instance to authenticate with
