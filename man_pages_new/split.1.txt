NAME

split - split a
file into pieces

SYNOPSIS

split [
option ... ] [ file ]

DESCRIPTION

Split
reads file (standard input by default) and writes it
in pieces of 1000 lines per output file. The names of the
output files are xaa, xab, and so on to
xzz. The options are

-n n

Split into n-line pieces.

-l n

Synonym for -n n, a nod to Unix&rsquo;s
syntax. 

-e expression

File divisions occur at each
line that matches a regular expression; see
regexp(7). Multiple -e options may appear. If
a subexpression of expression is contained in
parentheses (...), the output file name is the
portion of the line which matches the subexpression.

-f stem

Use stem instead of
x in output file names.

-s suffix

Append suffix to names
identified under -e.

-x

Exclude the matched input line from the output file.

-i

Ignore case in option -e; force output file names
(excluding the suffix) to lower case.
