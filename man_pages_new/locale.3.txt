NAME

locale - Perl
pragma to use or avoid POSIX locales for built-in
operations

WARNING

DO NOT
USE this pragma in scripts that have multiple
threads active. The locale is not local to a single thread.
Another thread may change the locale at any time, which
could cause at a minimum that a given thread is operating in
a locale it isn&rsquo;t expecting to be in. On some
platforms, segfaults can also occur. The locale change need
not be explicit; some operations cause perl to change the
locale itself. You are vulnerable simply by having done a
"use locale".

SYNOPSIS

    @x = sort @y;      # Native-platform/Unicode code point sort order
    {
        use locale;
        @x = sort @y;  # Locale-defined sort order
    }
    @x = sort @y;      # Native-platform/Unicode code point sort order
                       # again

DESCRIPTION

This pragma
tells the compiler to enable (or disable) the use of
POSIX locales for built-in operations (for
example, LC_CTYPE for regular expressions,
LC_COLLATE for string comparison, and
LC_NUMERIC for number formatting). Each
"use locale" or "no locale" affects
statements to the end of the enclosing
BLOCK.

See perllocale
for more detailed information on how Perl supports
locales.

On systems that
don&rsquo;t have locales, this pragma will cause your
operations to behave as if in the "C" locale;
attempts to change the locale will fail.
