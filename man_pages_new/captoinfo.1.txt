NAME

captoinfo
- convert a termcap description into a
terminfo description

SYNOPSIS

captoinfo
[tic-option] [file ...]

captoinfo
-V

DESCRIPTION

captoinfo
translates terminal descriptions. It looks in each given
text file for termcap entries and, for each
one found, writes an equivalent terminfo description
to the standard output stream. termcap tc
capabilities translate to terminfo
&ldquo;use&rdquo; capabilities.

If no
files are specified, captoinfo interprets the
content of the environment variable TERMCAP as a file
name, and extracts only the entry for the terminal named in
the environment variable TERM from it. If the
environment variable TERMCAP is not set,
captoinfo reads /etc/termcap.

This utility is
implemented as a link to tic(1), with the
latter&rsquo;s -I option implied. You can use other
tic options such as -1, -f, -v,
-w, and -x. The -V option reports the
version of ncurses associated with this program and
exits with a successful status.

Translations
from Nonstandard Capabilities 
captoinfo translates some obsolete, nonstandard
capabilities into standard (SVr4/XSI Curses) terminfo
capabilities. It issues a diagnostic to the standard error
stream for each, inviting the user to check that it has not
mistakenly translated an unknown or mistyped capability
name.

XENIX
termcap had a set of extension capabilities,
corresponding to box drawing characters of CCSID
(&ldquo;code page&rdquo;) 437, as follows.

captoinfo
composes single-line capabilities into an acsc
string, and discards GG and double-line capabilities
with a warning diagnostic.

IBM&rsquo;s AIX
has a terminfo facility descended from SVr1
terminfo, but which is incompatible with the SVr4
format. captoinfo translates the following AIX
extensions.

Additionally,
this program translates the AIX box1 capability to an
acsc string.

The HP-UX
terminfo library supports two nonstandard
terminfo capabilities, meml (memory lock) and
memu (memory unlock). captoinfo discards these
with a warning message.

FILES

/etc/termcap

default termcap terminal
capability database

PORTABILITY

X/Open Curses,
Issue 7 (2009) describes tic briefly, but omits this
program.

SVr4 systems
provide captoinfo as a separate application from
tic. Its -v option does not accept a trace
level argument n; repeat -v n times
instead.

NetBSD does not
provide this application.
