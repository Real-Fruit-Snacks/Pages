NAME

SET - defines
the mapping between fractional and user coordinates: sets
the values of the SPPS internal parameters &rsquo;LS&rsquo;
(axis linear/log scaling) and &rsquo;MI&rsquo; (axis mirror
imaging); defines GKS normalization transformation 1.

SYNOPSIS

CALL
SET(VL,VR,VB,VT,WL,WR,WB,WT,LF)

C-BINDING SYNOPSIS

#include

void
c_set(float vl, float vr, float vb, float vt, float wl,
float wr, float wb, float wt, int lf)

DESCRIPTION

VL

(an input expression of type
REAL) defines the left margin of the viewport in fractional
coordinates. 

VR

(an input expression of type REAL) defines the right
margin of the viewport in fractional coordinates.

VB

(an input expression of type REAL) defines the bottom
margin of the viewport in fractional coordinates.

VT

(an input expression of type REAL) defines the top
margin of the viewport in fractional coordinates.

WL

(an input expression of type REAL) defines the left
margin of the window in user coordinates.

WR

(an input expression of type REAL) defines the right
margin of the window in user coordinates.

WB

(an input expression of type REAL) defines the bottom
margin of the window in user coordinates.

WT

(an input expression of type REAL) defines the top
margin of the window in user coordinates.

LF

(an input expression of type INTEGER) defines the
linear/log nature of the mapping, as follows:

1

linear X, linear Y

2

linear X, log Y

3

log X, linear Y

4

log X, log Y

C-BINDING DESCRIPTION

The C-binding
argument descriptions are the same as the FORTRAN argument
descriptions.

USAGE

Note that in
setting the limits of the viewport and the window, the left
margin can have a user coordinate value that is larger than
the user coordinate value at the right margin. This means
the X axis scale will run from a maximum value at the left
to a minimum value at the right. Likewise the bottom value
can exceed the top value meaning that the Y axis can run
from a maximum at the bottom to a minimum at the top. This
reversal of the axes is referred to as "mirror
imaging". It represents a substantial functional
enhancement over what is provided in GKS. That is why NCAR
Graphics SET calls using fractional and user coordinates are
in general preferred over GKS calls to GSVP and GSWN using
normalized device coordinates and world coordinates.

EXAMPLES

Use the ncargex
command to see the following relevant examples: fcoord1,
fcoord2, splogy, sprevx.

sprevx shows
the use of routine SET for an X axis scaling reversal,
splogy shows the use of routine SET for logarithmic scaling
of the Y axis, fcoord1 shows the mapping from GKS world
coordinates to GKS normalized device coordinates, and
fcoord2 shows the mapping from NCAR Graphics user
coordinates to GKS normalized device coordinates.

ACCESS

To use SET or
c_set, load the NCAR Graphics libraries ncarg, ncarg_gks,
and ncarg_c, preferably in that order.
