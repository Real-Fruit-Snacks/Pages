NAME

spottopgm -
convert SPOT satellite images to a PGM image

SYNOPSIS

spottopgm
[-1|-2|-3] [Firstcol Firstline
Lastcol Lastline] inputfile

DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

spottopgm
converts the named inputfile to PGM format,
defaulting to the first color and the whole SPOT image
unless you specify otherwise with the options.

OPTIONS

In addition to
the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most
notably -quiet, see
 Common Options ),
spottopgm recognizes the following command line
options:

-1

-2

-3

Extract the given color from the SPOT image. The colors
are infrared, visible light, and ultraviolet, although I
don&rsquo;t know which corresponds to which number. If the
image is in color, spottopgm announces this on
Standard Error. The default color is 1.

PARAMETERS

Firstcol
Firstline Lastcol Lastline

Extract the specified rectangle
from the SPOT image. Most SPOT images are 3000 lines long
and 3000 or more columns wide. Unfortunately, the SPOT
format only gives the width and not the length. The width is
printed on standard error. The default rectangle is the
width of the input image by 3000 lines.

LIMITATIONS

spottopgm
doesn&rsquo;t determine the length of the input file; this
would involve two passes over the input file. It defaults to
3000 lines instead.

spottopgm
could extract a three-color image (as a PPM), but I
didn&rsquo;t feel like making the program more complicated
than it is now. Besides, there is no one-to-one
correspondence between red, green, blue and infrared,
visible and ultraviolet.

I&rsquo;ve had
only a limited number of SPOT images to play with, and
therefore wouldn&rsquo;t guarantee that this will work on
any other images.
