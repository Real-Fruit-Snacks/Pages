KLDLOAD(8)

NAME

kldload &mdash; load a
file into the kernel

SYNOPSIS

kldload
[&minus;v] file ...

DESCRIPTION

The kldload utility loads
file.ko into the kernel using the kernel linker. Note
that if multiple modules are specified then an attempt will
be made to load them all, even if some fail.

The following
option is available:

&minus;v

Be more
verbose.

FILES 
/boot/kernel

directory
containing loadable modules. Modules must have an extension
of .ko.

DIAGNOSTICS

The kldload utility
exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error
occurs.

AUTOMATICALLY LOADING
MODULES

Some modules (ipfw, ipf, etc.)
may be automatically loaded at boot time by having their
operation enabled in rc.conf(5). Modules may also be
auto-loaded through their addition to loader.conf(5).

HISTORY

The kldload utility first
appeared in FreeBSD 3.0, replacing the lkm(4)
interface.
