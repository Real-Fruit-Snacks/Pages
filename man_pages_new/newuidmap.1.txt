NAME

newuidmap - set
the uid mapping of a user namespace

SYNOPSIS

newuidmap pid uid
loweruid count
[uid loweruid count [ ... ]] 

DESCRIPTION

The
newuidmap sets /proc/[pid]/uid_map based on its
command line arguments and the uids allowed. Subuid
delegation can either be managed via /etc/subuid or through
the configured NSS subid module. These options are mutually
exclusive.

Note that the
root user is not exempted from the requirement for a valid
/etc/subuid entry.

After the pid
argument, newuidmap expects sets of 3 integers:

uid

Beginning of the range of UIDs
inside the user namespace.

loweruid

Beginning of the range of UIDs
outside the user namespace.

count

Length of the ranges (both
inside and outside the user namespace).

newuidmap
verifies that the caller is the owner of the process
indicated by pid and that for each of the above sets,
each of the UIDs in the range [loweruid, loweruid+count) is
allowed to the caller according to /etc/subuid before
setting /proc/[pid]/uid_map.

Note that
newuidmap may be used only once for a given process.

Instead of an
integer process id, the first argument may be specified as
fd:N, where the integer N is the file descriptor
number for the calling process's opened file descriptor for
the directory /proc/[pid]. In this case, newuidmap
will use openat(2) to open the uid_map file under that
directory, avoiding a TOCTTOU in case the process exits and
the pid is immediately reused.

OPTIONS

There currently
are no options to the newuidmap command.

FILES

/etc/subuid

List of user's subordinate user
IDs.

/proc/[pid]/uid_map

Mapping of uids from one
between user namespaces.
