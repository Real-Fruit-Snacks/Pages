SYNOPSIS

#include

pcre2_convert_context
*pcre2_convert_context_copy( 
pcre2_convert_context *cvcontext);

DESCRIPTION

This function
is part of an experimental set of pattern conversion
functions. It makes a new copy of a convert context, using
the memory allocation function that was used for the
original context. The result is NULL if the memory cannot be
obtained.

The pattern
conversion functions are described in the
pcre2convert documentation.
