DESCRIPTION

nload is
a console application which monitors network traffic and
bandwidth usage in real time. It visualizes the in- and
outgoing traffic using two graphs and provides additional
info like the total amount of transferred data and min/max
network usage.

USAGE

When running
nload, you can switch between the devices (which you
gave nload either on the command line or which were
auto-detected) by pressing the left and right arrow keys. If
the &minus;m command line parameter is given, the
arrow keys switch as many devices back and forth as there
are shown on the screen. If you want to quit, do so by
pressing &rsquo;q&rsquo; or &rsquo;Ctrl+C&rsquo;.

For further key
shortcuts, have a look at the sections MAIN WINDOW
and OPTION WINDOW below.

OPTIONS

A summary of
the options supported by nload is included below.

&minus;a period

Sets the length in seconds of
the time window for average calculation. The default is
300.

&minus;i max_scaling

Specifies the 100% mark in
kBit/s of the graph indicating the incoming bandwidth usage.
Ignored if max_scaling is 0 or the switch &minus;m is given.
The default value for max_scaling is 10240.

&minus;m

Show multiple devices at a time; do not show the traffic
graphs. 

&minus;o max_scaling

Same as &minus;i but for the
graph indicating the outgoing bandwidth usage.

&minus;t interval

Determines the refresh interval
of the display in milliseconds. The default value of
interval is 500.

PLEASE NOTE:
Specifying refresh intervals shorter than about 100
milliseconds makes traffic calculation very unprecise. Also
the display may flicker using such short refresh intervals.
nload tries to balance this out by doing extra time
measurements, but this may not always succeed.

&minus;u
h|H|b|B|k|K|m|M|g|G

Sets the type of unit used for
the display of traffic numbers. h means human readable
(auto), b Bit/s, k kBit/s, m MBit/s and g GBit/s. The upper
case letters mean the corresponding units in Bytes (instead
of Bits). The default is k.

&minus;U
h|H|b|B|k|K|m|M|g|G

Same as &minus;u, but for an
amount of data, e.g. Bit, kByte, GBit etc. (without
"/s"). The default is M.

devices

Network devices to use. The
default is "all", which means to display all
auto-detected devices.

&minus;h,
&minus;&minus;help

Show a short summary of these
command line options.

MAIN WINDOW

After starting,
nload begins to monitor the network devices given on
the command line, or, if none where specified, the default
device. In this mode, the following key shortcuts are
available. 
&rsquo;ArrowRight&rsquo;, &rsquo;ArrowDown&rsquo;,
&rsquo;PageDown&rsquo;, &rsquo;Enter&rsquo;,
&rsquo;Tab&rsquo;

Switch the display to the next
network device, or, when started with the &minus;m
flag, to the next page of devices.

&rsquo;ArrowLeft&rsquo;,
&rsquo;ArrowUp&rsquo;, &rsquo;PageUp&rsquo;

Switch the display to the
previous network device, or, when started with the
&minus;m flag, to the previous page of devices.

&rsquo;F2&rsquo;

Show the option window (see section OPTION WINDOW
below). 

&rsquo;F5&rsquo;

Save current settings to the user&rsquo;s config
file. 

&rsquo;F6&rsquo;

Reload settings from the config files.

&rsquo;q&rsquo;,
&rsquo;Ctrl+C&rsquo;

Quit nload.

OPTION WINDOW

The parameters
given to nload on the command line can be adjusted
during run time by pressing the &rsquo;F2&rsquo; key. A
small window appears on the top of the screen, listing the
available settings.

&rsquo;F2&rsquo;

Show/hide the option window.

&rsquo;ArrowLeft&rsquo;,
&rsquo;ArrowRight&rsquo;, &rsquo;Home&rsquo;,
&rsquo;End&rsquo;

Navigate within the edit
fields.

&rsquo;ArrowUp&rsquo;,
&rsquo;ArrowDown&rsquo;, &rsquo;Enter&rsquo;

Navigate between the
settings.

&rsquo;PageUp&rsquo;,
&rsquo;PageDown&rsquo;, &rsquo;Tab&rsquo;

Toggle between the different
values possible for the current field.

&rsquo;+&rsquo; /
&rsquo;-&rsquo;

Switch to the next / previous
page of settings.

FILES

/etc/nload.conf

System-wide configuration
file.

$(HOME)/.nload

User-specific configuration
file (overrides system-wide settings).

/sys/class/net/*/*
/proc/net/dev

are read by nload when
running on Linux to get the network traffic data.

This manual
page describes version 0.7.4 of nload.
