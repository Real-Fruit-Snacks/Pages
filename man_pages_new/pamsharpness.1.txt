NAME

pamsharpness -
measure the sharpness of a PNM/PAM image

SYNOPSIS

pamsharpness
[imagefile]

DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

pamsharpness
reads a Netpbm image (PNM or PAM) and prints a message to
Standard Output giving a number that tells how sharp it
is.

Sharpness is a
measure of how suddenly (in space) colors change in the
image. pamsharpness computes the sharpness of the
image as the average difference in intensity between each
pixel and its 8 surrounding pixels, in each of the color
components (R, G, B).

pamsharpness
does not include the edges of the image, where there are not
8 pixels surrounding a pixel, in its computation.

pamsharpness
assumes that the image is a PNM or PNM equivalent PAM. If it
isn&rsquo;t, the results are not necessarily meaningful.

OPTIONS

There are no
command line options defined specifically for
pamsharpness, but it recognizes the options common to
all programs based on libnetpbm (See
 Common Options
.)

SEE ALSO

pamsharpmap(1),
pammasksharpen(1), pam(1), pnm(1)

HISTORY

pamsharpness
was added to Netpbm in Release 10.21 (March 2004). Bryan
Henderson derived it from the program pnmsharp by
B.W. van Schooten and distributed as part of the
Photopnmtools package.
