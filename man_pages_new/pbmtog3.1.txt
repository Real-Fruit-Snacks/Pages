NAME

pbmtog3 -
convert a PBM image into a Group 3 MH fax file

SYNOPSIS

pbmtog3
[-reversebits] [-nofixedwidth]
[-align8|-align16] [pbmfile]

DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

pbmtog3
reads a PBM image as input and produces a Group 3 MH fax
file as output.

You can also
generate a TIFF file that uses the same encoding inside,
with pamtotiff.

There is no
program in Netpbm that generates other fax formats, such as
MR and MMR, but pamtotiff can generate TIFF files
that use those encodings.

OPTIONS

In addition to
the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most
notably -quiet, see
 Common Options ),
pbmtog3 recognizes the following command line
options: 
-reversebits

This option causes the output
to have the bits in every byte reversed so the least
significant bit becomes the most significant bit. Some fax
modems expect bits in reverse order, and this compensates
for that. If you get a whole bunch of "bad code
word" messages when you try to read the G3 file (e.g.
with g3topbm), try using this option. Note that the
output is not G3 when you use this option.

-nofixedwidth

Most fax machines expect the
image to be 1728 columns wide, so pbmtog3 cuts the
output to this width by default. If you want to keep the
width of the original image, use this option.

This option was
new in Netpbm 10.6 (July 2002). Before that, pbmtog3
always kept the width of the original image.

-align8 
-align16

These options say to align
output rows to 8-bit or 16-bit boundaries, respectively, by
adding padding bits in front of EOL codes

Without these
options, pbmtog3 adds no padding and rows may begin
and ends anywhere within a byte.

You cannot
specify both.

These options
were new in Netpbm 10.79 (June 2017).

HISTORY

Before Netpbm
10.79 (June 2017), there was a different program by the same
name in Netpbm, which was written by by Paul Haeberli
paul [AT] manray.com> in 1989 and then modified
extensively by others.

Akira
Urushibata afu [AT] wta.jp> wrote the current
version, with an entirely different algorithm, in April 2017
and contributed his work to the public domain.

The current
program is backward compatible with the pre-10.79
version.
