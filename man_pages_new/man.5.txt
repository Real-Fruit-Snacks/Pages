NAME

man &minus;
macros to format Reference Manual pages

SYNOPSIS

nroff
-man filename...

troff
-man filename...

DESCRIPTION

These macros
are used to lay out the reference pages in this manual.
Note: if filename contains format input for a
preprocessor, the commands shown above must be piped through
the appropriate preprocessor. This is handled automatically
by the man(1) command. See the
&rsquo;&rsquo;Conventions&rsquo;&rsquo; section.

Any text
argument t may be zero to six words. Quotes may be
used to include  characters in a
"word". If text is empty, the special
treatment is applied to the next input line with text to be
printed. In this way .I may be used to italicize a
whole line, or .SB may be used to make small bold
letters.

A prevailing
indent distance is remembered between successive indented
paragraphs, and is reset to default value upon reaching a
non-indented paragraph. Default units for indents i
are ens.

Type font and
size are reset to default values before each paragraph, and
after processing font and size setting macros.

These strings
are predefined by -man:

\*R

&rsquo;&reg;&rsquo;, &rsquo;(Reg)&rsquo; in
nroff. 

\*S

Change to default type size.

Requests

* n.t.l. = next text line; p.i. = prevailing indent

Conventions

When formatting a manual page, man examines the first
line to determine whether it requires special processing.
For example a first line consisting of:

&rsquo;\"
t

indicates that
the manual page must be run through the tbl(1)
preprocessor.

A typical
manual page for a command or function is laid out as
follows: 
.TH title [1-9]

The name of the command or
function, which serves as the title of the manual page. This
is followed by the number of the section in which it
appears.

.SH NAME

The name, or list of names, by
which the command is called, followed by a dash and then a
one-line summary of the action performed. All in roman font,
this section contains no troff(1) commands or
escapes, and no macro requests. It is used to generate the
windex database, which is used by the
whatis(1) command.

.SH SYNOPSIS

Commands:

The syntax of the command and
its arguments, as typed on the command line. When in
boldface, a word must be typed exactly as printed. When in
italics, a word can be replaced with an argument that you
supply. References to bold or italicized items are not
capitalized in other sections, even when they begin a
sentence.

Syntactic
symbols appear in roman face:

[ ]

An argument, when surrounded by brackets is
optional. 

|

Arguments separated by a vertical bar are exclusive. You
can supply only one item from such a list.

...

Arguments followed by an ellipsis can be repeated. When
an ellipsis follows a bracketed set, the expression within
the brackets can be repeated.

Functions:

If required, the data
declaration, or #include directive, is shown first,
followed by the function declaration. Otherwise, the
function declaration is shown.

.SH DESCRIPTION

A narrative overview of the
command or function&rsquo;s external behavior. This includes
how it interacts with files or data, and how it handles the
standard input, standard output and standard error.
Internals and implementation details are normally omitted.
This section attempts to provide a succinct overview in
answer to the question, "what does it do?"

Literal text
from the synopsis appears in constant width, as do literal
filenames and references to items that appear elsewhere in
the reference manuals. Arguments are italicized.

If a command
interprets either subcommands or an input grammar, its
command interface or input grammar is normally described in
a USAGE section, which follows the OPTIONS
section. The DESCRIPTION section only describes the
behavior of the command itself, not that of subcommands.

.SH OPTIONS

The list of options along with
a description of how each affects the command&rsquo;s
operation.

.SH RETURN VALUES

A list of the values the
library routine will return to the calling program and the
conditions that cause these values to be returned.

.SH EXIT STATUS

A list of the values the
utility will return to the calling program or shell, and the
conditions that cause these values to be returned.

.SH FILES

A list of files associated with
the command or function.

.SH SEE ALSO

A comma-separated list of
related manual pages, followed by references to other
published materials.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS

A list of diagnostic messages
and an explanation of each.

.SH BUGS

A description of limitations,
known defects, and possible problems associated with the
command or function.
