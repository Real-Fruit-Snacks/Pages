NAME

go-run -
compile and run Go program

SYNOPSIS

go run
[build flags] [-exec xprog]
package [arguments...]

DESCRIPTION

Run compiles
and runs the named main Go package. 
Typically the package is specified as a list of .go source
files from a single directory, but it may also be an import
path, file system path, or pattern matching a single known
package, as in &rsquo;go run .&rsquo; or &rsquo;go run
my/cmd&rsquo;.

If the package
argument has a version suffix (like @latest or @v1.0.0),
"go run" builds the program in module-aware mode,
ignoring the go.mod file in the current directory or any
parent directory, if there is one. This is useful for
running programs without affecting the dependencies of the
main module.

By default,
&rsquo;go run&rsquo; runs the compiled binary directly:
&rsquo;a.out arguments...&rsquo;. 
If the -exec flag is given, &rsquo;go run&rsquo; invokes the
binary using xprog:

&rsquo;xprog
a.out arguments...&rsquo;.

If the -exec
flag is not given, GOOS or GOARCH is different from the
system default, and a program named go_$GOOS_$GOARCH_exec
can be found on the current search path, &rsquo;go
run&rsquo; invokes the binary using that program, for
example &rsquo;go_js_wasm_exec a.out arguments...&rsquo;.
This allows execution of cross-compiled programs when a
simulator or other execution method is available.

By default,
&rsquo;go run&rsquo; compiles the binary without generating
the information used by debuggers, to reduce build time. To
include debugger information in the binary, use &rsquo;go
build&rsquo;.

The exit status
of Run is not the exit status of the compiled binary.

packages&rsquo;.
