NAME

pamrgbatopng -
replaced by pamtopng

SYNOPSIS

pamrgbatopng
[pamfile]

DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

pamrgbatopng
was obsoleted by pamtopng(1), introduced with Netpbm
10.70 (June 2015). pamtopng is backward compatible
with pamrgbatopng, plus adds a plethora additional
functions.

Starting in
Release 10.70, pamrgbatopng is just an alias for
pamtopng.

pamrgbatopng
was added to Netpbm in 2005, and was always expected to be
retired eventually because it had almost no features,
compared to the more popular and much older pnmtopng.
It had, in fact, no command line options. But the one
feature it had that pnmtopng lacked was the ability
to recognize transparency in a PAM image. pamtopng
has that, as well as most of the features of
pnmtopng.
