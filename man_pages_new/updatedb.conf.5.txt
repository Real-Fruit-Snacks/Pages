NAME

/etc/updatedb.conf
- a configuration file for updatedb(8)

DESCRIPTION

/etc/updatedb.conf
is a text file. Blank lines are ignored. A #
character outside of a quoted string starts a comment
extending until end of line.

Other lines
must be of the following form:

VARIABLE =
"VALUE"

White space
between tokens is ignored. VARIABLE is an
alphanumeric string which does not start with a digit.
VALUE can contain any character except for
". No escape mechanism is supported within
VALUE and there is no way to write VALUE
spanning more than one line.

Unknown
VARIABLE values are considered an error. The defined
variables are: 
PRUNEFS

A whitespace-separated list of
file system types (as used in /etc/mtab) which should
not be scanned by updatedb(8). The file system type
matching is case-insensitive. By default, no file system
types are skipped.

When scanning a
file system is skipped, all file systems mounted in the
subtree are skipped too, even if their type does not match
any entry in PRUNEFS.

PRUNENAMES

A whitespace-separated list of
directory names (without paths) which should not be scanned
by updatedb(8). By default, no directory names are
skipped.

Note that only
directories can be specified, and no pattern mechanism (e.g.
globbing) is used.

PRUNEPATHS

A whitespace-separated list of
path names of directories which should not be scanned by
updatedb(8). Each path name must be exactly in the
form in which the directory would be reported by
locate(1).

By default, no
paths are skipped.

PRUNE_BIND_MOUNTS

One of the strings 0,
no, 1 or yes. If
PRUNE_BIND_MOUNTS is 1 or yes, bind
mounts are not scanned by updatedb(8). All file
systems mounted in the subtree of a bind mount are skipped
as well, even if they are not bind mounts. As an exception,
bind mounts of a directory on itself are not skipped. Note
that Btrfs subvolume mounts are handled internally in the
kernel as bind mounts (see btrfs-subvolume(8)), and
thus, may get skipped if you have also mounted the
filesystem root itself. To counteract this, make your root
directory a Btrfs subvolume, too.

By default,
bind mounts are not skipped.

NOTES

When a
directory is matched by PRUNEFS, PRUNENAMES or
PRUNEPATHS, updatedb(8) does not scan the
contents of the directory. The path of the directory itself
is, however, entered in the created database. For example,
if /tmp is in PRUNEPATHS, locate(1)
will not show any files stored in /tmp, but it can
show the /tmp directory. This behavior differs from
traditional locate implementations.

In some
updatedb(8) implementations PRUNEPATHS can be
used to exclude non-directory files. This is not the case in
this implementation.

/etc/updatedb.conf
is a shell script in some implementations, which allows much
more flexibility in defining the variables. Equivalent
functionality can be achieved by using the command-line
options to updatedb(8).
