NAME

systemd-gpt-auto-generator
- Generator for automatically discovering and mounting root,
/home/, /srv/, /var/ and /var/tmp/ partitions, as well as
discovering and enabling swap partitions, based on GPT
partition type GUIDs

SYNOPSIS

/usr/lib/systemd/system-generators/systemd-gpt-auto-generator

DESCRIPTION

systemd-gpt-auto-generator
is a unit generator that automatically discovers the root
partition, /home/, /srv/, /var/, /var/tmp/, the EFI System
Partition (ESP), the Extended Boot Loader Partition
(XBOOTLDR), and swap partitions and creates mount and swap
units for them, based on the partition type GUIDs of GUID
partition tables (GPT). See UEFI
Specification
[1]
, chapter 5 for more details. It
implements the Discoverable
Partitions Specification
[2]
.

Note
that this generator has no effect on non-GPT systems. It
will also not create mount point configuration for
directories which already contain files or if the mount
point is explicitly configured in fstab(5).
Additionally no unit will be created for the ESP or the
XBOOTLDR partition if mount entries are found in the /boot/
or /efi/ hierarchies in fstab(5).

If
the units this generator creates are overridden, for example
by units in directories with higher precedence, drop-ins and
additional dependencies created by this generator might
still be used.

This
generator will only look for the root partition on the same
physical disk where the EFI System Partition (ESP) is
located. Note that support from the boot loader is required:
the EFI variable LoaderDevicePartUUID of the
4a67b082-0a4c-41cf-b6c7-440b29bb8c4f vendor UUID is
used to determine from which partition, and hence the disk,
from which the system was booted. If the boot loader does
not set this variable, this generator will not be able to
detect the root partition. See the
Boot Loader Interface
[3]
for details.

Similarly,
this generator will only look for the other partitions on
the same physical disk as the root partition. In this case,
boot loader support is not required. These partitions will
not be searched for on systems where the root file system is
distributed on multiple disks, for example via btrfs
RAID.

systemd-gpt-auto-generator
is useful for centralizing file system configuration in the
partition table and making configuration in /etc/fstab or on
the kernel command line unnecessary.

This
generator looks for the partitions based on their partition
type GUID. The following partition type GUIDs are
identified:

Table 1. Partition
Type GUIDs 
This generator understands the following attribute flags for
partitions:

Table 2. Partition
Attribute Flags 
The /home/, /srv/, /var/, /var/tmp/ and swap partitions may
be encrypted in LUKS format. In this case, a device mapper
device is set up under the names /dev/mapper/home,
/dev/mapper/srv, /dev/mapper/var, /dev/mapper/tmp or
/dev/mapper/swap. Note that this might create conflicts if
the same partition is listed in /etc/crypttab with a
different device mapper device name.

When
systemd is running in the initrd the / partition may be
encrypted with LUKS as well. In this case, a device mapper
device is set up under the name /dev/mapper/root, and a
sysroot.mount is set up that mounts the device under
/sysroot. For more information, see
bootup(7).

The
root partition can be specified by symlinking
/run/systemd/volatile-root to /dev/block/$major:$minor. This
is especially useful if the root mount has been replaced by
some form of volatile file system (overlayfs).

Mount
and automount units for the EFI System Partition (ESP) and
Extended Boot Loader Partition (XBOOTLDR) are generated on
EFI systems. If the disk contains an XBOOTLDR partition, as
defined in the Boot Loader
Specification
[4]
, it is made available at /boot/. This
generator creates an automount unit; the mount will only be
activated on-demand when accessed. The mount point will be
created if necessary.

The
ESP is mounted to /boot/ if that directory exists and is not
used for XBOOTLDR, and otherwise to /efi/. Same as for
/boot/, an automount unit is used. The mount point will be
created if necessary.

No
configuration is created for mount points that are
configured in fstab(5) or when the target directory
contains files.

When
using this generator in conjunction with btrfs file systems,
make sure to set the correct default subvolumes on them,
using btrfs subvolume set-default.

If
the system was booted via systemd-stub(7) and the
stub reported to userspace that the kernel image was
measured to a TPM2 PCR, then any discovered root and /var/
volume identifiers (and volume encryption key in case it is
encrypted) will be automatically measured into PCR 15 on
activation, via systemd-pcrfs@.service(8).

systemd-gpt-auto-generator
implements systemd.generator(7).

KERNEL COMMAND LINE

systemd-gpt-auto-generator
understands the following kernel command line
parameters:

systemd.gpt_auto,
rd.systemd.gpt_auto

Those
options take an optional boolean argument, and default to
yes. The generator is enabled by default, and a false value
may be used to disable it (e.g.
"systemd.gpt_auto=0").

Added
in version 242.

systemd.image_policy=,
rd.systemd.image_policy=

Takes an
image dissection policy string as argument (as per
systemd.image-policy(7)), and allows enforcing a
policy on dissection and use of the automatically discovered
GPT partition table entries.

Added
in version 254.

root=,
rootfstype=, rootflags=

When
root= is used with the special value
"gpt-auto" (or if the parameter is not used at
all), automatic discovery of the root partition based on the
GPT partition type is enabled. Any other value disables this
logic.

The
rootfstype= and rootflags= are used to select
the file system type and options when the root file system
is automatically discovered.

Added
in version 242.

rw,
ro

Mount the
root partition read-write or read-only
initially.

Note
that unlike most kernel command line options these settings
do not override configuration in the file system, and the
file system may be remounted later. See
systemd-remount-fs.service(8).

Added
in version 242.

systemd.swap=

Takes a
boolean argument or enables the option if specified without
an argument. If disabled, automatic discovery of swap
partition(s) based on GPT partition type is disabled.
Defaults to enabled.

Added
in version 254.
