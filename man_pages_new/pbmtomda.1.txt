NAME

pbmtomda -
convert a PBM image to a Microdesign .mda

SYNOPSIS

pbmtomda

[-dscale]
[-invert] [--]

[pbmfile]

Minimum unique
abbreviation of option is acceptable. You may use double
hyphens instead of single hyphen to denote options. You may
use white space in place of the equals sign to separate an
option name from its value.

DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

pbmtomda
reads a PBM image as input and produces a MicroDesign 2 area
file (.MDA) as output.

If you do not
specify pbmfile, pbmtomda uses Standard
Input.

OPTIONS

In addition to
the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most
notably -quiet, see
 Common Options ),
pbmtomda recognizes the following command line
options:

-d

Halve the height of the output file, to compensate for
the aspect ratio used in MicroDesign files.

-i

Invert the colors used.

--

End of options (use this if the filename starts with
"-") 

LIMITATIONS

There&rsquo;s
no way to produce files in MicroDesign 3 format. MD3 itself
and mdatopbm(1) can read files in either format.
