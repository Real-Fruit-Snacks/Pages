Description

This GNU
roff output driver translates the output of
troff(1) into a CaPSL and VDM format suitable for
Canon LBP-4 and LBP-8 printers. Normally, grolbp is
invoked by groff(1) when the latter is given the
&ldquo;-T lbp&rdquo; option. (In this
installation, ps is the default output device.) Use
groff&rsquo;s -P option to pass any options
shown above to grolbp. If no file arguments
are given, or if file is &ldquo;-&rdquo;,
grolbp reads the standard input stream. Output is
written to the standard output stream.

Typefaces

The driver supports the Dutch, Swiss, and Swiss-Narrow
scalable typefaces, each in the regular, bold, italic, and
bold-italic styles. Additionally, the bitmapped, monospaced
Courier and Elite typefaces are available in regular, bold,
and italic styles; Courier at 8 and 12 points, Elite at 8
and 10 points. The following chart summarizes the
groff font names used to access them.

Paper format, orientation,
and device description file 
grolbp supports paper formats &ldquo;A4&rdquo;,
&ldquo;letter&rdquo;, &ldquo;legal&rdquo;, and
&ldquo;executive&rdquo;. These are matched
case-insensitively. The -p, --papersize option
overrides any setting in the device description file
DESC. If neither specifies a paper format, A4 is
assumed.

In its
DESC file, grolbp (case-insensitively)
recognizes an orientation directive accepting one
mandatory argument, portrait or landscape. The
first valid orientation directive encountered controls. The
-l, -o, and --orientation command-line
options override any setting in DESC. If none of the
foregoing specify the orientation, portrait is assumed.

Font
description files 
In addition to the font description file directives
documented in groff_font(5), grolbp recognizes
lbpname, which maps the groff font name to the
font name used internally by the printer. Its syntax is as
follows.

lbpname printer-font-name

lbpname&rsquo;s argument
is case-sensitive. The printer&rsquo;s font names are
encoded as follows.

For bitmapped
fonts, printer-font_name has the form

N&lang;
base-font-name&rang; &lang;
font-style&rang;

base-font-name is the
font name as it appears in the printer&rsquo;s font listings
without the first letter, up to (but not including) the font
size. font-style can be one of the letters R,
I, or B, indicating the roman, italic, and
bold styles, respectively. For instance, if the
printer&rsquo;s &ldquo;font listing A&rdquo; shows
&ldquo;Nelite12I.ISO_USA&rdquo;, the corresponding entry in
the groff font description file is

lbpname NeliteI

You may need to modify
grolbp to add support for new bitmapped fonts, since
the available font names and font sizes of bitmapped fonts
(as documented above) are hard-coded into the program.

For scalable
fonts, printer-font-name is identical to the font
name as it appears in the printer&rsquo;s &ldquo;font
listing A&rdquo;. For instance, to select the
&ldquo;Swiss&rdquo; font in bold-italic style, which appears
in the font listing as &ldquo;Swiss-BoldOblique&rdquo;,

lbpname Swiss-BoldOblique

is the required directive, and
this is what we find in the groff font description
file HBI for the lbp device.

Drawing
commands 
For compatibility with grolj4(1), an additional
drawing command is available. 
\D'R dh dv'

Draw a rule (solid black
rectangle) with one corner at the drawing position, and the
diagonally opposite corner at the drawing position
+(dh,dv).

Options

-h and
--help display a usage message, while -v and
--version show version information; all exit
afterward. 
-c num-copies 
--copies=num-copies

Produce num-copies
copies of each page.

-F font-directory

--fontdir=font-directory

Prepend directory
font-directory/devname to the search path for font
and device description files; name is the name of the
device, usually lbp.

-l

--landscape

Format the document in
landscape orientation.

-o orientation

--orientation=orientation

Format the document in the
given orientation, which must be
&ldquo;portrait&rdquo; or
&ldquo;landscape&rdquo;.

-p paper-format

--papersize=paper-format

Set the paper format to
paper-format, which must be a valid paper format as
described above.

-w width 
--linewidth=width

Set the default line thickness
to width thousandths of an em; the default is
40 (0.04 em).

Environment

GROFF_FONT_PATH

lists directories in which to
seek the selected output device&rsquo;s directory of device
and font description files. See troff(1) and
groff_font(5).

Files

/usr/share/groff/1.23.0/font/devlbp/DESC

describes the lbp output
device.

/usr/share/groff/1.23.0/font/devlbp/F

describes the font known
as F on device lbp.

/usr/share/groff/1.23.0/tmac/lbp.tmac

defines macros for use with the
lbp output device. It is automatically loaded by
troffrc when the lbp output device is
selected.
