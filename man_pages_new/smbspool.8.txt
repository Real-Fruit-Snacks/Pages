NAME

smbspool - send
a print file to an SMB printer

SYNOPSIS

smbspool {job} {user} {title}
{copies} {options} [filename]

DESCRIPTION

This tool is
part of the samba(7) suite.

smbspool is a
very small print spooling program that sends a print file to
an SMB printer. The command-line arguments are
position-dependent for compatibility with the Common UNIX
Printing System, but you can use smbspool with any printing
system or from a program or script.

DEVICE
URI

smbspool
specifies the destination using a Uniform Resource
Identifier ("URI") with a method of
"smb". This string can take a number of forms:

&bull;
smb://server[:port]/printer

&bull;
smb://workgroup/server[:port]/printer

&bull;
smb://username:password@server[:port]/printer

&bull;
smb://username:password@workgroup/server[:port]/printer

smbspool tries
to get the URI from the environment variable
DEVICE_URI. If DEVICE_URI is not present,
smbspool will use argv[0] if that starts with
&ldquo;smb://&rdquo; or argv[1] if that is not the case.

Programs using
the exec(2) functions can pass the URI in argv[0], while
shell scripts must set the DEVICE_URI environment
variable prior to running smbspool.

OPTIONS

&bull; The job
argument (argv[1]) contains the job ID number and is
presently not used by smbspool.

&bull; The user
argument (argv[2]) contains the print user's name and is
presently not used by smbspool.

&bull; The
title argument (argv[3]) contains the job title string and
is passed as the remote file name when sending the print
job.

&bull; The
copies argument (argv[4]) contains the number of copies to
be printed of the named file. If no filename is provided
then this argument is not used by smbspool.

&bull; The
options argument (argv[5]) contains the print options in a
single string and is currently not used by smbspool.

&bull; The
filename argument (argv[6]) contains the name of the file to
print. If this argument is not specified then the print file
is read from the standard input.
