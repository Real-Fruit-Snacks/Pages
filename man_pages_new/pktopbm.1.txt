NAME

pktopbm -
convert packed (PK) format font into PBM

SYNOPSIS

pktopbm pkfile
[ -x width ] [ -y height ] [-c num] pbmfile ...

DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

pktopbm
reads a packed (PK) font file as input, and produces PBM
images as output. If the filename "-" is used for
any of the filenames, the standard input stream (or standard
output where appropriate) will be used. If either the width
or height is specified, this value will be used for all
bitmaps produced. Also if one or both values are specified,
the bitmap will be relocated with the hoffset and voffset
given in the pkfile. The basepoint will be placed in the
lower left corner of the bitmap if the bitmap is bigger than
the specified size it will be truncated at the top or
right.

OPTIONS

In addition to
the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most
notably -quiet, see
 Common Options ),
pktopbm recognizes the following command line
options: 
-character num

This is the
code point (character number) to which the first 
specified output file pertains. Ergo, there is no output for
any 
code point lower than this.

-x width

The width of the image in
columns.

The default is
what is specified in the font file.

-y width

The height of the image in
rows.

The default is
what is specified in the font file.

HISTORY

Before Netpbm
11.04 (September 2023), the program would sometimes add 
the suffix &rsquo;.pk&rsquo; to the specified input file
name. It also 
let you specify multiple -c options, with each
applying to the 
output file names that came after it.
