NAME

pamtooctaveimg
- convert a Netpbm image to a GNU Octave image

SYNOPSIS

pamtooctaveimg
[netpbmfile]

DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

pamtooctaveimg
reads a Netpbm image as input and produces a
http://www.octave.org/">GNU Octave image file
as output.

An Octave image
file (called "Octave&rsquo;s image format" in
Octave documentation) is a particular kind of Octave data
file. It describes two matrices:

&bull;

the image itself as a list of indexes into a colormap,
and 

&bull;

the corresponding colormap as a list of {red, green,
blue} triplets.

An Octave data
file is an ASCII text file that you use to import data to
Octave.

See the
http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/doc/interpreter/Image-Processing.html#Image-Processing">
Image Processing chapter of the GNU Octave manual for
details.

pamtooctaveimg
writes the output Octave image to Standard Output.

OPTIONS

There are no
command line options defined specifically for
pamtooctaveimg, but it recognizes the options common
to all programs based on libnetpbm (See
 Common Options
.)

ARGUMENTS

netpbmfile
is the name of the file containing the input PNM or PAM
image, or - to indicate Standard Input. If you
don&rsquo;t specify netpbmfile, the input is from
Standard Input. pamtooctaveimg converts only the
first image in the input stream.

EXAMPLES

%
pamtooctaveimg myimage.ppm > myimage.img 
% octave 
> [img,map] = loadimage("myimage.img");

# (At this
point, img is an X by Y matrix and map is a 3 by M
matrix.)

>
imshow(img,map); # Displays img with colormap map 
> [r,g,b] = ind2rgb(img,map);

# (r, g, and b
are now each X by Y matrices of color levels [0 to 1].)

>
[newimg,newmap] = rgb2ind(r,b,g); # Swap the blue and green
channels. 
> saveimage("newimage.ppm", newimg,
"ppm", newmap); # Save as a PPM file.

NOTES

There is no
octavetopam program. However, GNU Octave&rsquo;s
saveimage command can save images in PPM format.

pamtooctaveimg
was new in Netpbm 10.39 (June 2007).
