NAME

exim_checkaccess
- Check address acceptance from given IP

SYNOPSIS

exim_checkaccess
IP-address email@address [more Exim options]

DESCRIPTION

Exim&rsquo;s
-bh command line argument allows you to run a fake SMTP
session with debugging output, in order to check what Exim
is doing when it is applying policy controls to incoming
SMTP mail. However, not everybody is sufficiently familiar
with the SMTP protocol to be able to make full use of -bh,
and sometimes you just want to answer the question
&ldquo;Does this address have access?&rdquo; without
bothering with any further details.

The
exim_checkaccess utility is a &rsquo;packaged&rsquo;
version of -bh. It takes two arguments, an IP address
and an email address:

exim_checkaccess
10.9.8.7 A.User [AT] a.example

The utility
runs a call to Exim with the -bh option, to test
whether the given email address would be accepted in a RCPT
command in a TCP/IP connection from the host with the given
IP address. The output of the utility is either the word
&rsquo;accepted&rsquo;, or the SMTP error response, for
example:

Rejected: 
550 Relay not permitted

When running
this test, the utility uses &ldquo;<>&rdquo; as the
envelope sender address for the MAIL command, but you can
change this by providing additional options. These are
passed directly to the Exim command. For example, to specify
that the test is to be run with the sender address
&ldquo;himself [AT] there.example&rdquo; you can use:

exim_checkaccess
10.9.8.7 A.User [AT] a.example \ 
-f himself [AT] there.example

Note that these
additional Exim command line items must be given after the
two mandatory arguments.
