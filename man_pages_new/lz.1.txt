NAME

lz - gunzips
and shows a listing of a gzip&rsquo;d tar&rsquo;d
archive

SYNOPSIS

lz
file

DESCRIPTION

lz
provides a listing of a gzip&rsquo;d tar&rsquo;d archive,
that is a tar(1) archive compressed with the
gzip(1) utility. It is not strictly necessary on
Debian GNU/Linux, because the GNU tar(1) program
provides the same capability with the command

tar -tzf
file

but this
utility is provided in the mtools package for other
platforms and is retained here for completeness.
