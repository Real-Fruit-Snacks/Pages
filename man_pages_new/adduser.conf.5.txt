NAME

/etc/adduser.conf
&minus; configuration file for adduser(8) and
addgroup(8).

DESCRIPTION

The file
/etc/adduser.conf contains defaults for the programs
adduser(8) , addgroup(8) , deluser(8)
and delgroup(8). Each line holds a single value pair
in the form option = value. Double or single
quotes are allowed around the value, as is whitespace around
the equals sign. Comment lines must have a hash sign (#) in
the first column.

The valid
configuration options are:

DSHELL

The login shell to be used for all new users. Defaults
to /bin/bash.

DHOME

The directory in which new home directories should be
created. Defaults to /home.

GROUPHOMES

If this is set to yes,
the home directories will be created as
/home/[groupname]/user. Defaults to no.

LETTERHOMES

If this is set to yes,
then the home directories created will have an extra
directory inserted which is the first letter of the
loginname. For example: /home/u/user. Defaults to
no.

SKEL

The directory from which skeletal user configuration
files should be copied. Defaults to /etc/skel.

FIRST_SYSTEM_UID and
LAST_SYSTEM_UID

specify an inclusive range of
UIDs from which system UIDs can be dynamically allocated.
Default to 100 - 999. Please note that system
software, such as the users allocated by the base-passwd
package, may assume that UIDs less than 100 are
unallocated.

FIRST_UID and
LAST_UID

specify an inclusive range of
UIDs from which normal user&rsquo;s UIDs can be dynamically
allocated. Default to 1000 - 59999.

FIRST_SYSTEM_GID and
LAST_SYSTEM_GID

specify an inclusive range of
GIDs from which system GIDs can be dynamically allocated.
Default to 100 - 999.

FIRST_GID and
LAST_GID

specify an inclusive range of
GIDs from which normal group&rsquo;s GIDs can be dynamically
allocated. Default to 1000 - 59999.

USERGROUPS

If this is set to yes,
then each created user will be given their own group to use.
If this is no, then each created user will be placed
in the group whose GID is USERS_GID (see below). The
default is yes.

USERS_GID

If USERGROUPS is
no, then USERS_GID is the GID given to all
newly-created users. The default value is 100.

DIR_MODE

If set to a valid value (e.g.
0755 or 755), directories created will have the specified
permissions as umask. Otherwise 0755 is used as default.

SETGID_HOME

If this is set to yes,
then home directories for users with their own group (
USERGROUPS=yes ) will have the setgid bit set. This
was the default setting for adduser versions 

QUOTAUSER

If set to a nonempty value, new
users will have quotas copied from that user. The default is
empty.

NAME_REGEX

User and group names are
checked against this regular expression. If the name
doesn&rsquo;t match this regexp, user and group creation in
adduser is refused unless --force-badname is set. With
--force-badname set, only weak checks are performed. The
default is the most conservative ^[a-z][-a-z0-9]*$.

SKEL_IGNORE_REGEX

Files in /etc/skel/ are checked
against this regex, and not copied to the newly created home
directory if they match. This is by default set to the
regular expression matching files left over from unmerged
config files (dpkg-(old|new|dist)).

ADD_EXTRA_GROUPS

Setting this to something other
than 0 (the default) will cause adduser to add newly created
non-system users to the list of groups defined by
EXTRA_GROUPS (below).

EXTRA_GROUPS

This is the list of groups that
new non-system users will be added to. By default, this list
is &rsquo;dialout cdrom floppy audio video plugdev users
games&rsquo;.

NOTES

VALID
NAMES

adduser and addgroup enforce
conformity to IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, which allows only the
following characters to appear in group and user names:
letters, digits, underscores, periods, at signs (@) and
dashes. The name may no start with a dash. The "$"
sign is allowed at the end of usernames (to conform to
samba).

An additional
check can be adjusted via the configuration parameter
NAME_REGEX to enforce a local policy.
