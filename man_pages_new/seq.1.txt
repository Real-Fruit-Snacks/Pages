NAME

seq - print
sequences of numbers

SYNOPSIS

seq [
-w ] [ -fformat ] [ first [
incr ] ] last

DESCRIPTION

Seq
prints a sequence of numbers, one per line, from
first (default 1) to as near last as possible,
in increments of incr (default 1). The loop is:

for(val = min;
val 

The numbers are
interpreted as floating point.

Normally
integer values are printed as decimal integers. The options
are

-fformat

Use the print(3)-style format print for
printing each (floating point) number. The default is

-w

Equalize the widths of all numbers by padding with
leading zeros as necessary. Not effective with option
-f, nor with numbers in exponential notation.

EXAMPLES

seq 0 .05
.1

Print 0 0.05 0.1 (on
separate lines).

seq -w 0 .05 .1

Print 0.00 0.05
0.10.

BUGS

Option
-w always surveys every value in advance. Thus seq -w
1000000000 is a painful way to get an &rsquo;infinite&rsquo;
sequence.
