DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of the samba(7) suite.

winbindd is a
daemon that provides a number of services to the Name
Service Switch capability found in most modern C libraries,
to arbitrary applications via PAM and ntlm_auth and to Samba
itself.

Even if winbind
is not used for nsswitch, it still provides a service to
smbd, ntlm_auth and the pam_winbind.so PAM module, by
managing connections to domain controllers. In this
configuration the idmap config * :
range parameter is not
required. (This is known as &rsquo;netlogon proxy only
mode'.)

The
Name Service Switch allows user and system information to be
obtained from different databases services such as NIS or
DNS. The exact behaviour can be configured through the
/etc/nsswitch.conf file. Users and groups are allocated as
they are resolved to a range of user and group ids specified
by the administrator of the Samba system.

The
service provided by winbindd is called &rsquo;winbind' and
can be used to resolve user and group information from a
Windows NT server. The service can also provide
authentication services via an associated PAM
module.

The
pam_winbind module supports the auth, account
and password module-types. It should be noted that
the account module simply performs a getpwnam() to
verify that the system can obtain a uid for the user, as the
domain controller has already performed access control. If
the libnss_winbind library has been correctly installed, or
an alternate source of names configured, this should always
succeed.

The
following nsswitch databases are implemented by the winbindd
service:

hosts

This
feature is only available on IRIX. User information
traditionally stored in the hosts(5) file and used by
gethostbyname(3) functions. Names are resolved through the
WINS server or by broadcast.

passwd

User
information traditionally stored in the passwd(5) file and
used by getpwent(3) functions.

group

Group
information traditionally stored in the group(5) file and
used by getgrent(3) functions.

For
example, the following simple configuration in the
/etc/nsswitch.conf file can be used to initially resolve
user and group information from /etc/passwd and /etc/group
and then from the Windows NT server.

passwd:
files winbind 
group: files winbind 
## only available on IRIX: use winbind to resolve hosts:

# hosts: files dns winbind 
## All other NSS enabled systems should use libnss_wins.so
like this: 
hosts: files dns wins

The
following simple configuration in the /etc/nsswitch.conf
file can be used to initially resolve hostnames from
/etc/hosts and then from the WINS server.

hosts:

files wins

OPTIONS

-D|--daemon

If
specified, this parameter causes the server to operate as a
daemon. That is, it detaches itself and runs in the
background on the appropriate port. This switch is assumed
if winbindd is executed on the command line of a
shell.

-i|--interactive

Tells
winbindd to not become a daemon and detach from the current
terminal. This option is used by developers when interactive
debugging of winbindd is required. winbindd also logs to
standard output, as if the -S parameter had been
given.

-F|--foreground

If
specified, this parameter causes the main winbindd process
to not daemonize, i.e. double-fork and disassociate with the
terminal. Child processes are still created as normal to
service each connection request, but the main process does
not exit. This operation mode is suitable for running
winbindd under process supervisors such as supervise and
svscan from Daniel J. Bernstein's daemontools package, or
the AIX process monitor.

--no-process-group

Do not
create a new process group for winbindd.

-n|--no-caching

Disable
some caching. This means winbindd will often have to wait
for a response from the domain controller before it can
respond to a client and this thus makes things slower. The
results will however be more accurate, since results from
the cache might not be up-to-date. This might also
temporarily hang winbindd if the DC doesn't respond. This
does not disable the samlogon cache, which is required for
group membership tracking in trusted
environments.

-d|--debuglevel=DEBUGLEVEL,
--debug-stdout

level
is an integer from 0 to 10. The default value if this
parameter is not specified is 0.

The
higher this value, the more detail will be logged to the log
files about the activities of the server. At level 0, only
critical errors and serious warnings will be logged. Level 1
is a reasonable level for day-to-day running - it generates
a small amount of information about operations carried
out.

Levels
above 1 will generate considerable amounts of log data, and
should only be used when investigating a problem. Levels
above 3 are designed for use only by developers and generate
HUGE amounts of log data, most of which is extremely
cryptic.

Note
that specifying this parameter here will override the
log level
parameter in the /etc/samba/smb.conf
file. This will redirect debug output to STDOUT. By default
server daemons are logging to a log file.

--configfile=CONFIGFILE

The file
specified contains the configuration details required by the
server. The information in this file includes
server-specific information such as what printcap file to
use, as well as descriptions of all the services that the
server is to provide. See /etc/samba/smb.conf for more
information. The default configuration file name is
determined at compile time.

--option==

Set the
smb.conf(5) option "" to value
"" from the command line. This
overrides compiled-in defaults and options read from the
configuration file. If a name or a value includes a space,
wrap whole --option=name=value into quotes.

-l|--log-basename=logdirectory

Base
directory name for log/debug files. The parent process uses
filename log.winbindd, the child process uses filename
log.wb-. The log file is never removed by
winbindd.

--leak-report

Enable
talloc leak reporting on exit.

--leak-report-full

Enable
full talloc leak reporting on exit.

-V|--version

Prints
the program version number.

-?|--help

Print a
summary of command line options.

--usage

Display
brief usage message.

NAME AND ID RESOLUTION

Users
and groups on a Windows NT server are assigned a security id
(SID) which is globally unique when the user or group is
created. To convert the Windows NT user or group into a unix
user or group, a mapping between SIDs and unix user and
group ids is required. This is one of the jobs that winbindd
performs.

As
winbindd users and groups are resolved from a server, user
and group ids are allocated from a specified range. This is
done on a first come, first served basis, although all
existing users and groups will be mapped as soon as a client
performs a user or group enumeration command. The allocated
unix ids are stored in a database and will be
remembered.

WARNING:
The SID to unix id database is the only location where the
user and group mappings are stored by winbindd. If this
store is deleted or corrupted, there is no way for winbindd
to determine which user and group ids correspond to Windows
NT user and group rids.

CONFIGURATION

Configuration
of the winbindd daemon is done through configuration
parameters in the smb.conf(5) file. All parameters
should be specified in the [global] section of
smb.conf.

&bull;
winbind separator

&bull;
idmap config * :
range

&bull;
idmap config * :
backend

&bull;
winbind cache time

&bull;
winbind enum users

&bull;
winbind enum groups

&bull;
template homedir

&bull;
template shell

&bull;
winbind use default
domain

&bull;
winbind: rpc only
Setting this parameter forces winbindd
to use RPC instead of LDAP to retrieve information from
Domain Controllers.

EXAMPLE SETUP

To
setup winbindd for user and group lookups plus
authentication from a domain controller use something like
the following setup. This was tested on an early Red Hat
Linux box.

In
/etc/nsswitch.conf put the following:

passwd:
files winbind 
group: files winbind

In
/etc/pam.d/* replace the 
auth lines with something like this:

auth
required /lib/security/pam_securetty.so

auth required

/lib/security/pam_nologin.so 

auth
sufficient /lib/security/pam_winbind.so 
auth required /lib/security/pam_unix.so \ 
use_first_pass shadow nullok

Note

The PAM module pam_unix has recently replaced the module
pam_pwdb. Some Linux systems use the module pam_unix2 in
place of pam_unix.

Note
in particular the use of the sufficient keyword and
the use_first_pass keyword.

Now
replace the account lines with this:

account
required /lib/security/pam_winbind.so

The
next step is to join the domain. To do that use the net
program like this:

net
join -S PDC -U Administrator

The
username after the -U can be any Domain user that has
administrator privileges on the machine. Substitute the name
or IP of your PDC for "PDC".

Next
copy libnss_winbind.so to /lib and pam_winbind.so to
/lib/security. A symbolic link needs to be made from
/lib/libnss_winbind.so to /lib/libnss_winbind.so.2. If you
are using an older version of glibc then the target of the
link should be /lib/libnss_winbind.so.1.

Finally,
setup a smb.conf(5) containing directives like the
following:

[global]

winbind separator = +

winbind
cache time = 10 
template shell = /bin/bash 
template homedir = /home/%D/%U 
idmap config * : range = 10000-20000 
workgroup = DOMAIN 
security = domain 
password server = *

Now
start winbindd and you should find that your user and group
database is expanded to include your NT users and groups,
and that you can login to your unix box as a domain user,
using the DOMAIN+user syntax for the username. You may wish
to use the commands getent passwd and getent group to
confirm the correct operation of winbindd.

NOTES

The
following notes are useful when configuring and running
winbindd:

PAM
is really easy to misconfigure. Make sure you know what you
are doing when modifying PAM configuration files. It is
possible to set up PAM such that you can no longer log into
your system.

If
more than one UNIX machine is running winbindd, then in
general the user and groups ids allocated by winbindd will
not be the same. The user and group ids will only be valid
for the local machine, unless a shared
idmap config * : backend
is configured.

If
the Windows NT SID to UNIX user and group id mapping file is
damaged or destroyed then the mappings will be
lost.

SIGNALS

The
following signals can be used to manipulate the winbindd
daemon.

SIGHUP

Reload
the smb.conf(5) file and apply any parameter changes
to the running version of winbindd. This signal also clears
any cached user and group information. The list of other
domains trusted by winbindd is also reloaded.

Instead
of sending a SIGHUP signal, a request to reload
configuration file may be sent using smbcontrol(1)
program.

SIGUSR2

The
SIGUSR2 signal will cause winbindd to write status
information to the winbind log file.

Log
files are stored in the filename specified by the log file
parameter.

FILES

/etc/nsswitch.conf(5)

Name
service switch configuration file.

/run/samba/winbindd/pipe

The UNIX
pipe over which clients communicate with the winbindd
program. For security reasons, the winbind client will only
attempt to connect to the winbindd daemon if both the
/run/samba/winbindd directory and /run/samba/winbindd/pipe
file are owned by root.

winbindd
socket directory overrides
this default.

$STATEDIR/winbindd_privileged/pipe

The UNIX
pipe over which 'privileged' clients communicate with the
winbindd program. For security reasons, access to some
winbindd functions - like those needed by the ntlm_auth
utility - is restricted. By default, only users in the
'root' group will get this access, however the administrator
may change the group permissions on
$STATEDIR/winbindd_privileged to allow programs like 'squid'
to use ntlm_auth. Note that the winbind client will only
attempt to connect to the winbindd daemon if both the
$STATEDIR/winbindd_privileged directory and
$STATEDIR/winbindd_privileged/pipe file are owned by
root.

state
dir controls what $STATEDIR
refers to.

/lib/libnss_winbind.so.X

Implementation
of name service switch library.

$STATEDIR/winbindd_idmap.tdb

Storage
for the Windows NT rid to UNIX user/group id mapping. The
directory is specified when Samba is initially compiled
using the --with-statedir option or
state
dir. The default directory
in this installation is /var/lib/samba.

$LOCKDIR/winbindd_cache.tdb

Storage
for cached user and group information.
