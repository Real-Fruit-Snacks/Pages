ppm2str &minus;
converts the ppm files to video streams

SYNOPSIS

ppm2str
filename maxframe

DESCRIPTION

Vstream is a
collection of utilities for capturing reasonably high
quality video from a v4l device (specifically configured for
bttv). A simultaneous audio track is also captured.

This utility -
ppm2str - converts the ppm files to video
streams.

OPTIONS

filename

input filename in fprintf
format eg: ovl:%03d (NOTE: no .ppm at the end, this gets
appended automatically, the : must be ther - this denotes
root filename).

maxframe

the maximum frame number.

NOTES

From the above
example: ovl:000.ppm and ovl:.ppm must
exist, others are not necessary, the highest existing frame
number is fetched for editing. eg: if only frame 0 and frame
 exist, then frame 0 to frame
 will be frame 0, anf frame
 will be frame...
