NAME

systemd-network-generator.service,
systemd-network-generator - Generate network configuration
from the kernel command line

SYNOPSIS

systemd-network-generator.service

/usr/lib/systemd/systemd-network-generator

DESCRIPTION

systemd-network-generator.service
is a system service that translates ip= and related
settings on the kernel command line (see below) into
systemd.network(5), systemd.netdev(5), and
systemd.link(5) configuration files understood by
systemd-networkd.service(8) and
systemd-udevd.service(8).

Files are
generated in /run/systemd/network/.

Note: despite
the name, this generator executes as a normal systemd
service and is not an implementation of the
systemd.generator(7) concept.

KERNEL COMMAND LINE OPTIONS

This tool
understands the following options:

ip=,
nameserver=, rd.route=, rd.peerdns=

Translated into
systemd.network(5) files.

In addition to
the parameters dracut.cmdline(7) defines the
ip= option accepts the special value
"link-local". If selected, the network interfaces
will be configured for link-local addressing (IPv4LL,
IPv6LL) only, DHCP or IPv6RA will not be enabled.

Added in
version 245.

ifname=,
net.ifname_policy=

Translated into
systemd.link(5) files.

Added in
version 245.

vlan=,
bond=, bridge=, bootdev=

Translated into
systemd.netdev(5) files.

Added in
version 245.

See
dracut.cmdline(7) and systemd-udevd.service(8)
for option syntax and details.

CREDENTIALS

systemd-network-generator
supports the service credentials logic as implemented by
ImportCredential=/LoadCredential=/SetCredential=
(see systemd.exec(5) for details). The following
credentials are used when passed in:

network.conf.*,
network.link.*, network.netdev.*,
network.network.*

These credentials should
contain valid networkd.conf(5),
systemd.link(5), systemd.netdev(5),
systemd.network(5) configuration data. From each
matching credential a separate file is created. Example: a
passed credential network.link.50-foobar will be copied into
a configuration file 50-foobar.link.

Note that the
resulting files are created world-readable, it's hence
recommended to not include secrets in these credentials, but
supply them via separate credentials directly to
systemd-networkd.service.

Added in
version 256.

Note that by
default the systemd-network-generator.service unit file is
set up to inherit the these credentials from the service
manager.
