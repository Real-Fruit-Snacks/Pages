Description

GNU
soelim is a preprocessor for the groff(7)
document formatting system. soelim works as a filter
to eliminate source requests in roff(7) input files;
that is, it replaces lines of the form &ldquo;.so
included-file&rdquo; within each text
input-file with the contents of included-file,
recursively. By default, it writes lf requests as
well to record the name and line number of each
input-file and included-file, so that any
diagnostics produced by later processing can be accurately
traced to the original input. Options allow this information
to be suppressed (-r) or supplied in TeX comments
instead (-t). In the absence of input-file
arguments, soelim reads the standard input stream.
Output is written to the standard output stream.

If the name of
a macro-file contains a backslash, use \\ or
\e to embed it. To embed a space, write
&ldquo;\ &rdquo; (backslash followed by a
space). Any other escape sequence in macro-file,
including &ldquo;\[rs]&rdquo;, prevents soelim
from replacing the source request.

The dot must be
at the beginning of a line and must be followed by
&ldquo;so&rdquo; without intervening spaces or tabs
for soelim to handle it. This convention allows
source requests to be &ldquo;protected&rdquo; from
processing by soelim, for instance as part of macro
definitions or &ldquo;if&rdquo; requests.

There must also
be at least one space between &ldquo;so&rdquo; and
its macro-file argument. The -C option
overrides this requirement.

The foregoing
is the limit of soelim&rsquo;s understanding of the
roff language; it does not, for example, replace the
input line

.if 1 .so otherfile

with the contents of
otherfile. With its -r option, therefore,
soelim can be used to process text files in general,
to flatten a tree of input documents.

soelim
was designed to handle situations where the target of a
roff source request requires a preprocessor such as
eqn(1), pic(1), refer(1), or
tbl(1). The usual processing sequence of
groff(1) is as follows.

input sourced

file file 
&#9130; &#9130; 
&darr; &darr; 
preprocessor &#9135;&rarr; troff &#9135;&rarr; postprocessor

&#9130; 
&darr; 
output 
file

That is, files
sourced with &ldquo;so&rdquo; are normally read
only by the formatter, troff. soelim is
not required for troff to source files.

If a file to be
sourced should also be preprocessed, it must already be read
before the input file passes through the
preprocessor. soelim, normally invoked via
groff&rsquo;s -s option, handles this.

Options

--help
displays a usage message, while -v and
--version show version information; all exit
afterward.

-C

Recognize an input line starting with .so even if
a character other than a space or newline follows.

-I dir

Search the directory dir path for input-
and included-files. -I may be specified more
than once; each dir is searched in the given order.
To search the current working directory before others, add
&ldquo;-I .&rdquo; at the desired place; it is
otherwise searched last.

-r

Write files &ldquo;raw&rdquo;; do not add lf
requests. 

-t

Emit TeX comment lines starting with
&ldquo;%&rdquo; indicating the current file and line
number, rather than lf requests for the same
purpose. 

If both
-r and -t are given, the last one specified
controls.
