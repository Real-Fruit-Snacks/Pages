The architecture is modular, so that new tools can be created easily and without disturbing the existing structure.\n\nTOOLS\n       The Valgrind distribution currently includes six production-quality tools:\n\n       Memcheck\n              A memory error detector. It can detect the following problems that are common in C and C++ programs: accessing memory you shouldn't, using undefined values, incorrect freeing of heap memory, memory leaks, etc.\n\n       Cachegrind\n              A cache and branch-prediction profiler. It performs detailed simulation of the I1, D1 and L2 caches in your CPU and so can accurately pinpoint the sources of cache misses in your code.\n\n       Callgrind\n              A callgraph generating cache and branch prediction profiler. It generates call graphs showing function call relationships and annotates them with cache miss information.\n\n       Helgrind\n              A thread error detector. Helgrind finds data races in multithreaded programs.\n\n       DRD    A thread error detector. DRD is a tool for detecting errors in multithreaded C and C++ programs.\n\n       Massif A heap profiler. Massif performs detailed heap profiling by taking regular snapshots of a program's heap.\n\nCORE OPTIONS\n       --tool=<toolname> [default: memcheck]\n              Run the Valgrind tool called toolname, e.g. memcheck, cachegrind, callgrind, helgrind, drd, massif, lackey, none, exp-sgcheck, exp-bbv, exp-dhat, etc.\n\n       -h, --help\n              Show help for all options, both for the core and for the selected tool.\n\n       --help-debug\n              Same as --help, but also lists debugging options which usually are only of use to the Valgrind developers.\n\n       --version\n              Show the version number of the Valgrind core.\n\n       -q, --quiet\n              Run silently, and only print error messages.\n\n       -v, --verbose\n              Be more verbose.\n\n       --track-origins=<yes|no> [default: no]\n              Controls whether Memcheck tracks the origin of uninitialised values.\n\n       --leak-check=<no|summary|yes|full> [default: summary]\n              When enabled, search for memory leaks when the client program finishes.\n\n       --show-leak-kinds=<set> [default: definite,possible]\n              Specifies the leak kinds to show in a full leak search.\n\n       --gen-suppressions=<yes|no|all> [default: no]\n              When set to yes, Valgrind will pause after every error shown and print the line \"---- Print suppression ? --- [Return/N/n/Y/y/C/c] ----\".\n\nEXAMPLES\n       valgrind ./my_program\n              Run my_program under Memcheck (default tool)\n\n       valgrind --tool=cachegrind ./my_program\n              Run my_program under Cachegrind\n\n       valgrind --leak-check=full ./my_program\n              Run with full memory leak checking\n\n       valgrind --track-origins=yes ./my_program\n              Track origins of uninitialized values\n\n       valgrind --tool=callgrind ./my_program\n              Generate call graph profiling data\n\n       valgrind --tool=helgrind ./threaded_program\n              Check for thread errors in multithreaded program\n\n       valgrind --tool=massif ./my_program\n              Profile heap memory usage\n\n       valgrind --suppressions=my.supp ./my_program\n              Use custom suppression file\n\nEXIT STATUS\n       Valgrind returns the exit status of the program being debugged, or 1 if an internal error occurs.\n\nFILES\n       ~/.valgrindrc\n              User configuration file\n\n       $PREFIX/lib/valgrind/\n              Valgrind tool directory\n\nSEE ALSO\n       gdb(1), strace(1), ltrace(1)\n\n       Valgrind User Manual: http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/\n\nBUGS\n       Report bugs to: valgrind-users@lists.sourceforge.net\n\nAUTHOR\n       Valgrind was originally written by Julian Seward, and is now maintained by the Valgrind development team.\n\nValgrind 3.19.0                 January 2025                         VALGRIND(1)" },

It continues to send packets with low TTL, noting the response time of the intervening routers. This allows mtr to print the response percentage and response times of the internet route to HOSTNAME. A sudden increase in packet loss or response time is often an indication of a bad (or simply overloaded) link.\n\nOPTIONS\n       -h, --help\n              Print the summary of command line argument options.\n\n       -v, --version\n              Print the installed version of mtr.\n\n       -r, --report\n              This option puts mtr into report mode. When in this mode, mtr will run for the number of cycles specified by the -c option, and then print statistics and exit.\n\n       -w, --report-wide\n              This option puts mtr into wide report mode. When in this mode, mtr will not cut hostnames in the report.\n\n       -c COUNT, --report-cycles COUNT\n              Use this option to set the number of pings sent to determine both the machines on the network and the reliability of those machines. Each cycle lasts one second.\n\n       -s BYTES, --psize BYTES\n              This option sets the packet size used for probing. It is in bytes, inclusive IP and ICMP headers.\n\n       -t, --curses\n              Use this option to force mtr to use the curses based terminal interface (if available).\n\n       -n, --no-dns\n              Use this option to force mtr to display numeric IP numbers and not try to resolve the host names.\n\n       -g, --gtk\n              Use this option to force mtr to use the GTK+ based X11 window interface (if available).\n\n       -p, --split\n              Use this option to set mtr to spit out a format that is suitable for a split-user interface.\n\n       -l, --raw\n              Use this option to tell mtr to use the raw output format.\n\n       -a IP.ADD.RE.SS, --address IP.ADD.RE.SS\n              Use this option to bind the outgoing packets' socket to specific interface, so that any packet will be sent through this interface.\n\n       -i SECONDS, --interval SECONDS\n              Use this option to specify the positive number of seconds between ICMP ECHO requests. The default value for this parameter is one second.\n\n       -m NUMBER, --max-ttl NUMBER\n              Specifies the maximum number of hops (max time-to-live value) traceroute will probe. The default is 30.\n\n       -f NUMBER, --first-ttl NUMBER\n              Specifies with what TTL to start. Defaults to 1.\n\n       -B NUMBER, --bitpattern NUMBER\n              Specifies bit pattern to use in payload. Should be within range 0 - 255.\n\n       -Q NUMBER, --tos NUMBER\n              Specifies value for type of service field in IP header.

If $SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE is not set at all, secure mode is enabled if the effective UID is not the same as the owner of the terminal device. In secure mode, LESSSECURE=1 will be set when invoking the pager, and the pager shall disable commands that open or create new files or start new subprocesses. When $SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE is not set at all, pagers which are not known to implement secure mode will not be used.

It compiles C++ source files into executable programs or object files.\n\n       When you invoke g++, it normally does preprocessing, compilation, assembly and linking. The overall options allow you to stop this process at an intermediate stage.\n\nOPTIONS\n       -c     Compile or assemble the source files, but do not link. The linking stage simply is not done. The ultimate output is in the form of an object file for each source file.\n\n       -S     Stop after the stage of compilation proper; do not assemble. The output is in the form of an assembler code file for each non-assembler input file specified.\n\n       -E     Stop after the preprocessing stage; do not run the compiler proper. The output is in the form of preprocessed source code, which is sent to the standard output.\n\n       -o file\n              Place output in file. This applies to whatever sort of output is being produced, whether it be an executable file, an object file, an assembler file or preprocessed C code.\n\n       -g     Produce debugging information in the operating system's native format (stabs, COFF, XCOFF, or DWARF 2).

If $SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE is not set at all, secure mode is enabled if the effective UID is not the same as the owner of the terminal device. In secure mode, LESSSECURE=1 will be set when invoking the pager, and the pager shall disable commands that open or create new files or start new subprocesses. When $SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE is not set at all, pagers which are not known to implement secure mode will not be used. (Currently only less(1) implements secure mode.)\n\n       $SYSTEMD_COLORS\n              The value must be a boolean. Controls whether colorized output should be generated.

If neither $SYSTEMD_PAGER nor $PAGER are set, a set of well-known pager implementations are tried in turn, including less(1) and more(1), until one is found. If no pager implementation is discovered no pager is invoked. Setting this environment variable to an empty string or the value \"cat\" is equivalent to passing --no-pager.\n\n       $SYSTEMD_LESS\n              Override the options passed to less (by default \"FRSXMK\").\n\n       $SYSTEMD_LESSCHARSET\n              Override the charset passed to less (by default \"utf-8\", if the invoking terminal is determined to be UTF-8 compatible).\n\n       $SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE\n              Takes a boolean argument. When true, the \"secure\" mode of the pager is enabled; if false, disabled. If $SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE is not set at all, secure mode is enabled if the effective UID is not the same as the owner of the terminal device. In secure mode, LESSSECURE=1 will be set when invoking the pager, and the pager shall disable commands that open or create new files or start new subprocesses. When $SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE is not set at all, pagers which are not known to implement secure mode will not be used. (Currently only less(1) implements secure mode.)\n\n       $SYSTEMD_COLORS\n              The value must be a boolean. Controls whether colorized output should be generated. This can be specified to override the decision that systemd makes based on $TERM and what the console is connected to.\n\n       $SYSTEMD_URLIFY\n              The value must be a boolean.

If neither $SYSTEMD_PAGER nor $PAGER are set, a set of well-known pager implementations are tried in turn, including less(1) and more(1), until one is found. If no pager implementation is discovered no pager is invoked. Setting this environment variable to an empty string or the value \"cat\" is equivalent to passing --no-pager.\n\n       $SYSTEMD_LESS\n              Override the options passed to less (by default \"FRSXMK\").\n\n       $SYSTEMD_LESSCHARSET\n              Override the charset passed to less (by default \"utf-8\", if the invoking terminal is determined to be UTF-8 compatible).\n\n       $SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE\n              Takes a boolean argument. When true, the \"secure\" mode of the pager is enabled; if false, disabled. If $SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE is not set at all, secure mode is enabled if the effective UID is not the same as the owner of the terminal device. In secure mode, LESSSECURE=1 will be set when invoking the pager, and the pager shall disable commands that open or create new files or start new subprocesses. When $SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE is not set at all, pagers which are not known to implement secure mode will not be used. (Currently only less(1) implements secure mode.)\n\n       $SYSTEMD_COLORS\n              The value must be a boolean. Controls whether colorized output should be generated. This can be specified to override the decision that systemd makes based on $TERM and what the console is connected to.\n\n       $SYSTEMD_URLIFY\n              The value must be a boolean. Controls whether clickable links should be generated in the output for terminal emulators supporting this. This can be specified to override the decision that systemd makes based on $TERM and other conditions.\n\nSEE ALSO\n       systemd(1), journalctl(1), loginctl(1), machinectl(1), systemd.unit(5), systemd.special(7), wall(1), systemd.preset(5), systemd.generator(7), glob(7)\n\nsystemd 249                      January 2025                           FSCK(8)" },

The memory is not initialized. If size is 0, then malloc() returns either NULL, or a unique pointer value that can later be successfully passed to free().\n\nRETURN VALUE\n       The malloc() and calloc() functions return a pointer to the allocated memory, which is suitably aligned for any built-in type. On error, these functions return NULL. NULL may also be returned by a successful call to malloc() with a size of zero, or by a successful call to calloc() with nmemb or size equal to zero.\n\nATTRIBUTES\n       For an explanation of the terms used in this section, see attributes(7).\n\n       ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n       │Interface                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               │ Attribute     │ Value   │\n       ├────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n       │malloc()                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               │ Thread safety │ MT-Safe │\n       └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n\nCONFORMING TO\n       C89, C99, POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008.\n\nSEE ALSO\n       Full documentation for GNU C Library functions at <https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/>\n\nCOLOPHON\n       This page is part of release 5.13 of the Linux man-pages project.\n\nGNU                              January 2025                              MALLOC(3)" },

If neither $SYSTEMD_PAGER nor $PAGER are set, a set of well-known pager implementations are tried in turn, including less(1) and more(1), until one is found. If no pager implementation is discovered no pager is invoked. Setting this environment variable to an empty string or the value \"cat\" is equivalent to passing --no-pager.\n\n       $SYSTEMD_LESS\n              Override the options passed to less (by default \"FRSXMK\").\n\n       $SYSTEMD_LESSCHARSET\n              Override the charset passed to less (by default \"utf-8\", if the invoking terminal is determined to be UTF-8 compatible).\n\n       $SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE\n              Takes a boolean argument. When true, the \"secure\" mode of the pager is enabled; if false, disabled. If $SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE is not set at all, secure mode is enabled if the effective UID is not the same as the owner of the terminal device. In secure mode, LESSSECURE=1 will be set when invoking the pager, and the pager shall disable commands that open or create new files or start new subprocesses. When $SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE is not set at all, pagers which are not known to implement secure mode will not be used. (Currently only less(1) implements secure mode.)\n\n       $SYSTEMD_COLORS\n              The value must be a boolean. Controls whether colorized output should be generated. This can be specified to override the decision that systemd makes based on $TERM and what the console is connected to.\n\n       $SYSTEMD_URLIFY\n              The value must be a boolean. Controls whether clickable links should be generated in the output for terminal emulators supporting this. This can be specified to override the decision that systemd makes based on $TERM and other conditions.\n\nSEE ALSO\n       systemd(1), journalctl(1), loginctl(1), machinectl(1), systemd.unit(5), systemd.special(7), wall(1), systemd.preset(5), systemd.generator(7), glob(7)\n\nsystemd 249                      January 2025                           MKFS(8)" },

If neither $SYSTEMD_PAGER nor $PAGER are set, a set of well-known pager implementations are tried in turn, including less(1) and more(1), until one is found. If no pager implementation is discovered no pager is invoked. Setting this environment variable to an empty string or the value \"cat\" is equivalent to passing --no-pager.\n\n       $SYSTEMD_LESS\n              Override the options passed to less (by default \"FRSXMK\").\n\n       $SYSTEMD_LESSCHARSET\n              Override the charset passed to less (by default \"utf-8\", if the invoking terminal is determined to be UTF-8 compatible).\n\n       $SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE\n              Takes a boolean argument. When true, the \"secure\" mode of the pager is enabled; if false, disabled. If $SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE is not set at all, secure mode is enabled if the effective UID is not the same as the owner of the terminal device. In secure mode, LESSSECURE=1 will be set when invoking the pager, and the pager shall disable commands that open or create new files or start new subprocesses. When $SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE is not set at all, pagers which are not known to implement secure mode will not be used. (Currently only less(1) implements secure mode.)\n\n       $SYSTEMD_COLORS\n              The value must be a boolean. Controls whether colorized output should be generated. This can be specified to override the decision that systemd makes based on $TERM and what the console is connected to.\n\n       $SYSTEMD_URLIFY\n              The value must be a boolean. Controls whether clickable links should be generated in the output for terminal emulators supporting this. This can be specified to override the decision that systemd makes based on $TERM and other conditions.\n\nSEE ALSO\n       systemd(1), journalctl(1), loginctl(1), machinectl(1), systemd.unit(5), systemd.special(7), wall(1), systemd.preset(5), systemd.generator(7), glob(7)\n\nsystemd 249                      January 2025                           MOUNT(8)" },

If the specified file does not exist, it may optionally (if O_CREAT is specified in flags) be created by open().\n\nRETURN VALUE\n       open() returns the new file descriptor (a nonnegative integer), or -1 if an error occurred (in which case, errno is set appropriately).\n\nERRORS\n       EACCES The requested access to the file is not allowed, or search permission is denied for one of the directories in the path prefix of pathname, or the file did not exist yet and write access to the parent directory is not allowed.\n\n       EDQUOT Where O_CREAT is specified, the file does not exist, and the user's quota of disk blocks or inodes on the filesystem has been exhausted.\n\n       EEXIST pathname already exists and O_CREAT and O_EXCL were used.\n\n       EFAULT pathname points outside your accessible address space.\n\n       EFBIG  See EOVERFLOW.\n\n       EINTR  While blocked waiting to complete an open of a slow device (e.g., a FIFO; see fifo(7)), the call was interrupted by a signal handler; see signal(7).\n\n       EINVAL The filesystem does not support the O_DIRECT flag. See NOTES for more information.\n\n       EISDIR pathname refers to a directory and the access requested involved writing (that is, O_WRONLY or O_RDWR is set).\n\n       ELOOP  Too many symbolic links were encountered in resolving pathname.\n\n       EMFILE The per-process limit on the number of open file descriptors has been reached (see the description of RLIMIT_NOFILE in getrlimit(2)).\n\n       ENAMETOOLONG\n              pathname was too long.\n\n       ENFILE The system-wide limit on the total number of open files has been reached.\n\n       ENODEV pathname refers to a device special file and no corresponding device exists. (This is a Linux kernel bug; in this situation ENXIO must be returned.)\n\n       ENOENT O_CREAT is not set and the named file does not exist. Or, a directory component in pathname does not exist or is a dangling symbolic link.\n\n       ENOMEM The named file is a FIFO, but memory for the FIFO buffer cannot be allocated because the per-user hard limit on memory allocation for pipes has been reached and the caller is not privileged; see pipe(7).\n\n       ENOSPC pathname was to be created but the device containing pathname has no room for the new file.\n\n       ENOTDIR\n              A component used as a directory in pathname is not, in fact, a directory, or O_DIRECTORY was specified and pathname is not a directory.\n\n       ENXIO  O_NONBLOCK | O_WRONLY is set, the named file is a FIFO, and no process has the FIFO open for reading.\n\n       EOVERFLOW\n              pathname refers to a regular file that is too large to be opened. The usual scenario here is that an application compiled on a 32-bit platform without -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 tries to open a file whose size exceeds (1<<31)-1 bytes; see also O_LARGEFILE above.\n\n       EPERM  The O_NOATIME flag was specified, but the effective user ID of the caller did not match the owner of the file and the caller was not privileged.\n\n       EROFS  pathname refers to a file on a read-only filesystem and write access was requested.\n\n       ETXTBSY\n              pathname refers to an executable image which is currently being executed and write access was requested.\n\n       EWOULDBLOCK\n              The O_NONBLOCK flag was specified, and an incompatible lease was held on the file (see fcntl(2)).\n\nCONFORMING TO\n       POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, SVr4, 4.3BSD.\n\nNOTES\n       For more details on system call behavior, consult the system documentation.\n\nSEE ALSO\n       syscalls(2), errno(3), feature_test_macros(7)\n\nCOLOPHON\n       This page is part of release 5.13 of the Linux man-pages project.

When true, the \"secure\" mode of the pager is enabled; if false, disabled. If $SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE is not set at all, secure mode is enabled if the effective UID is not the same as the owner of the terminal device. In secure mode, LESSSECURE=1 will be set when invoking the pager, and the pager shall disable commands that open or create new files or start new subprocesses. When $SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE is not set at all, pagers which are not known to implement secure mode will not be used. (Currently only less(1) implements secure mode.)\n\n       $SYSTEMD_COLORS\n              The value must be a boolean. Controls whether colorized output should be generated.

The functions printf() and vprintf() write output to stdout, the standard output stream; fprintf() and vfprintf() write output to the given output stream; sprintf(), snprintf(), vsprintf() and vsnprintf() write to the character string str.\n\nRETURN VALUE\n       Upon successful return, these functions return the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings).\\n\\n       The functions snprintf() and vsnprintf() do not write more than size bytes (including the terminating null byte (\\0)). If the output was truncated due to this limit, then the return value is the number of characters (excluding the terminating null byte) which would have been written to the final string if enough space had been available. Thus, a return value of size or more means that the output was truncated. (See also below under NOTES.)\\n\\n       If an output error is encountered, a negative value is returned.\n\nATTRIBUTES\n       For an explanation of the terms used in this section, see attributes(7).\n\n       ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n       │Interface                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               │ Attribute     │ Value   │\n       ├────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n       │printf()                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               │ Thread safety │ MT-Safe locale │\n       └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n\nCONFORMING TO\n       C89, C99, POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008.\n\nSEE ALSO\n       Full documentation for GNU C Library functions at <https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/>\n\nCOLOPHON\n       This page is part of release 5.13 of the Linux man-pages project.\n\nGNU                              January 2025                              PRINTF(3)" },

It is not an error if this number is smaller than the number of bytes requested; this may happen for example because fewer bytes are actually available right now (maybe because we were close to end-of-file, or because we are reading from a pipe, or from a terminal), or because read() was interrupted by a signal. See also NOTES.\\n\\n       On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set appropriately. In this case, it is left unspecified whether the file position (if any) changes.\n\nERRORS\n       EAGAIN The file descriptor fd refers to a file other than a socket and has been marked nonblocking (O_NONBLOCK), and the read would block. See open(2) for further details on the O_NONBLOCK flag.\n\n       EAGAIN or EWOULDBLOCK\n              The file descriptor fd refers to a socket and has been marked nonblocking (O_NONBLOCK), and the read would block. POSIX.1-2001 allows either error to be returned for this case, and does not require these constants to have the same value, so a portable application should check for both possibilities.\n\n       EBADF  fd is not a valid file descriptor or is not open for reading.\n\n       EFAULT buf is outside your accessible address space.\n\n       EINTR  The call was interrupted by a signal before any data was read; see signal(7).\n\n       EINVAL fd is attached to an object which is unsuitable for reading; or the file was opened with the O_DIRECT flag, and either the address specified in buf, the value specified in count, or the file offset is not suitably aligned.\n\n       EINVAL fd was created via a call to timerfd_create(2) and the wrong size buffer was given to read(); see timerfd_create(2) for further information.\n\n       EIO    I/O error. This will happen for example when the process is in a background process group, tries to read from its controlling terminal, and either it is ignoring or blocking SIGTTIN or its process group is orphaned. It may also occur when there is a low-level I/O error while reading from a disk or tape. A further possible cause of EIO on networked filesystems is when an advisory lock had been taken out on the file descriptor and this lock has been lost. See the Lost locks section of fcntl(2) for further details.\n\n       EISDIR fd refers to a directory.\n\nCONFORMING TO\n       POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, SVr4, 4.3BSD.\n\nNOTES\n       For more details on system call behavior, consult the system documentation.\n\nSEE ALSO\n       syscalls(2), errno(3), feature_test_macros(7)\n\nCOLOPHON\n       This page is part of release 5.13 of the Linux man-pages project.

The resolver configuration file contains information that is read by the resolver routines the first time they are invoked by a process.\n\n       The file is designed to be human readable and contains a list of keywords with values that provide various types of resolver information.\n\nFORMAT\n       The configuration file consists of directives, one per line. Lines beginning with # are treated as comments.\n\n       nameserver name_server_IP_address\n              Internet address (in dot notation) of a name server that the resolver should query.\n\n       domain local_domain_name\n              Local domain name. Most queries for names within this domain can use short names relative to the local domain.\n\n       search search_list\n              Search list for host-name lookup. The search list is normally determined from the local domain name.\n\n       sortlist\n              Allows addresses returned by gethostbyname(3) to be sorted.\n\n       options\n              Allows certain internal resolver variables to be modified.\n\nEXAMPLES\n       # Example resolv.conf configuration\n       nameserver 8.8.8.8\n       nameserver 8.8.4.4\n       domain example.com\n       search example.com\n       options timeout:2 attempts:3\n\nFILES\n       /etc/resolv.conf\n              The resolver configuration file\n\n       /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/\n              Directory containing resolver configuration fragments\n\nSEE ALSO\n       gethostbyname(3), resolver(3), hostname(7), named(8), systemd-resolved(8)\n\nNOTES\n       The resolv.conf file is read by the resolver library routines. If this file does not exist, the default action is to query the name server on the local host.\n\n       Many modern Linux distributions use systemd-resolved or NetworkManager to manage DNS configuration, which may override or generate this file automatically.\n\nLinux                            January 2025                            RESOLV.CONF(5)" },

If no pager implementation is discovered no pager is invoked. Setting this environment variable to an empty string or the value \"cat\" is equivalent to passing --no-pager.\n\n       $SYSTEMD_LESS\n              Override the options passed to less (by default \"FRSXMK\").\n\n       $SYSTEMD_LESSCHARSET\n              Override the charset passed to less (by default \"utf-8\", if the invoking terminal is determined to be UTF-8 compatible).\n\n       $SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE\n              Takes a boolean argument. When true, the \"secure\" mode of the pager is enabled; if false, disabled. If $SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE is not set at all, secure mode is enabled if the effective UID is not the same as the owner of the terminal device. In secure mode, LESSSECURE=1 will be set when invoking the pager, and the pager shall disable commands that open or create new files or start new subprocesses. When $SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE is not set at all, pagers which are not known to implement secure mode will not be used. (Currently only less(1) implements secure mode.)\n\n       $SYSTEMD_COLORS\n              The value must be a boolean. Controls whether colorized output should be generated.

If no pager implementation is discovered no pager is invoked. Setting this environment variable to an empty string or the value \"cat\" is equivalent to passing --no-pager.\n\n       $SYSTEMD_LESS\n              Override the options passed to less (by default \"FRSXMK\").\n\n       $SYSTEMD_LESSCHARSET\n              Override the charset passed to less (by default \"utf-8\", if the invoking terminal is determined to be UTF-8 compatible).\n\n       $SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE\n              Takes a boolean argument. When true, the \"secure\" mode of the pager is enabled; if false, disabled. If $SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE is not set at all, secure mode is enabled if the effective UID is not the same as the owner of the terminal device.

If neither $SYSTEMD_PAGER nor $PAGER are set, a set of well-known pager implementations are tried in turn, including less(1) and more(1), until one is found. If no pager implementation is discovered no pager is invoked. Setting this environment variable to an empty string or the value \"cat\" is equivalent to passing --no-pager.\n\n       $SYSTEMD_LESS\n              Override the options passed to less (by default \"FRSXMK\").\n\n       $SYSTEMD_LESSCHARSET\n              Override the charset passed to less (by default \"utf-8\", if the invoking terminal is determined to be UTF-8 compatible).\n\n       $SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE\n              Takes a boolean argument. When true, the \"secure\" mode of the pager is enabled; if false, disabled. If $SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE is not set at all, secure mode is enabled if the effective UID is not the same as the owner of the terminal device. In secure mode, LESSSECURE=1 will be set when invoking the pager, and the pager shall disable commands that open or create new files or start new subprocesses. When $SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE is not set at all, pagers which are not known to implement secure mode will not be used. (Currently only less(1) implements secure mode.)\n\n       $SYSTEMD_COLORS\n              The value must be a boolean. Controls whether colorized output should be generated. This can be specified to override the decision that systemd makes based on $TERM and what the console is connected to.\n\n       $SYSTEMD_URLIFY\n              The value must be a boolean. Controls whether clickable links should be generated in the output for terminal emulators supporting this. This can be specified to override the decision that systemd makes based on $TERM and other conditions.\n\nSEE ALSO\n       systemd(1), journalctl(1), loginctl(1), machinectl(1), systemd.unit(5), systemd.special(7), wall(1), systemd.preset(5), systemd.generator(7), glob(7)\n\nsystemd 249                      January 2025                           SUDO(8)" },

If neither $SYSTEMD_PAGER nor $PAGER are set, a set of well-known pager implementations are tried in turn, including less(1) and more(1), until one is found. If no pager implementation is discovered no pager is invoked. Setting this environment variable to an empty string or the value \"cat\" is equivalent to passing --no-pager.\n\n       $SYSTEMD_LESS\n              Override the options passed to less (by default \"FRSXMK\").\n\n       $SYSTEMD_LESSCHARSET\n              Override the charset passed to less (by default \"utf-8\", if the invoking terminal is determined to be UTF-8 compatible).\n\n       $SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE\n              Takes a boolean argument. When true, the \"secure\" mode of the pager is enabled; if false, disabled. If $SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE is not set at all, secure mode is enabled if the effective UID is not the same as the owner of the terminal device. In secure mode, LESSSECURE=1 will be set when invoking the pager, and the pager shall disable commands that open or create new files or start new subprocesses. When $SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE is not set at all, pagers which are not known to implement secure mode will not be used. (Currently only less(1) implements secure mode.)\n\n       $SYSTEMD_COLORS\n              The value must be a boolean. Controls whether colorized output should be generated. This can be specified to override the decision that systemd makes based on $TERM and what the console is connected to.\n\n       $SYSTEMD_URLIFY\n              The value must be a boolean. Controls whether clickable links should be generated in the output for terminal emulators supporting this. This can be specified to override the decision that systemd makes based on $TERM and other conditions.\n\nSEE ALSO\n       systemd(1), journalctl(1), loginctl(1), machinectl(1), systemd.unit(5), systemd.special(7), wall(1), systemd.preset(5), systemd.generator(7), glob(7)\n\nsystemd 249                      January 2025                           UMOUNT(8)" },
