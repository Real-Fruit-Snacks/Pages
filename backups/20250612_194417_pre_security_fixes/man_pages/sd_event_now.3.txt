NAME

sd_event_now -
Retrieve current event loop iteration timestamp

SYNOPSIS

#include

int
sd_event_now(sd_event *event,
clockid_t clock,
uint64_t *usec); 

DESCRIPTION

sd_event_now()
returns the time when the most recent event loop iteration
began. A timestamp is taken right after returning from the
event sleep, and before dispatching any event sources. The
event parameter specifies the event loop object to
retrieve the timestamp from. The clock parameter
specifies the clock to retrieve the timestamp for, and is
one of CLOCK_REALTIME (or equivalently
CLOCK_REALTIME_ALARM), CLOCK_MONOTONIC, or
CLOCK_BOOTTIME (or equivalently
CLOCK_BOOTTIME_ALARM), see clock_gettime(2)
for more information on the various clocks. The retrieved
timestamp is stored in the usec parameter, in Î¼s
since the clock's epoch. If this function is invoked before
the first event loop iteration, the current time is
returned, as reported by clock_gettime(). To
distinguish this case from a regular invocation the return
value will be positive, and zero when the returned timestamp
refers to an actual event loop iteration.

RETURN VALUE

If the first
event loop iteration has not run yet sd_event_now()
writes current time to usec and returns a positive
return value. Otherwise, it will write the requested
timestamp to usec and return 0. On failure, the call
returns a negative errno-style error code.

Errors

Returned values may indicate the following problems:

-EINVAL

An invalid parameter was
passed.

-EOPNOTSUPP

Unsupported clock type.

-ECHILD

The event loop object was
created in a different process, library or module
instance.

NOTES

Functions
described here are available as a shared library, which can
be compiled against and linked to with the
libsystemd pkg-config(1) file.

The code
described here uses getenv(3), which is declared to
be not multi-thread-safe. This means that the code calling
the functions described here must not call setenv(3)
from a parallel thread. It is recommended to only do calls
to setenv() from an early phase of the program when
no other threads have been started.

HISTORY

sd_event_now()
was added in version 229.
