NAME

pmNameInDomArchive
- translate an instance identifier into an instance name

C SYNOPSIS

#include

int
pmNameInDomArchive(pmInDom indom, int
inst, char **name);

cc ...
-lpcp

DESCRIPTION

Provided that
the current Performance Metrics Application Programming
Interface (PMAPI) context is associated with a set of
archives, pmNameInDomArchive will scan the union of
all the instance domain metadata for the instance domain
indom, locate the first instance with the internal
instance identifier given by inst, and return the
full external instance identification via name.

This routine is
a specialized version of the more general PMAPI routine
pmNameInDom.

The value for
the instance domain indom is typically extracted from
a pmDesc structure, following a call to
pmLookupDesc(3) for a particular performance
metric.

The space for
the value of name will have been allocated in
pmNameInDomArchive with malloc(3), and it is
the responsibility of the caller to free(3) the space
when it is no longer required.

pmNameInDomArchive
returns zero on success.

DIAGNOSTICS

PM_ERR_NOTARCHIVE

the current PMAPI context is
not associated with a set of archives

PM_ERR_INDOM_LOG

indom is not a defined
instance domain identifier for the set of archives

PM_ERR_INST_LOG

the instance identifier
inst is not known for the instance domain
indom in the set of archives
