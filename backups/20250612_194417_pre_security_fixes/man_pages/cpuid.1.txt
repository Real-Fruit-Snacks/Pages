NAME

cpuid - Dump
CPUID information for each CPU

SYNOPSIS

cpuid
[options...]

DESCRIPTION

cpuid
dumps detailed information about the CPU(s) gathered from
the CPUID instruction, and also determines the exact model
of CPU(s) from that information.

It dumps all
information available from the CPUID instruction. The exact
collection of information available varies between
manufacturers and processors. The following information is
available consistently on all modern CPUs:

vendor_id

version information (1/eax)

miscellaneous (1/ebx)

feature information (1/ecx)

It also
produces synthetic fields based on information from multiple
CPUID functions. Currently, the synthetic fields are the
exact model of each CPU (but see LIMITATIONS below) as
(synth); the multiprocessing characteristics including the
number of cores per chip (c) and the number of hyperthreads
per core (t) as (multi-processing synth); and a decoding of
the APIC physical ID as (APIC synth).

The
determination of the model is based on the following
information:

version information (1/eax), processor type

version information (1/eax), family

version information (1/eax), model

version information (1/eax), stepping id

version information (1/eax), extended family

version information (1/eax), extended model

feature information (1/ecx), virtual machine
extensions 

brand id (1/ebx)

brand (0x80000004)

cache and TLB information (2)

deterministic cache parameters (4/eax), extra processor
cores 

AMD extended brand id (0x80000001/ebx)

AMD extended processor signature (0x80000001/eax)

Transmeta processor revision ID (0x80860001/ebx &
ecx) 

The
determination of the multiprocessing characteristics and
decoding of APIC physical ID is based on the following
information:

feature information (1/edx), hyper-threading /
multi-core supported

miscellaneous (1/ebx), cpu count

deterministic cache parameters (4/eax), extra processor
cores on this die

x2APIC features / processor topology (0xb)

AMD feature flags (0x80000001/ecx)

AMD Logical CPU cores (0x80000008/ecx), number of
logical CPU cores - 1

In addition, a
simpler and coarser determination of the CPU is performed
using only the information listed above under version
information (1/eax). It is provided as (simple synth) under
version information (1/eax). However, it tends to be unable
to distinguish between various modern CPUs.

OPTIONS

cpuid
accepts the following command line arguments: 
-1, --one-cpu

Display information only for
the first CPU. This cuts down on the output on a
multiprocessor system, and is useful when certain that all
CPUs are identical.

-f FILE,
--file=FILE

Read raw hex information from
FILE instead of from executions of the cpuid instruction. If
the filename is ’-’, instead read from standard
input.

-l LEAF,
--leaf=LEAF

Display information only for
the specified LEAF.

-s SUBLEAF,
--subleaf=SUBLEAF

Display information only for
the specified SUBLEAF. It requires the -l or --leaf option
to specify the LEAF.

-h, -H, --help

Display help information.

-i, --inst

Use the CPUID instruction. The
information it provides is reliable. It is not necessary to
be root to use this option. (This option is the
default.)

-k, --kernel

Use the CPUID kernel module.
The information does not seem to be reliable on all
combinations of CPU type and kernel version. Typically, it
is necessary to be root to use this option.

-r, --raw

Display only raw hex
information with no decoding.

-v, --version

Display cpuid version.

LIMITATIONS

There are
numerous cases where there is no way to distinguish between
various CPUs in the (synth) information. In some cases, the
sizes of caches, number of cores, brand strings, etc., can
be used to distinguish multiple CPUs with the same family
and model. But there are cases where that information is
insufficient. Whenever cpuid is unable to distinguish
between multiple CPUs, it will list all known
possibilities.

If you believe
that a certain processor should be distinguishable from
another and it isn’t, please inform the author of this
tool.

The
(multi-processing synth) information is unreliable on many
processors. It faithfully reports the information provided
by the CPUID instruction and decodes it as recommended by
the processor manufacturers, but often that information is
incorrect. The information seems to indicate the
architecture’s capabilities, rather than what the
particular chip actually does. In particular, it seems
commonplace to claim the presence of multiple hyperthreads
when there is only one.

kernel can be a source of information on CPUID flags, using
X86_FEATURE_* definitions in
arch/x86/include/asm/cpufeatures.h. Also, it can be used to
learn about Intel microarchitectures in
arch/x86/include/asm/intel-family.h.

Information on
generic hypervisor CPUID leaves is available from this
proposal: http://lwn.net/Articles/301888/>.

Information on
KVM hypervisor CPUID leaves is available from the Linux
kernel under Documentation/virtual/kvm/cpuid.txt.

Information on
XEN hypervisor CPUID leaves is deduced from source
inspection, mainly from xen’s
include/public/arch-x86/cpuid.h and arch/x86/traps.c.

Information on
Microsoft hypervisor CPUID leaves is available from the
following documents from Microsoft:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/reference/tlfs>
and
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff542428%28v=vs.85%29.aspx>.
