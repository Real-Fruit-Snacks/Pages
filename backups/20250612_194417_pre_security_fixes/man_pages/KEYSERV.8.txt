NAME

keyserv — server
for storing private encryption keys

SYNOPSIS

keyserv
[−d] [−D] [−n]
[−p path] [−v]

DESCRIPTION

The keyserv utility is a
daemon that is used for storing the private encryption keys
of each user logged into the system. These encryption keys
are used for accessing secure network services such as
secure NFS.

Normally,
root’s key is read from the file /etc/.rootkey
when the daemon is started. This is useful during power-fail
reboots when no one is around to type a password.

If a client with
no secret key calls keyserv, then the key of user
nobody is used instead as the default key.

The following
options are available:

−d

Disable the use
of default keys for nobody.

−D

Run in
debugging mode and log all requests to keyserv.

−n

Root’s
secret key is not read from /etc/.rootkey. Instead,
keyserv prompts the user for the password to decrypt
root’s key stored in the /etc/publickey
database and then stores the decrypted key in
/etc/.rootkey for future use. This option is useful
if the /etc/.rootkey file ever gets out of date or
corrupted.

−p path

Specify where to search for
libdes.so.3. Default is /usr/lib.

−v

Display status
of DES support (enabled/disabled).

FILES 
/etc/.rootkey 
/usr/lib/libdes.so.3
