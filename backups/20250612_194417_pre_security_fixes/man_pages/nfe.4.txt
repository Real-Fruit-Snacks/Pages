NFE(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual NFE(4)

NAME

nfe — NVIDIA nForce
MCP Ethernet driver

SYNOPSIS

To compile this driver into the
kernel, place the following lines in your kernel
configuration file:

device
miibus 
device nfe

Alternatively,
to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following line in loader.conf(5):

if_nfe_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION

The nfe driver supports
PCI Ethernet adapters based on the NVIDIA nForce Media and
Communications Processors (MCP), such as the nForce, nForce
2, nForce 3, CK804, MCP04, MCP51, MCP55, MCP61, MCP65,
MCP67, MCP73, MCP77 and MCP79 Ethernet controller chips.

Supported
features include (hardware support provided):

•

Receive/Transmit IP/TCP/UDP
checksum offload

•

Hardware VLAN tag
insertion/stripping

•

TCP segmentation offload
(TSO)

•

MSI/MSI-X

•

Jumbo Frames

Support for
Jumbo Frames is provided via the interface MTU setting.
Selecting an MTU larger than 1500 bytes with the ifconfig(8)
utility configures the adapter to receive and transmit Jumbo
Frames.

The nfe
driver supports the following media types:

autoselect

Enable
autoselection of the media type and options.

10baseT/UTP

Set 10Mbps
operation.

100baseTX

Set 100Mbps
(Fast Ethernet) operation.

1000baseT

Set 1000Mbps
(Gigabit Ethernet) operation (recent models only).

The nfe
driver supports the following media options:

half-duplex

Force half
duplex operation.

full-duplex

Force full
duplex operation.

For more
information on configuring this device, see ifconfig(8).

LOADER TUNABLES

Tunables can be set at the
loader(8) prompt before booting the kernel or stored in
loader.conf(5).

hw.nfe.msi_disable

Whether or not MSI support is
enabled in the driver. The default value is 0.

hw.nfe.msix_disable

Whether or not MSI-X support is
enabled in the driver. The default value is 0.

SYSCTL VARIABLES

The following sysctl(8)
variables can be used to modify or monitor nfe
behavior.

dev.nfe.%d.process_limit

Maximum number of Rx events to
be processed in the event loop before rescheduling a
taskqueue. The accepted range is 50 to 255, the default
value is 192. The interface does not need to be brought down
and up again before a change takes effect.
