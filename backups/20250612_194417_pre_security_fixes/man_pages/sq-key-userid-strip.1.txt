NAME

sq key userid
strip - Strip a User ID

SYNOPSIS

sq key
userid strip [OPTIONS] FILE

DESCRIPTION

Strip a User
ID.

Note that this
operation does not reliably remove User IDs from a
certificate that has already been disseminated! (OpenPGP
software typically appends new information it receives about
a certificate to its local copy of that certificate. Systems
that have obtained a copy of your certificate with the User
ID that you are trying to strip will not drop that User ID
from their copy.)

In most cases,
you will want to use the ’sq key userid revoke’
operation instead. That issues a revocation for a User ID,
which can be used to mark the User ID as invalidated.

However, this
operation can be useful in very specific cases, in
particular: to remove a mistakenly added User ID before it
has been uploaded to key servers or otherwise shared.

Stripping a
User ID may change how a certificate is interpreted. This is
because information about the certificate like algorithm
preferences, the primary key’s key flags, etc. is
stored in the User ID’s binding signature.
