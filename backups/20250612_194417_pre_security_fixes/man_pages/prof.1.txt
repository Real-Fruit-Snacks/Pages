SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION

Secondary
structure is predicted by a system of neural networks rating
at an expected average accuracy > 72% for the three
states helix, strand and loop (Rost & Sander,
PNAS, 1993 , 90, 7558−7562 ; Rost &
Sander, JMB, 1993 , 232, 584−599 ; and
Rost & Sander, Proteins, 1994 , 19, 55−72;
evaluation of accuracy). Evaluated on the same data set,
PROFsec is rated at ten percentage points higher three-state
accuracy than methods using only single sequence
information, and at more than six percentage points higher
than, e.g., a method using alignment information based on
statistics (Levin, Pascarella, Argos & Garnier, Prot.
Engng., 6, 849−54, 1993). PHDsec predictions have
three main features: 
1. improved accuracy through evolutionary information from
multiple 
sequence alignments 
2. improved beta-strand prediction through a balanced
training 
procedure 
3. more accurate prediction of secondary structure segments
by using a 
multi-level system

Solvent
accessibility is predicted by a neural network method rating
at a correlation coefficient (correlation between
experimentally observed and predicted relative solvent
accessibility) of 0.54 cross-validated on a set of 238
globular proteins (Rost & Sander, Proteins, 1994, 20,
216−226; evaluation of accuracy). The output of the
neural network codes for 10 states of relative
accessibility. Expressed in units of the difference between
prediction by homology modelling (best method) and
prediction at random (worst method), PROFacc is some 26
percentage points superior to a comparable neural network
using three output states (buried, intermediate, exposed)
and using no information from multiple alignments.

Transmembrane
helices in integral membrane proteins are predicted by a
system of neural networks. The shortcoming of the network
system is that often too long helices are predicted. These
are cut by an empirical filter. The final prediction (Rost
et al., Protein Science, 1995, 4, 521−533; evaluation
of accuracy) has an expected per-residue accuracy of about
95%. The number of false positives, i.e., transmembrane
helices predicted in globular proteins, is about 2%. The
neural network prediction of transmembrane helices (PHDhtm)
is refined by a dynamic programming-like algorithm. This
method resulted in correct predictions of all transmembrane
helices for 89% of the 131 proteins used in a
cross-validation test; more than 98% of the transmembrane
helices were correctly predicted. The output of this method
is used to predict topology, i.e., the orientation of the
N−term with respect to the membrane. The expected
accuracy of the topology prediction is > 86%. Prediction
accuracy is higher than average for eukaryotic proteins and
lower than average for prokaryotes. PHDtopology is more
accurate than all other methods tested on identical data
sets.

If no output
file option (such as −−fileRdb or
−−fileOut) is given the
RDB formatted output is written into
./INPUTFILENAME.prof where ’prof’
replaces the extension of the input file. In lack of
extension ’.prof’ is appended to the input file
name.

Output
format 
The RDB format is self-annotating, see
example outputs in /share/profphd/prof/exa.

BUGS

Please report
bugs at
https://rostlab.org/bugzilla3/enter_bug.cgi?product=profphd>.

Prediction from HSSP file fails when residue
lines with exclamation 
marks ’!’ are present:

Use
’optJury=normal’ and ’both’ like
this:

 prof /tmp/1a3q.hssp fileRdb=/tmp/1a3q.hssp.profRdb optJury=normal both
