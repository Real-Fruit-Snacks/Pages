NAME

wcsstr - locate
a substring in a wide-character string

SYNOPSIS

#include

wchar_t
*wcsstr(const wchar_t *haystack, const wchar_t
*needle);

DESCRIPTION

The
wcsstr() function is the wide-character equivalent of
the strstr(3) function. It searches for the first
occurrence of the wide-character string needle
(without its terminating null wide character (L'\0')) as a
substring in the wide-character string haystack.

RETURN VALUE

The
wcsstr() function returns a pointer to the first
occurrence of needle in haystack. It returns
NULL if needle does not occur as a substring in
haystack.

Note the
special case: If needle is the empty wide-character
string, the return value is always haystack
itself.
