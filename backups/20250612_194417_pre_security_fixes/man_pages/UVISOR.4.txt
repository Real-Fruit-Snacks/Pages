UVISOR(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual UVISOR(4)

NAME

uvisor — USB
support for the PalmOS based PDAs

SYNOPSIS

To compile this driver into the
kernel, place the following lines in your kernel
configuration file:

device usb

device ucom 
device uvisor

Alternatively,
to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following line in loader.conf(5):

uvisor_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION

The uvisor driver
provides support for USB based PalmOS PDAs, like Handspring
Visor, Palm Mxxx series, and Sony Clie.

The device is
accessed through the ucom(4) driver which makes it behave
like a tty(4). The device has several ports for different
purposes, each of them gets its own ucom(4) device. The
attach message describes the purpose of each port.

The usual Pilot
tools can be used to access the attached device on the
HotSync port.

HISTORY

The uvisor driver was
adopted from NetBSD 1.5 in August 2002. This manual
page was adopted from NetBSD by Tom Rhodes
trhodes [AT] FreeBSD.org> at that time.

BUGS

The code to provide multiple
ucom(4) instances has not yet been ported from NetBSD. It is
unclear whether this driver works in its current state.
