NAME

corosync-cmapctl:
- A tool for accessing the object database.

DESCRIPTION

usage:
corosync-cmapctl [-b] [-DdghsTt] [-m map] [-p filename]
[params...]

-b show binary values

-m select map to use

The default map
is ’icmap’ which contains configuration
information and some runtime variables used by corosync. A
’stats’ map is also available which displays
network statistics - in great detail when knet is used as
the transport. Tracking of individual keys (but not
prefixes) works on the stats map but notifications are sent
on a timer, and not every time a value changes.

Set key:

corosync-cmapctl -s
key_name type value

where type is
one of ([i|u][8|16|32|64] | flt | dbl | str | bin) for bin,
value is file name (or - for stdin)

Load
settings from a file:

corosync-cmapctl -p
filename

the format of
the file is: [^[^]][ 
]

Keys prefixed
with single caret (’^’) are deleted (see
-d).

Keys (actually
prefixes) prefixed with double caret (’^^’) are
deleted by prefix (see -D).

and  are optional (not checked) in above
cases.

Other keys are
set (see -s) so both  and 
are required.

Delete
key:

corosync-cmapctl -d
key_name...

Delete
multiple keys with prefix:

corosync-cmapctl -D
key_prefix...

Get
key:

corosync-cmapctl [-b] -g
key_name...

Quiet
output:

corosync-cmapctl [-b] -q
-g key_name...

Display all
keys:

corosync-cmapctl [-b]

Display keys
with prefix key_name:

corosync-cmapctl [-b]
key_name...

Track
changes on keys with key_name:

corosync-cmapctl [-b] -t
key_name

Track
changes on keys with key prefix:

corosync-cmapctl [-b] -T
key_prefix

Clear
statistics (-mstats is implied)

corosync-cmapctl -C
[ipc|totem|knet|all]
