DESCRIPTION

olsrd is
an implementation of the Optimized Link State Routing
protocol for Mobile Ad-Hoc networks(MANET). The protocol is
described in RFC3626. It is designed to be run as a
standalone server process - but as it is still in an
experimental stage most users will prefer running it with
some debug output which is directed to STDOUT.

This manual
page only lists the command line arguments. For details of
the configuration file see the comments included in
/etc/olsrd.conf. Note that none of these options need
to be set at the command line - all these options and others
can be set in the configuration file.

This
implementation also features an alternative routing scheme
based on link quality using an ETX-like metric developed by
the c-base community in Berlin. To enable and tweak this
mode you must use the configuration file.

The homepage of
olsrd is http://www.olsr.org

OPTIONS

-i
interface1 ... interfaceN

This option specifies on what
network interfaces olsrd should run. These interfaces cannot
be aliased interfaces such as eth0:1.

-f configfile

This option overrides the
default configuration file path used by olsrd -
/etc/olsrd.conf

-d debuglevel

This option specifies the
amount of debug information olsrd should write to STDOUT. If
set to 0 olsrd will run in the background.

-ipv6

This option instructs olsrd to use the Internet Protocol
version 6. The default is version 4.

-ipc

This option allows the GUI front-end created fro olsrd
to connect to olsrd at runtime.

-dispin

This option, when set, causes olsrd to display all
incoming packet data on STDOUT. When using IPv4 the data is
displayed in decimal format, when using IPv6 the data is
displayed in hexadecimal format.

-dispout

This option, when set, causes olsrd to display all
outgoing packet data on STDOUT. When using IPv4 the data is
displayed in decimal format, when using IPv6 the data is
displayed in hexadecimal format.

-nofork

This option, when set, causes olsrd not to fork and run
in the background if started with debuglevel 0. Useful for
init scripts.

-delgw

If this option is set olsrd will remove any default
routes set prior to adding an Internet route based on OLSR
routing. 

-bcast
broadcastaddress

This option specifies what IPv4
broadcastaddress to use for OLSR control traffic. The only
value that currently makes sense when setting broadcast
address mannually is 255.255.255.255. The default
action is to use the broadcastaddres that the network
interface is preconfigured with(per interface).

-hint seconds

This value sets the interval on
which HELLO messages should be generated. The value
is a floating point number representing seconds.

-tcint
seconds

This value sets the interval on
which TC messages should be generated. The value is a
floating point number representing seconds.

-midint
seconds

This value sets the interval on
which MID messages should be generated. The value is
a floating point number representing seconds.

-hnaint
seconds

This value sets the interval on
which HNA messages should be generated. The value is
a floating point number representing seconds.

-T seconds

This option sets the polling intervall of the scheduler.
The default is 0.1 seconds. This option should only be
considered if running with really low emission
intervals. 

-hemu IP
address

Use this option to connect to
the olsr_switch network simulation application. Here IP
address will be the IP address that the process will set as
its main address in the emulation mode. This address has no
connection to the real IP-stack and can be chosen
freely.
