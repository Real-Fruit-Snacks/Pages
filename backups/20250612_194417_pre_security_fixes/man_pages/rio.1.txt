NAME

rio - program
to control a Diamond RIO MP3 player

SYNOPSIS

rio
[options] files ...

DESCRIPTION

This manual
page documents briefly the rio command. This manual
page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution
because the original program does not have a manual
page.

rio is a
CLI controller for a Diamond Rio MP3 file player.

The default
ioport is 0x378. If this is not the ioport for your printer
port, you will have to use the -p option.

INITIALIZATION

Initialization
should only be performed on new or corrupt cards. You can
initialize with bad block checking enabled (-iy) which will
test all blocks on the internal or external flash ram (which
ever is selected) and note all bad blocks. This process will
take some time (upto 20 minutes on slow machines). You can
also initialize with bad block checking disabled (-in) which
is much quicker but all blocks (even bad blocks) will be
used.

If you want to
delete all files on the device, the (-za) option should be
used instead of using the initialization options mentioned
above.
