NAME

axparms -
Configure AX.25 interfaces.

SYNOPSIS

axparms
--assoc|--forward|--route|--setcall|--version ...

DESCRIPTION

The
axparms command is designed to be a multi-function
command that allows miscellaneous commands to be issued to
the Linux AX.25 protocol layer. The different modes of the
command are chosen by the first argument. Subsequent
arguments depend upon this argument and so no generalised
command format can be given.

--assoc Argument

The format of
this option is:

axparms
--assoc   
axparms --assoc  delete 
axparms --assoc policy [default|deny] 
axparms --assoc show

This option
manipulates the kernel uid/callsign mapping table, allowing
callsigns to be associated and dis-associated with a user.
The policy option permits the superuser to have all
other uid’s either default to the actual port name, or
to block traffic.

At power up the
table is blank and the policy is ’default’,
which is thus backward compatible.

--forward Argument

Allows the use
of many receivers with one transmitter, known as packet
forwarding in many systems. The format of this command
is:

axparms
--forward   
axparms --forward  delete

Any packets to
be transmitted on port portfrom will be transmitted on port
portto. This will stay in force until the second form of the
command is issued which will remove the association.

--route Argument

This option
allows the internal AX.25 routing table to be manipulated.
This table is available for reading in /proc/net/ax25_route,
and will be built up dynamically by stations heard. However
it is possible to add, delete and list entries via this
option.

The formats of
this option are:

axparms
--route add   []
[--ipmode V|D] 
axparms --route del   
axparms --route list

Routes added
via this command will not be removed from the internal
routing table when they are “old” as normal
entries are. The --ipmode option sets mode vc or mode
datagram for this destination.

If the
 argument is set to “default”
then this will set the default route for all outgoing AX.25
connections which will be used when there is no specific
route to the required destination.

--setcall Argument

The format of
this option is:

axparms
--setcall  

This changes
the callsign associated at the given physical ax25
interface.

Cave: The
interface name is not the symbolic port name from axports,
but the real interface name (from ifconfig(8)): ax0, ax1,
.., sp0, .., bpq0, ... etc..

The change is
permanent as long as the interface exists, or another
“axparms --setcall” is issued.

The interface
has to exist already in order to use this option; it may be
in state UP or DOWN.

--version Argument

This option
displays the version of the AX.25 utilities that
axparms belongs to.
