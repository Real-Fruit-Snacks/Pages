NAME

go-version -
print the build information for Go executables

SYNOPSIS

go
version [-m] [-v] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION

Go version
reports the Go version used to build each of the named
executable files.

If no files are
named on the command line, go version prints its own version
information.

If a directory
is named, go version walks that directory, recursively,
looking for recognized Go binaries and reporting their
versions. By default, go version does not report
unrecognized files found during a directory scan. The -v
flag causes it to report unrecognized files.

The -m flag
causes go version to print each executable’s embedded
module version information, when available. In the output,
the module information consists of multiple lines following
the version line, each indented by a leading tab
character.
