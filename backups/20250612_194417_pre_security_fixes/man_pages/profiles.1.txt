DESCRIPTION

This tool is
part of the samba(7) suite.

profiles is a
utility that reports and changes SIDs in windows registry
files. It currently only supports NT.

OPTIONS

file

Registry file to view or
edit.

-v,--verbose

Increases verbosity of
messages.

-c SID1 -n
SID2, --change-sid SID1 --new-sid SID2

Change all occurrences of SID1
in file by SID2.

-d|--debuglevel=DEBUGLEVEL

level is an integer from
0 to 10. The default value if this parameter is not
specified is 1 for client applications.

The higher this
value, the more detail will be logged to the log files about
the activities of the server. At level 0, only critical
errors and serious warnings will be logged. Level 1 is a
reasonable level for day-to-day running - it generates a
small amount of information about operations carried
out.

Levels above 1
will generate considerable amounts of log data, and should
only be used when investigating a problem. Levels above 3
are designed for use only by developers and generate HUGE
amounts of log data, most of which is extremely cryptic.

Note that
specifying this parameter here will override the
log level
parameter in the /etc/samba/smb.conf
file.

--debug-stdout

This will
redirect debug output to STDOUT. By default all clients are
logging to STDERR.

--configfile=

The file
specified contains the configuration details required by the
client. The information in this file can be general for
client and server or only provide client specific like
options such as client smb
encrypt. See
/etc/samba/smb.conf for more information. The default
configuration file name is determined at compile
time.

--option==

Set the
smb.conf(5) option "" to value
"" from the command line. This
overrides compiled-in defaults and options read from the
configuration file. If a name or a value includes a space,
wrap whole --option=name=value into quotes.

-l|--log-basename=logdirectory

Base
directory name for log/debug files. The extension
".progname" will be appended (e.g.
log.smbclient, log.smbd, etc...). The log file is never
removed by the client.

--leak-report

Enable
talloc leak reporting on exit.

--leak-report-full

Enable
full talloc leak reporting on exit.

-V|--version

Prints
the program version number.

-?|--help

Print a
summary of command line options.

--usage

Display
brief usage message.
