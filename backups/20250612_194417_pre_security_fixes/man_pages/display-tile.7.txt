NAME

display-tile
: Divide display into tiles similar to a video wall

SYNOPSIS

display-tile :
[ [-usedb] | [-nodb] ] 

,,,,

...

DESCRIPTION

Emulates one
big target, where one or more areas are mapped to different
child visuals.

OPTIONS

For each tile
(i.e. child visual or mapped area), the following must be
specified: 
offset-x, offset-y

coordinates (within the parent
visual) of the top-left corner of the child visual

size-x,
size-y

width and height of the child
visual

:p’child-target-spec’

a target spec. Since target
specs can (and often do) contain colons, it needs to be
enclosed in parentheses.

The following
options apply to the whole display-tile:

-usedb

Enables DirectBuffer emulation. This is the default
mode. 

The contents of
each mapped area is blitted from the DirectBuffer into their
respective child visuals at regular intervals or when the
visual is flushed. DirectBuffer emulation works regardless
of whether the child visuals support DirectBuffer or
not.

-nodb

Disables DirectBuffer emulation.
LibGGI primitives are passed to each of the child visuals
with the necessary clipping and translation. Thus, if a
child visual underlying a mapped area supports acceleration,
then the operation on that area will be accelerated.

FEATURES

•

DirectBuffer support depends on
the -usedb and -nodb options.

•

Accelerated in no-DB mode if the underlying target is,
otherwise unaccelerated.

Tip:
display-tile can be used to emulate DirectBuffer for
obstinate applications that cannot run without it, by
specifying one tile which maps the whole screen.
