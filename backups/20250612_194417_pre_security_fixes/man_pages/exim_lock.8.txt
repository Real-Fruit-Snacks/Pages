exim_lock -
Mailbox maintenance

SYNOPSIS

exim_lock
[options]mailbox-file

DESCRIPTION

The
exim_lock utility locks a mailbox file using the same
algorithm as Exim. For a discussion of locking issues, see
section "appendfile transport", subsection
"Operational details for appending" the Exim
specification. exim_lock can be used to prevent any
modification of a mailbox by Exim or a user agent while
investigating a problem. The utility requires the name of
the file as its first argument. If the locking is
successful, the second argument is run as a command (using
C’s “system()” function); if there is no
second argument, the value of the SHELL environment variable
is used; if this is unset or empty, /bin/sh is run. When the
command finishes, the mailbox is unlocked and the utility
ends. The following options are available:

-fcntl

Use “fcntl()” locking on the open
mailbox. 

-flock

Use “flock()” locking on the open mailbox,
provided the operating system supports it.

-interval

This must be followed by a
number, which is a number of seconds; it sets the interval
to sleep between retries (default 3).

-lockfile

Create a lock file before
opening the mailbox.

-mbx

Lock the mailbox using MBX rules.

-q

Suppress verification output.

-retries

This must be followed by a
number; it sets the number of times to try to get the lock
(default 10).

-restore_time

This option causes exim_lock to
restore the modified and read times to the locked file
before exiting. This allows you to access a locked mailbox
(for example, to take a backup copy) without disturbing the
times that the user subsequently sees.

-timeout

This must be followed by a
number, which is a number of seconds; it sets a timeout to
be used with a blocking “fcntl()” lock. If it is
not set (the default), a non-blocking call is used.

-v

Generate verbose output.

If none of
-fcntl, -flock, -lockfile or -mbx are given,
the default is to create a lock file and also use
“fcntl()” locking on the mailbox, which is the
same as Exim’s default. The use of
-fcntl or -flock requires that the file be
writable; the use of -lockfile requires that the
directory containing the file be writable. Locking by lock
file does not last for ever; Exim assumes that a lock file
is expired if it is more than 30 minutes old.

The -mbx
can be used with either or both of -fcntl or
-flock. It assumes -fcntl by default. MBX
locking causes a shared lock to be taken out on the open
mailbox, and an exclusive lock on the file /tmp/.n.m where n
and m are the device number and inode number of the mailbox
file. When the locking is released, if an exclusive lock can
be obtained for the mailbox, the file in /tmp is
deleted.

The default
output contains verification of the locking that takes
place. The -v option causes some additional
information to be given. The -q option suppresses all
output except error messages.

A command such
as

exim_lock
/var/spool/mail/spqr

runs an
interactive shell while the file is locked, whereas

exim_lock -q
/var/spool/mail/spqr 

End

runs a specific
non-interactive sequence of commands while the file is
locked, suppressing all verification output. A single
command can be run by a command such as

exim_lock -q
/var/spool/mail/spqr "cp /var/spool/mail/spqr
/some/where"

Note that if a
command is supplied, it must be entirely contained within
the second argument - hence the quotes.

This manual

than us and has more experience in writing manual pages, any
patches would be greatly appreciated.
