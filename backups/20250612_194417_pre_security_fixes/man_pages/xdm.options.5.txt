NAME

xdm.options -
configuration options for the X display manager

DESCRIPTION

/etc/X11/xdm/xdm.options
contains a set of flags that determine some of the behavior
of the X display manager xdm(1x). Most of
xdm’s behavior is customized through other
files; consult the xdm manual page if this manual
page does not describe the behavior you want to alter.

/etc/X11/xdm/xdm.options
may contain comments, which begin with a hash mark
(’#’) and end at the next newline, just like
comments in shell scripts. The rest of the file consists of
options which are expressed as words separated by hyphens,
with only one option per line. Options are enabled by simply
placing them in the file; they are disabled by prefixing the
option name with ’no-’.

Available
options are: 
ignore-nologin

Normally, if the
nologin(5) file exists, its contents will be
displayed using xmessage(1x) (if xmessage is
available), and the user will be returned to the xdm
login screen after xmessage is dismissed instead of starting
the X session. If this option is enabled, xdm starts
a session as usual (after xmessage is dismissed, if
xmessage is available and the nologin file
exists). This behavior is disabled by default:
nologin is heeded, not ignored.

restart-on-upgrade

Enable this option with
caution on ’production’ machines; it causes
the daemon to be stopped and restarted on upgrade, even if
the process has children (which means it is managing X
sessions). Typically when a package that contains a daemon
is being installed or upgraded, its maintainer scripts stop
a running daemon process before installing the new binary,
and restart it after the new binary is installed. Stopping
xdm causes immediate termination of any sessions it
manages; in some situations this could be an unwelcome
surprise (for instance, for remote xdm users who had
no idea the administrator was performing system
maintenance). On the other hand, for machines that stay up
for long periods of time, leaving the old daemon running can
be a bad idea if the new version has, for instance, a fix
for a security vulnerability (overwriting xdm’s
executable on the file system has no effect on the copy of
xdm in memory). The xdm package’s
pre-removal script checks to see if the xdm process
has any children; if it does, it is possible that
someone’s session would be killed by stopping
xdm, so a warning is issued and an opportunity to
abort the upgrade of xdm is provided. Furthermore,
restarting xdm on upgrade can be surprising, because
a locally-managed X server can change the active VT even
while other packages are continuing to upgrade. If, by
intent or accident, the X server does not honor the key
sequence to switch VTs back to a virtual console, this can
be undesirable. This behavior is disabled by default:
xdm will be not be stopped or started during an
upgrade of its package; the administrator will have to do so
by hand (with invoke-rc.d xdm restart or by rebooting
the system) before the newly installed xdm binary is
used.

start-on-install

Enable this option with
caution; it causes the xdm daemon to be started
immediately after the package is installed. See the above
entry regarding restart-on-upgrade for other caveats
regarding the consequences of starting the xdm daemon
during package management. This behavior is disabled by
default: xdm will not be started when it is
installed. Changing this setting can affect future installs
if the package is removed, but not purged (which removes
’conffiles’, including xdm.options).

use-sessreg

This option causes the
/etc/X11/xdm/Xreset script to call the
sessreg(1x) program to register X sessions managed by
xdm in the utmp(5) and wtmp(5) files.
If it is disabled, the utmp and wtmp files
will have no record of xdm sessions. This behavior is
enabled by default; sessreg will be used.

Users of older
versions of the Debian system should note that the
’run-xconsole’ option has been removed. The
shell script named /etc/X11/xdm/Xreset can be edited
to disable or modify the running of xconsole on the
xdm greeter screen; see xdm(1x) for more
information.

AUTHORS

Stephen Early,
Mark Eichin, and Branden Robinson customized
xdm’s startup and reset scripts and package
maintainer scripts to implement the functionality described
above. This manual page was written by Branden Robinson.
