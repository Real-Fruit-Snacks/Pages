NAME

pmCtime
- format the date and time for a reporting timezone

C SYNOPSIS

#include

#include 

char
*pmCtime(const time_t *clock, char
*buf);

cc ...
-lpcp

DESCRIPTION

pmCtime
is very similar to ctime(3), except the timezone used
is the current ’’reporting
timezone’’ (rather than the default TZ
environment variable scheme), and the result is returned
into a caller-declared buffer (rather than a private
buffer).

Like
ctime(3) the time to be converted is passed via
clock, and the result in buf is fixed width
fields in the format:

Fri Sep 13
00:00:00 1986\n\0

The result
buffer buf must be at least 26 bytes long, and no
attempt is made to check this. pmCtime returns
buf as the value of the function.

The default
current reporting timezone is as defined by the TZ
environment variable, so pmCtime and ctime(3)
will initially produce similar encoding of the date and
time.

Use
pmNewZone(3), pmNewContextZone(3) or
pmUseZone(3) to establish a new current reporting
timezone that will effect pmCtime but not
ctime(3).
