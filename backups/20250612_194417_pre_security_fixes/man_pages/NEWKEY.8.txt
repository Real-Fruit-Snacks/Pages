NEWKEY(8)

NAME

newkey — create a
new key in the publickey database

SYNOPSIS

newkey −h
hostname 
newkey −u username

DESCRIPTION

The newkey utility is
normally run by the network administrator on the Network
Interface Service ( NIS ) master machine in
order to establish public keys for users and super-users on
the network. These keys are needed for using secure RPC or
secure NFS .

The
newkey utility will prompt for the login password of
the given username and then create a new public/secret key
pair in /etc/publickey encrypted with the login
password of the given user.

Use of
this program is not required: users may create their own
keys using chkey(1).
