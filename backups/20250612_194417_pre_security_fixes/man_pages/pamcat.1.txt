Minimum unique
abbreviation of option is acceptable. You may use double
hyphens instead of single hyphen to denote options. You may
use white space in place of the equals sign to separate an
option name from its value.

DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

pamcat
reads one or more Netpbm images as input, concatenates them
either left to right or top to bottom, and produces a single
Netpbm image as output.

Options
-leftright and -topbottom determine the
direction 
of the concatenation.

The images do
not have to be the same shape: You can concatenate images

of different widths top to bottom and of different heights
left to right. 
You can concatenate images of different depths (numbers of
planes). You 
can concatenate a PBM image with a PPM image. Et cetera.

The format of
the output image is the highest of the formats of the 
input images, in the order PBM, PGM, PPM, PAM.

For PAM output,
if all of the input images have the same tuple type 
(including implied tuple types of PNM images), that is the
tuple type of the 
output. If the inputs differ, but are all visual tuple
types, the 
output’s tuple type is the most primitive that can
represent all the 
input. E.g. if inputs are GRAYSCALE and RGB, the output is
RGB, and if the 
inputs are GRAYSCALE_ALPHA and RGB, the output is RGB_ALPHA.
If the inputs 
differ and are not all visual, the output tuple type is a
null string.

When the output
is PAM, its depth is the maximum of the depths of the 
inputs (including implied depths of PNM images), but at
least enough to 
represent the tuple type specified above. In the case of
nonvisual PAM 
output, input images are padded to this output depth with
higher numbered 
planes of all zeroes.

Where the input
images are of different widths and you concatenate top 
to bottom, pamcat generates output as wide as the
widest of the 
inputs and pads the narrower ones. The images can be
justified either 
left, right, or center within this padded field. Use options

-jleft, -jright, and -jcenter to control
this.

Similarly,
where the input images are of different heights and you 
concatenate left to right, pamcat generates output as
tall as the 
tallest of the inputs and pads the shorter ones. The images
can be 
justified either top, bottom, or center within this padded
field. Use 
options 
-jtop, -jbottom, and -jcenter to control
this.

You can make
the padding black or white or let pamcat determine a

likely background color, with possibly different colored
padding for each 
input image. Control this with the -black and
-white options.

Where the
output image contains transparency information (because at
least 
one of the input images does), the padding is opaque. (That
is consistent 
with the result for an output image without transparency
information, because 
such an image is defined to be opaque).

The arguments
are names of input files. Any one of these, but not more
than one, may be "-" to indicate Standard Input.
If you have no arguments (and do not specify
-listfile), that means a single input image from
Standard Input (and that is pointless - the output is the
same as the input). You can supply the file names in a file
instead of as arguments with a -listfile option.

Regardless of
how you specify the input files, you may not concatenate

more files than your system’s limit on the number of
concurrently 
open files by one process. 16 is a typical number for
that.

To assemble a
regular grid of images, you can use pamundice.

To do the
reverse, you might use pamdice to split an image up
into smaller ones of equal size or pamcut to chop off
part of an image or extract part of an image.

pnmtile
concatenates a single input image to itself repeatedly.

OPTIONS

In addition to
the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most
notably -quiet, see
 Common Options ),
pamcat recognizes the following command line
options:

Direction

-topbottom, -tb

Combine images vertically, top
to bottom.

-leftright,
-lr

Combine images horizontally,
left to right.

You must
specify the direction by specifying one of the above. You
cannot 
specify both.

Justification

-jleft

Left-justify images in a top-bottom concatenation.

You cannot
specify this with -jright

This option is
invalid in a left-right concatenation.

-jright

Right-justify
images in a top-bottom concatenation.

You cannot
specify this with -jleft

This option is
invalid in a left-right concatenation.

-jtop

Top-justify images in a left-right concatenation.

You cannot
specify this with -jbottom

This option is
invalid in a top-bottom concatenation.

-jbottom

Bottom-justify
images in a left-right concatenation.

You cannot
specify this with -jtop

This option is
invalid in a top-bottom concatenation.

-jcenter

Center images
(valid for both left-right and top-bottom concatenations).

This is the default.

By default,
pamcat centers the smaller images. 
-topbottom -jleft would stack the images on top of each
other, flush 
with the left edge. -leftright -jbottom would line up
the images 
left to right with their bottom edges aligned as if sitting
on a table.

Padding
Color 
These options specify what color to use to fill in the extra
space when doing the justification. If neither is specified,
pamcat chooses whichever color seems to be right for
the images, and the color may be different for each
image.

-white

Make all padding white.

You may not
specify this with -black

-black

Make all padding black.

You may not
specify this with -white

Miscellaneous

-listfile={filename|-}

This specifies the name of a
file that contains the list of input files. 
Option value - means the list comes from Standard
Input.

The file
contains one file name per newline-delimited line in
whatever 
code the system fopen service expects. You may omit
the newline 
on the last line. Empty lines are ignored. There is no
mechanism for 
including comments in the list (so if you want to have a
commented list, 
preprocess it to remove comments before supplying it to
pamcat).

You may not
specify file names as command line arguments together with

-listfile

You may not
list more files than than your system’s limit on the

number of concurrently open files by one process. 16 is a
typical number 
for that.

This option was
new in Netpbm 11.01 (December 2022).

HISTORY

pamcat
was new in Netpbm 11.00 (September 2022); in earlier
versions, 
pnmcat does most of the same thing.

Primordial
Netpbm/Pbmplus contained concatenation tools, but there were
two 
of them: pbmcatlr for left-right concatenation of PBM
images 
and pbmcattb for top-bottom concatenation. When the
PGM and PPM 
formats were added, these programs were combined and
extended to handle all 
three formats, as pnmcat. All of this work was done
by Pbmplus 
author Jef Poskanzer.

In Netpbm 10.44
(September 2008), Akira F Urushibata added special fast 
processing for raw PBM images, exploiting bitstring
processing CPU 
facilities.

pnmcat
was one of the most essential programs in Netpbm, but one

thing it could not concatenate was PAM images with
transparency. So in 
Netpbm 11.00 (September 2022), Bryan Henderson wrote
pamcat to 
replace it. It reused the raw PBM fast path code from
pnmcat almost 
verbatim.
