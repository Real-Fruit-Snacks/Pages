corosync-qdevice-net-certutil
- tool to generate qdevice model net TLS certificates

SYNOPSIS

corosync-qdevice-net-certutil
[-i|-m|-M|-r|-s|-Q] [-c certificate] [-n
cluster_name]

DESCRIPTION

corosync-qdevice-net-certutil
is a frontend for NSS certutil used for generating client
certificate for the net model of qdevice.

OPTIONS

-i

Initialize the QDevice Net NSS
certificate database. The default directory for the database
is /etc/corosync/qdevice/net/. This directory has to be
writable by the current user. It needs the QNetd CA
certificate passed as the -c parameter. This
certificate can be found on the server running QNetd in the
file /etc/corosync/qnetd/nssdb/qnetd-cacert.crt.

-m

Import the cluster certificate and key from a pk12
file. 

-r

Generate a certificate request. The certificate request
is exported into
/etc/corosync/qdevice/net/qdevice-net-node.crq. It is
necessary to pass the cluster name using the -n
parameter. The cluster name has to match the one defined in
/etc/corosync/corosync.conf. 

-M

Import a signed certificate and export a certificate
with private key into pk12 file.

-Q

Use ssh/scp to properly set both corosync-qnetd
and corosync-qdevice certificates on all nodes.
Itâ€™s highly recommended that you use an ssh agent, or
ssh/scp will keep asking for a password - roughly 8 times
the number of nodes.

-c

File with certificate to load.

-n

Name of the cluster.
