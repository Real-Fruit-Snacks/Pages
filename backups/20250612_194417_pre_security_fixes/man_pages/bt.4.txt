Tagged queueing
is supported on ’W’ series adapters,
’C’ series adapters with firmware of rev 4.42
and higher, and ’S’ series adapters with
firmware of rev 3.35 and higher.

Boards with
certain firmware revisions may lock up under heavy load to
certain devices, especially if tagged queueing is used.
Should you encounter a problem with your adapter, contact
Mylex technical support and ensure you have the latest
firmware for your controller.

HISTORY

The bt driver first
appeared in the 386BSD patch kit.

AUTHORS

Julian Elischer wrote a driver
for the Multimaster cards that appeared in the 386BSD patch
kit. The driver was rewritten by Justin T. Gibbs to take
advantage of new board features and work with the CAM SCSI
framework in FreeBSD 3.0.

Special thanks
to Leonard N. Zubkoff for writing such a complete and well
documented Mylex/BusLogic MultiMaster driver for Linux.
Support in this driver for the wide range of MultiMaster
controllers and firmware revisions, with their otherwise
undocumented quirks, would not have been possible without
his efforts.
