NAME
       Text::LevenshteinXS - An XS implementation of the Levenshtein edit
       distance

SYNOPSIS
        use Text::LevenshteinXS qw(distance);

        print distance("foo","four");
        # prints "2"

        print distance("foo","bar");
        # prints "3"

DESCRIPTION
       This module implements the Levenshtein edit distance in a XS way.

       The Levenshtein edit distance is a measure of the degree of proximity
       between two strings.  This distance is the number of substitutions,
       deletions or insertions ("edits") needed to transform one string into
       the other one (and vice versa).  When two strings have distance 0, they
       are the same.  A good point to start is:

       and to Lorenzo Seidenari who made the C implementation
