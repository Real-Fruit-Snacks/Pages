NAME
       Test::Lintian::Templates -- Helper routines dealing with templates

SYNOPSIS
       use Test::Lintian::Templates qw(fill_template);

       my $data = { 'placeholder' => 'value' }; my $file =
       '/path/to/generated/file';

       fill_template("$file.in", $file, $data);

DESCRIPTION
       Routines for dealing with templates in Lintian test specifications.

FUNCTIONS
       copy_skeleton_template_sets(INSTRUCTIONS, RUN_PATH, SUITE, TEST_SET)
           Copies template sets belonging to SUITE into the test working
           directory RUN_PATH according to INSTRUCTIONS. The INSTRUCTIONS are
           the target directory relative to RUN_PATH followed by the name of
           the template set in parentheses. Multiple such instructions must be
           separated by commas.

       remove_surplus_templates(SRC_DIR, TARGET_DIR)
           Removes from TARGET_DIR any templates that have corresponding
           originals in SRC_DIR.

       fill_skeleton_templates(INSTRUCTIONS, HASH, EPOCH, RUN_PATH, TEST_SET)
           Fills the templates specified in INSTRUCTIONS using the data in
           HASH. Only fills templates when the generated files are not present
           or are older than either the file modification time of the template
           or the age of the data as evidenced by EPOCH. The INSTRUCTIONS are
           the target directory relative to RUN_PATH followed by the name of
           the whitelist in parentheses. Multiple instructions must be
           separated by commas.

       fill_whitelisted_templates(DIR, WHITE_LIST, HASH, HASH_EPOCH)
           Generates all files in array WHITE_LIST relative to DIR from their
           templates, which are assumed to have the same file name but with
           extension '.in', using data provided in HASH. The optional argument
           HASH_EPOCH can be used to preserve files when no generation is
           necessary.

       fill_all_templates(HASH, DIR)
           Fills all templates in DIR with data from HASH.

       fill_template(TEMPLATE, GENERATED, HASH, HASH_EPOCH, DELIMITERS)
           Fills template TEMPLATE with data from HASH and places the result
           in file GENERATED. When given HASH_EPOCH, will evaluate beforehand
           if a substitution is necessary based on file modification times.
           The optional parameter DELIMITERS can be used to change the
           standard delimiters.
