NAME

sd_bus_get_name_machine_id
- Retrieve a bus client's machine identity

SYNOPSIS

#include

int
sd_bus_get_name_machine_id(sd_bus *bus,
const char *name,
sd_id128_t *machine); 

DESCRIPTION

sd_bus_get_name_machine_id()
retrieves the D-Bus machine identity of the machine that the
bus client identified by name is running on.
Internally, it calls the GetMachineId method of the
org.freedesktop.DBus.Peer interface. The D-Bus
machine identity is a 128-bit UUID. On Linux systems running
systemd, this corresponds to the contents of
/etc/machine-id. On success, the machine identity is stored
in machine.

RETURN VALUE

On success,
this function returns a non-negative integer. On failure, it
returns a negative errno-style error code.

Errors

Returned errors may indicate the following problems:

-EINVAL

An argument is invalid.

-ENOPKG

The bus cannot be resolved.

-ECHILD

The bus was created in a
different process, library or module instance.

-ENOMEM

Memory allocation failed.

NOTES

Functions
described here are available as a shared library, which can
be compiled against and linked to with the
libsystemd pkg-config(1) file.

The code
described here uses getenv(3), which is declared to
be not multi-thread-safe. This means that the code calling
the functions described here must not call setenv(3)
from a parallel thread. It is recommended to only do calls
to setenv() from an early phase of the program when
no other threads have been started.

HISTORY
