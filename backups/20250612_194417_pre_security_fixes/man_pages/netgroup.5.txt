NAME

netgroup -
specify network groups

DESCRIPTION

The
netgroup file defines "netgroups", which
are sets of (host, user, domain) tuples, used for permission
checking when doing remote mounts,remote logins and remote
shells.

Each line in
the file consists of a netgroup name followed by a by a list
of members, where a member is either another netgroup name,
or a triple:

(host,
user, domain)

where the
host, user, and domain are character
strings for the corresponding components. Any of the three
fields can be empty, in which case it specifies a
"wildcard", or may consist of the string
"-" to specify "no valid value". The
domain field must either be the local domain name or
empty for the netgroup entry to be used. This field does not
limit the netgroup or provide security. The domain field
refers to the domain in which the triple is valid, not the
domain containing the the trusted host.

A gateway
machine should be listed under all possible hostnames by
which it may be recognized:

gateway
(server, , ) (server-sn, , ) (server-bb, , )

The
getnetgrent(3), function should normally be used to
access the netgroup database.

FILES

/etc/netgroup

WARNINGS

The triple
(,,domain) allows all users and machines trusted access, and
has the same effect as the triple (,,). Use the host
and user fields of the triple to restrict the access
correctly to a specific set of members.
