NAME

cc_cubic — CUBIC
Congestion Control Algorithm

DESCRIPTION

The CUBIC congestion control
algorithm was designed to provide increased throughput in
fast and long-distance networks. It attempts to maintain
fairness when competing with legacy NewReno TCP in lower
speed scenarios where NewReno is able to operate
adequately.

The congestion
window is increased as a function of the time elapsed since
the last congestion event. During regular operation, the
window increase function follows a cubic function, with the
inflection point set to be the congestion window value
reached at the last congestion event. CUBIC also calculates
an estimate of the congestion window that NewReno would have
achieved at a given time after a congestion event. When
updating the congestion window, the algorithm will choose
the larger of the calculated CUBIC and estimated NewReno
windows.

CUBIC also backs
off less on congestion by changing the multiplicative
decrease factor from 1/2 (used by standard NewReno TCP) to
4/5.

The
implementation was done in a clean-room fashion, and is
based on the Internet Draft and paper referenced in the
SEE ALSO section below.

The cc_cubic congestion
control module first appeared in FreeBSD 9.0.

The module was
first released in 2009 by Lawrence Stewart whilst studying
at Swinburne University of Technology’s Centre for
Advanced Internet Architectures, Melbourne, Australia. More
