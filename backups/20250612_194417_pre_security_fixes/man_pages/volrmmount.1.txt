NAME

volrmmount
− call rmmount to mount or unmount media

SYNOPSIS

volrmmount
[-i | -e] [name | nickname]

volrmmount
[-d]

DESCRIPTION

The
volrmmount utility calls rmmount(1M) to, in
effect, simulate an insertion (-i) or an ejection
(-e). Simulating an insertion often means that
rmmount will mount the media. Conversely, simulating
an ejection often means that rmmount will unmount the
media. However, these actions can vary depending on the
rmmount configuration and media type (see
rmmount.conf(4)).

For example, if
you use the default /etc/rmmount.conf and insert a
music CD, it will not be mounted. However, you can configure
rmmount so that it calls workman whenever a
music CD is inserted.

This command
allows you to override Volume Management’s usual
handling of media (see EXAMPLES below).

OPTIONS

The following
options are supported:

-i

Simulates an insertion of the specified media by calling
rmmount. 

-e

Simulates an ejection of the specified media by calling
rmmount. 

-d

Displays the name of the default device for
volrmmount to handle. This device is used if no
name or nickname is supplied.

OPERANDS

The following
operands are supported:

name

The name that Volume Management
recognizes as the device’s name. See
volfs(7FS). 

nickname

A shortened version of the
device’s name. Following is the list of recognized
nicknames:

EXAMPLES

Example 1:
Using the volrmmount command

When Volume
Management finds a floppy that contains a filesystem, it
calls rmmount to mount it. If you wish to run
tar(1) or cpio(1) on that floppy, it must
first be unmounted. To unmount the floppy use:

example%
volrmmount −e floppy0

After
volrmmount unmounts the floppy, if you wish to
re-mount it (rather than ejecting it and reinserting it)
use:

example%
volrmmount −i floppy0

Notice that if
you are using a named floppy, you can use its name in place
of floppy0.
