DESCRIPTION

The vt device provides
multiple virtual terminals with an extensive feature
set:

Unicode UTF-8
text with double-width characters.

Large font maps
in graphics mode, including support for Asian character
sets.

Graphics-mode
consoles.

Integration
with KMS (Kernel Mode Setting) video drivers for switching
between the X Window System and virtual
terminals.

Virtual
Terminals 
Multiple virtual terminals are provided on a single
computer. Up to sixteen virtual terminals can be defined. A
single virtual terminal is connected to the screen and
keyboard at a time. Key combinations are used to select a
virtual terminal. Alt-F1 through Alt-F12 correspond to the
first twelve virtual terminals. If more than twelve virtual
terminals are created, Shift-Alt-F1 through Shift-Alt-F4 are
used to switch to the additional terminals.

Copying and
Pasting Text with a Mouse 
Copying and pasting text from the screen with a mouse is
supported. Press and hold down mouse button 1, usually the
left button, while moving the mouse to select text. Selected
text is highlighted with reversed foreground and background
colors. To select more text after releasing mouse button 1,
press mouse button 3, usually the right button. To paste
text that has been selected, press mouse button 2, usually
the middle button. The text is entered as if it were typed
at the keyboard. The VT_TWOBUTTON_MOUSE kernel option can be
used with mice that only have two buttons. Setting this
option makes the second mouse button into the paste button.
See moused(8) for more information.

Scrolling
Back 
Output that has scrolled off the screen can be reviewed by
pressing the Scroll Lock key, then scrolling up and down
with the arrow keys. The Page Up and Page Down keys scroll
up or down a full screen at a time. The Home and End keys
jump to the beginning or end of the scrollback buffer. When
finished reviewing, press the Scroll Lock key again to
return to normal use.

DRIVER CONFIGURATION

Kernel Configuration
Options 
These kernel options control the vt driver.

TERMINAL_NORM_ATTR=attribute

TERMINAL_KERN_ATTR=attribute

These options change the
default colors used for normal and kernel text. Available
colors are defined in sys/terminal.h>. See
EXAMPLES below.

VT_MAXWINDOWS=N

Set the number of virtual
terminals to be created to N. The value defaults to
12.

VT_ALT_TO_ESC_HACK=1

When the Alt key is held down
while pressing another key, send an ESC sequence instead of
the Alt key.

VT_TWOBUTTON_MOUSE

If defined, swap the functions
of mouse buttons 2 and 3. In effect, this makes the
right-hand mouse button perform a paste. These options are
checked in the order shown.

SC_NO_CUTPASTE

Disable mouse support.

VT_FB_DEFAULT_WIDTH=X

Set the default width to
X.

VT_FB_DEFAULT_HEIGHT=Y

Set the default height to
Y.

BACKWARDS
COMPATIBILITY

Several options are provided for
compatibility with the previous console device, sc(4). These
options will be removed in a future FreeBSD version.

vt Option
Name sc Option Name 
TERMINAL_KERN_ATTR SC_KERNEL_CONS_ATTR 
TERMINAL_NORM_ATTR SC_NORM_ATTR 
VT_TWOBUTTON_MOUSE SC_TWOBUTTON_MOUSE 
VT_MAXWINDOWS MAXCONS 
none SC_NO_CUTPASTE

START-UP OPERATION WITH X86
BIOS SYSTEMS

The computer BIOS starts in text
mode, and the FreeBSD loader(8) runs, loading the kernel. If
hw.vga.textmode is set, the system remains in text
mode. Otherwise, vt switches to 640x480x16 VGA mode
using vt_vga. If a KMS (Kernel Mode Setting) video
driver is available, the display is switched to high
resolution and the KMS driver takes over. When a KMS driver
is not available, vt_vga remains active.

LOADER TUNABLES

These settings can be entered at
the loader(8) prompt or in loader.conf(5).

hw.vga.textmode

Set to 1 to use virtual
terminals in text mode instead of graphics mode. Features
that require graphics mode, like loadable fonts, will be
disabled.

hw.vga.acpi_ignore_no_vga

Set to 1 to force the usage of
the VGA driver regardless of whether ACPI IAPC_BOOT_ARCH
signals no VGA support. Can be used to workaround firmware
bugs in the ACPI tables.

kern.vty

Set this value to
’vt’ or ’sc’ to choose a specific
system console, overriding the default. The GENERIC
kernel uses vt when this value is not set.

kern.vt.color.colornum.rgb

Set this value to override
default palette entry for color colornum which should
be in a range from 0 to 15 inclusive. The value should be
either a comma-separated triplet of red, green, and blue
values in a range from 0 to 255 or HTML-like hex triplet.
See EXAMPLES below.

kern.vt.fb.default_mode

Set this value to a graphic
mode to override the default mode picked by the vt
backend. The mode is applied to all output connectors. This
is currently only supported by the vt_fb backend when
it is paired with a KMS video driver.

kern.vt.fb.modes.connector_name

Set this value to a graphic
mode to override the default mode picked by the vt
backend. This mode is applied to the output connector
connector_name only. It has precedence over
kern.vt.fb.default_mode. The names of available
connector names can be found in dmesg(8) after loading the
KMS driver. It will contain a list of connectors and their
associated tunables. This is currently only supported by the
vt_fb backend when it is paired with a KMS video
driver.

KEYBOARD SYSCTL
TUNABLES

These settings control whether
certain special key combinations are enabled or ignored. The
specific key combinations can be configured by using a
keymap(5) file.

These settings
can be entered at the loader(8) prompt or in loader.conf(5)
and can also be changed at runtime with the sysctl(8)
command.

kern.vt.kbd_halt

Enable halt keyboard
combination.

kern.vt.kbd_poweroff

Enable power off key
combination.

kern.vt.kbd_reboot

Enable reboot key combination,
usually Ctrl+Alt+Del.

kern.vt.kbd_debug

Enable debug request key
combination, usually Ctrl+Alt+Esc.

kern.vt.kbd_panic

Enable panic key
combination.

OTHER SYSCTL TUNABLES

These settings can be entered at
the loader(8) prompt, set in loader.conf(5), or changed at
runtime with sysctl(8).

kern.vt.enable_bell

Enable the terminal bell.

EXAMPLES

This example changes the default
color of normal text to green on a black background, or
black on a green background when reversed. Note that white
space cannot be used inside the attribute string because of
the current implementation of config(8).

options
TERMINAL_NORM_ATTR=(FG_GREEN|BG_BLACK)

This line
changes the default color of kernel messages to be bright
red on a black background, or black on a bright red
background when reversed.

options
TERMINAL_KERN_ATTR=(FG_LIGHTRED|BG_BLACK)

To set a
1024x768 mode on all output connectors, put the following
line in /boot/loader.conf:

kern.vt.fb.default_mode="1024x768"

To set a 800x600
only on a laptop builtin screen, use the following line
instead:

kern.vt.fb.modes.LVDS-1="800x600"

The connector
name was found in dmesg(8):

info: [drm]
Connector LVDS-1: get mode from tunables: 
info: [drm] - kern.vt.fb.modes.LVDS-1 
info: [drm] - kern.vt.fb.default_mode

To set black and
white colors of console palette

kern.vt.color.0.rgb="10,10,10"

kern.vt.color.15.rgb="#f0f0f0"
