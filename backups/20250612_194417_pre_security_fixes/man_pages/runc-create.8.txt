NAME

runc-create
- create a container

SYNOPSIS

runc
create [option ...] container-id

DESCRIPTION

The
create command creates an instance of a container
from a bundle. The bundle is a directory with a
specification file named config.json, and a root
filesystem.

OPTIONS

--bundle|-b
path

Path to the root of the bundle
directory. Default is current directory.

--console-socket
path

Path to an AF_UNIX
socket which will receive a file descriptor referencing the
master end of the console’s pseudoterminal. See
docs/terminals ⟨
https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/blob/master/docs/terminals.md⟩
.

--pid-file
path

Specify the file to write the
initial container process’ PID to.

--no-pivot

Do not use pivot root to jail
process inside rootfs. This should not be used except in
exceptional circumstances, and may be unsafe from the
security standpoint.

--no-new-keyring

Do not create a new session
keyring for the container. This will cause the container to
inherit the calling processes session key.

--preserve-fds
N

Pass N additional file
descriptors to the container (stdio +
$LISTEN_FDS + N in total). Default is
0.
