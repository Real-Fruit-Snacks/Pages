strip file name affixes

SYNOPSIS

basename
[ -d ] string [ suffix ]

DESCRIPTION

Basename
deletes any prefix ending in slash (/) and the
suffix, if present in string, from
string, and prints the result on the standard
output.

The -d
option instead prints the directory component, that is,
string up to but not including the final slash. If
the string contains no slash, a period and newline are
printed.
