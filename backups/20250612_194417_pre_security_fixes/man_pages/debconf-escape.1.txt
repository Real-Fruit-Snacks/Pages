NAME

debconf-escape
- helper when working with debconf’s escape
capability

SYNOPSIS

 debconf-escape -e 

DESCRIPTION

When debconf
has the ’escape’ capability set, it will expect
commands you send it to have backslashes and newlines
escaped (as "\\" and
"\n" respectively) and will in turn
escape backslashes and newlines in its replies. This can be
used, for example, to substitute multi-line strings into
templates, or to get multi-line extended descriptions
reliably using "METAGET".
