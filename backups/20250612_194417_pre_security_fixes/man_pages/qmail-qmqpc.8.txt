NAME

qmail-qmqpc -
queue a mail message via QMQP

SYNOPSIS

qmail-qmqpc

DESCRIPTION

qmail-qmqpc
offers the same interface as qmail-queue, but it
gives the message to a QMQP server instead of storing it
locally.

In a
mini-qmail installation, qmail-queue is
replaced with a symbolic link to qmail-qmqpc.

CONTROL FILES

qmqpservers

one address per line. qmail-qmqpc will try each
address in turn until it establishes a QMQP connection or
runs out of addresses.
