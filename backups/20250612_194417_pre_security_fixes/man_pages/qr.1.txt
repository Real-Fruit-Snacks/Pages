NAME
       qr - script to create QR codes at the command line

SYNOPSIS
       qr  [--help] [--factory=FACTORY] [--optimize=OPTIMIZE] [--error-correc-
       tion=LEVEL] [data]

DESCRIPTION
       This script uses the python qrcode module. It can take data from  stdin
       or  from the commandline and generate a QR code.  Normally it will out-
       put the QR code as ascii art to the terminal. If the output is piped to
       a file, it will output the image (default type of PNG).

OPTIONS
        -h, --help
           Show a help message.

        --factory=FACTORY
           Full  python  path  to  the image factory class to create the image
           with. You can use the following shortcuts  to  the  built-in  image
           factory  classes: pil (default), png ( default if pillow is not in-
           stalled), svg, svg-fragment, svg-path.

        --optimize=OPTIMIZE
           Optimize the data by looking for chunks of at least this many char-
           acters  that  could  use a more efficient encoding method. Use 0 to
           turn off chunk optimization.

        --error-correction=LEVEL
           The error correction level to use. Choices are L (7%), M (15%,  de-
           fault), Q (25%), and H (30%).

        data
           The data from which the QR code will be generated.
