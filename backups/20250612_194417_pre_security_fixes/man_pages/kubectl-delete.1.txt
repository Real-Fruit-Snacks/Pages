NAME

kubectl delete
- Delete resources by filenames, stdin, resources and names,
or by resources and label selector

SYNOPSIS

kubectl
delete [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION

Delete
resources by filenames, stdin, resources and names, or by
resources and label selector.

JSON and YAML
formats are accepted. Only one type of the arguments may be
specified: filenames, resources and names, or resources and
label selector.

Some resources,
such as pods, support graceful deletion. These resources
define a default period before they are forcibly terminated
(the grace period) but you may override that value with the
--grace-period flag, or pass --now to set a grace-period of
1. Because these resources often represent entities in the
cluster, deletion may not be acknowledged immediately. If
the node hosting a pod is down or cannot reach the API
server, termination may take significantly longer than the
grace period. To force delete a resource, you must specify
the --force flag. Note: only a subset of resources support
graceful deletion. In absence of the support, --grace-period
is ignored.

IMPORTANT:
Force deleting pods does not wait for confirmation that the
pod’s processes have been terminated, which can leave
those processes running until the node detects the deletion
and completes graceful deletion. If your processes use
shared storage or talk to a remote API and depend on the
name of the pod to identify themselves, force deleting those
pods may result in multiple processes running on different
machines using the same identification which may lead to
data corruption or inconsistency. Only force delete pods
when you are sure the pod is terminated, or if your
application can tolerate multiple copies of the same pod
running at once. Also, if you force delete pods the
scheduler may place new pods on those nodes before the node
has released those resources and causing those pods to be
evicted immediately.

Note that the
delete command does NOT do resource version checks, so if
someone submits an update to a resource right when you
submit a delete, their update will be lost along with the
rest of the resource.

OPTIONS

--all=false

Delete all resources, including uninitialized ones, in
the namespace of the specified resource types.

-A, --all-namespaces=false

If present, list the requested object(s) across all
namespaces. Namespace in current context is ignored even if
specified with --namespace.

--cascade="background"

Must be "background", "orphan", or
"foreground". Selects the deletion cascading
strategy for the dependents (e.g. Pods created by a
ReplicationController). Defaults to background.

--dry-run="none"

Must be "none", "server", or
"client". If client strategy, only print the
object that would be sent, without sending it. If server
strategy, submit server-side request without persisting the
resource. 

--field-selector=""

Selector (field query) to filter on, supports
’=’, ’==’, and
’!=’.(e.g. --field-selector
key1=value1,key2=value2). The server only supports a limited
number of field queries per type.

-f, --filename=[]

containing the resource to delete.

--force=false

If true, immediately remove resources from API and
bypass graceful deletion. Note that immediate deletion of
some resources may result in inconsistency or data loss and
requires confirmation.

--grace-period=-1

Period of time in seconds given to the resource to
terminate gracefully. Ignored if negative. Set to 1 for
immediate shutdown. Can only be set to 0 when --force is
true (force deletion).

--ignore-not-found=false

Treat "resource not found" as a successful
delete. Defaults to "true" when --all is
specified. 

-k, --kustomize=""

Process a kustomization directory. This flag can’t
be used together with -f or -R.

--now=false

If true, resources are signaled for immediate shutdown
(same as --grace-period=1).

-o, --output=""

Output mode. Use "-o name" for shorter output
(resource/name). 

--raw=""

Raw URI to DELETE to the server. Uses the transport
specified by the kubeconfig file.

-R, --recursive=false

Process the directory used in -f, --filename
recursively. Useful when you want to manage related
manifests organized within the same directory.

-l, --selector=""

Selector (label query) to filter on, not including
uninitialized ones.

--timeout=0s

The length of time to wait before giving up on a delete,
zero means determine a timeout from the size of the
object 

--wait=true

If true, wait for resources to be gone before returning.
This waits for finalizers.
