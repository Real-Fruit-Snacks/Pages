void
pcre2_serialize_free(uint8_t *bytes);

pcre2_serialize_encode() to hold a serialized byte
stream. The argument must point to such a byte stream or be
NULL, in which case the function returns without doing
anything.

pcre2api page and a description of the serialization
functions in the pcre2serialize page.
