NAME

systemd-backlight@.service,
systemd-backlight - Load and save the display backlight
brightness at boot and shutdown

SYNOPSIS

systemd-backlight@.service

/usr/lib/systemd/systemd-backlight
save [backlight|leds]:DEVICE

/usr/lib/systemd/systemd-backlight
load [backlight|leds]:DEVICE

DESCRIPTION

systemd-backlight@.service
is a service that restores the brightness of a display
backlight or LED (e.g. keyboard backlight) device at early
boot, and saves it at shutdown. The brightness is stored in
/var/lib/systemd/backlight/.

On restoring
brightness of a display backlight device,
systemd-backlight reads ID_BACKLIGHT_CLAMP
udev property, that takes a boolean value or a percentage
(needs to be suffixed with "%", e.g.
"30%"). When a percentage is specified, the saved
brightness is clamped to a value of at least 1 or the
specified percentage of the maximum brightness, whichever is
greater. When unset or set to true, the brightness is
clamped in the same way with percentage 5%. When false, the
saved brightness will not be clamped, and loaded as is.

On restoring
brightness of a LED device, systemd-backlight reads
ID_LEDS_CLAMP udev property, that also takes a
boolean value or a percentage. When a percentage is
specified, the saved brightness is clamped to the specified
percentage of the maximum brightness. When set to true, the
brightness is clamped in the same way with percentage 5%.
When unset or set to false, the saved brightness will not be
clamped, and loaded as is.

KERNEL COMMAND LINE

systemd-backlight
understands the following kernel command line parameter:

systemd.restore_state=

Takes a boolean argument.
Defaults to "1". If "0", does not
restore the backlight settings on boot. However, settings
will still be stored on shutdown.

Added in
version 209.
