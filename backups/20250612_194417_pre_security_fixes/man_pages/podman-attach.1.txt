DESCRIPTION

podman

the containerâ€™s name or ID, to either
view its ongoing output or to control it interactively. 
The container can be detached from (and leave it
running) using a configurable key sequence. The default
sequence is ctrl-p,ctrl-q. Configure the keys
sequence using the --detach-keys OPTION, or
specifying it in the containers.conf file: see
containers.conf(5) for more information.

This option can
also be set in containers.conf(5) file.

Instead of providing the container name or ID, use the last
