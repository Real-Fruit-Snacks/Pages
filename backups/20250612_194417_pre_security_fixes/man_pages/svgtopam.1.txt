NAME

svgtopam -
convert an SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) image to Netpbm
format

SYNOPSIS

svgtopam
[-trace] [pnmfile]

Minimum unique
abbreviation of option is acceptable. You may use double
hyphens instead of single hyphen to denote options. You may
use white space in place of the equals sign to separate an
option name from its value.

DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

svgtopam
reads an SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) image as input and
produces a PAM image as output.

svgtopam
is so weak that it is probably not useful in general for
converting SVG images. It understands only  SVG
elements which use only the "M", "L",
and "z" commands, and only those that use whole
number arguments. This is sufficient for converting most of
what comes out of pamtosvg (not by coincidence - the
program was developed for the specific task of testing
pamtosvg), but the main reason it is part of Netpbm
is to provide a base for someone to create a full SVG to
Netpbm converter.

SVG is a vector
image format, which means it describes curves that compose
an image. By contrast, PNM is a raster format, which means
it describes dots that compose an image. The main practical
difference between the two types is that you can scale
vector images better. A vector image also takes a lot less
data to describe an image if the image is composed of simple
curves.

That means it
is really an understatement to say that svgtopam is
an image format converter. It’s really an image
drawer, not unlike ppmdraw.

OPTIONS

In addition to
the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most
notably -quiet, see
 Common Options ),
svgtopam recognizes the following command line
option:

-trace

This option makes svgtopam issue messages
describing the drawing.

HISTORY

svgtopam
was added to Netpbm in Version 10.34 (May 2006).

Bryan Henderson
created svgtopam to test pamtosvg.
