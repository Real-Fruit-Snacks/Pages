NAME

nbd_aio_cache -
send cache (prefetch) command to the NBD server

SYNOPSIS

#include

typedef struct { 
int (*callback) (void *user_data, int *error); 
void *user_data; 
void (*free) (void *user_data); 
} nbd_completion_callback; 
int64_t nbd_aio_cache ( 
struct nbd_handle *h, uint64_t count, 
uint64_t offset, 
nbd_completion_callback completion_callback, 
uint32_t flags 
);

DESCRIPTION

Issue the cache
(prefetch) command to the NBD server.

To check if the
command completed, call nbd_aio_command_completed(3).
Or supply the optional "completion_callback" which
will be invoked as described in "Completion
callbacks" in libnbd(3).

Other
parameters behave as documented in nbd_cache(3).

By default,
libnbd will reject attempts to use this function with
parameters that are likely to result in server failure, such
as requesting an unknown command flag. The
nbd_set_strict_mode(3) function can be used to alter
which scenarios should await a server reply rather than
failing fast.

RETURN VALUE

This call
returns the 64 bit cookie of the command. The cookie is ≥
1. Cookies are unique (per libnbd handle, not globally).

ERRORS

On error -1 is
returned.

Refer to
"ERROR HANDLING" in libnbd(3) for how to
get further details of the error.

The following
parameters must not be NULL: "h". For more
information see "Non-NULL parameters" in
libnbd(3).

HANDLE STATE

nbd_aio_cache
can be called when the handle is in the following state:

┌─────────────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────┐

│ Handle created, before connecting │ ❌
error │ 
│ Connecting │ ❌ error │ 
│ Connecting & handshaking (opt_mode) │
❌ error │ 
│ Connected to the server │ ✅ allowed
│ 
│ Connection shut down │ ❌ error │

│ Handle dead │ ❌ error │ 

└─────────────────────────────────────┴─────────────────────────┘

VERSION

This function
first appeared in libnbd 1.0.

If you need to
test if this function is available at compile time check if
the following macro is defined:

#define
LIBNBD_HAVE_NBD_AIO_CACHE 1
