NAME

pmGetInDom
- get instance identifiers for a performance metrics
instance domain

C SYNOPSIS

#include

int
pmGetInDom(pmInDom indom, int
**instlist, char
***namelist);

cc ...
-lpcp

DESCRIPTION

In the current
Performance Metrics Application Programming Interface
(PMAPI) context, locate the description of the instance
domain indom, and return via instlist the
internal instance identifiers for all instances, and via
namelist the full external identifiers for all
instances. The number of instances found is returned as the
function value (else less than zero to indicate an
error).

The value for
the instance domain indom is typically extracted from
a pmDesc structure, following a call to
pmLookupDesc(3) for a particular performance
metric.

The resulting
lists of instance identifiers (instlist and
namelist), and the names that the elements of
namelist point to, will have been allocated by
pmGetInDom with two calls to malloc(3), and it
is the responsibility of the caller to free(instlist)
and free(namelist) to release the space when it is no
longer required.

When the result
of pmGetInDom is less than one, both instlist
and namelist are undefined (no space will have been
allocated, and so calling free(3) is a singularly bad
idea).

DIAGNOSTICS

PM_ERR_INDOM

indom is not a valid
instance domain identifier

PCP ENVIRONMENT

Environment
variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On
each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains
the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5). Values for these
variables may be obtained programmatically using the
pmGetConfig(3) function.
