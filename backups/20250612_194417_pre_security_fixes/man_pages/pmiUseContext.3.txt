DESCRIPTION

As part of the
Performance Co-Pilot Log Import API (see
LOGIMPORT(3)), pmiUseContext may be used by
applications wishing to generate more than one PCP archive
concurrently.

The
context argument is a value returned from a previous
call to pmStart(3) and on successful return from
pmiUseContext, the current context will have been
changed to the one identified by context.

DIAGNOSTICS

pmiUseContext
returns zero on success else a negative value that can be
turned into an error message by calling
pmiErrStr(3).
