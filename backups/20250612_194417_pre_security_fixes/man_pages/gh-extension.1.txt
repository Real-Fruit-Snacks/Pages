gh-extension -
Manage gh extensions

SYNOPSIS

gh extension
[flags]

DESCRIPTION

GitHub CLI
extensions are repositories that provide additional gh
commands.

The name of the
extension repository must start with gh- and it must
contain an executable of the same name. All arguments passed
to the gh  invocation will be
forwarded to the gh- executable of the
extension.

An extension
cannot override any of the core gh commands. If an extension
name conflicts with a core gh command, you can use gh
extension exec .

For the list of
available extensions, see ⟨
https://github.com/topics/gh-extension⟩ .
