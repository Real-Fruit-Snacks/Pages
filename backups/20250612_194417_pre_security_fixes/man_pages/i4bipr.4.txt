I4BIPR(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual I4BIPR(4)

NAME

i4bipr â€” isdn4bsd
IP over ISDN B-channel network driver

SYNOPSIS

device
"i4bipr" [count]

DESCRIPTION

The i4bipr driver
interfaces the IP subsystem of the operating system with the
isdn4bsd package so that transport of IP packets over an
ISDN link is possible.

The driver just
packs IP packets without anything appended or prepended into
raw HDLC packets on the B channel and transfers them to a
remote site. IP packets received from the remote site are
queued into the local IP protocol stack.

The format of
the resulting packet on the B channel is:

(HDLC opening
flag) (IP-packet) (CRC) (HDLC closing flag)

In the case
where an IP packet for a remote site arrives in the driver
and no connection has been established yet, the driver
communicates with the isdnd(8) daemon to establish a
connection.

The driver has
support for interfacing to the bpf(4) subsystem for using
tcpdump(1) with the ipr interfaces.

The driver
optionally (when compiled with the IPR_VJ option) provides
Van Jacobsen header compression, under control of the link0
and link1 options to ifconfig(8):

link0

Apply VJ
compression to outgoing packets on this interface, and
assume that incoming packets require decompression.

link1

Check incoming
packets for Van Jacobsen compression; if they appear to be
compressed, automatically set link0.

The default
values are on for link1 and off for
link0.
