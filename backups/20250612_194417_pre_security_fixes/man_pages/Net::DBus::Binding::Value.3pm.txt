NAME
       Net::DBus::Binding::Value - Strongly typed data value

SYNOPSIS
         # Import the convenience functions
         use Net::DBus qw(:typing);

         # Call a method with passing an int32
         $object->doit(dint32("3"));

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides a simple wrapper around a raw Perl value,
       associating an explicit DBus type with the value. This is used in cases
       where a client is communicating with a server which does not provide
       introspection data, but for which the basic data types are not
       sufficient. This class should not be used directly, rather the
       convenience functions in Net::DBus be called.

METHODS
       my $value = Net::DBus::Binding::Value->new($type, $value);
           Creates a wrapper for the perl value $value marking it as having
           the dbus data type $type. It is not necessary to call this method
           directly, instead the data typing methods in the Net::DBus object
           should be used.

       my $raw = $value->value
           Returns the raw perl value wrapped by this object

       my $type = $value->type
           Returns the dbus data type this value is marked as having
