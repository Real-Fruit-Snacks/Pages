DESCRIPTION

The urio driver provides
support for Rio MP3 players from Diamond MultiMedia which
attaches to the USB port. The urio device must be
configured in the kernel, along with usb and one of
the uhci or ohci controllers.

Subsequently,
the /dev/urio0 device can be used by the Rio userland
applications.

supported by the urio driver:

http://rio500.sourceforge.net/ .

The Rio500 tools
from SourceForge are the actual userland tools used to
download, format or rename songs on players. When compiling
these tools, the following pre-build configuration command
will ensure that rio_usb.h is available in the
include path and that the device used is
/dev/urio0:

CFLAGS="-I/usr/include/dev/usb"
./configure \ 
--with-devicepath=’/dev’
--with-deviceentry=’urio0’
