NAME

strnlen -
determine the length of a fixed-size string

SYNOPSIS

#include

size_t
strnlen(const char *s, size_t
maxlen);

Feature Test
Macro Requirements for glibc (see
feature_test_macros(7)):

strnlen():

Since glibc 2.10:

_POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200809L

Before glibc 2.10:

_GNU_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION

The
strnlen() function returns the number of bytes in the
string pointed to by s, excluding the terminating
null byte ('\0'), but at most maxlen. In doing this,
strnlen() looks only at the first maxlen
characters in the string pointed to by s and never
beyond s+maxlen.

RETURN VALUE

The
strnlen() function returns strlen(s), if that
is less than maxlen, or maxlen if there is no
null terminating ('\0') among the first maxlen
characters pointed to by s.
