NAME

pmsearch
- help text and names search for metrics, instances and
instance domains

SYNOPSIS

pmsearch
[-CdinqsStTV?] [-c config] [-h
host] [-p port] [-N
number] [-O offset] [query |
indom]

DESCRIPTION

pmsearch
performs full text search queries to find metrics using
names and help text from metrics, instance domains and
instances.

It makes use of
capabilties of the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP)
pmproxy(1) service, the Redis distributed data store,
and the RediSearch module.

Note that in
order to use these services, it is mandatory that
pmproxy is communicating with a
redis-server(1) that has the redisearch.so
module loaded. When configured to do so, pmproxy will
then automatically index PCP metric names, instance names,
metric and instance domain help text into the RediSearch
store, from PCP archives that it discovers locally. Refer to
pmlogger(1) and pmlogger_daily(1) for further
details.

By default
pmsearch communicates with a local
redis-server(1), however the -h and -p
options can be used to specify an alternate Redis instance.
If this instance is a node of a Redis cluster, all other
instances in the cluster will be discovered and used
automatically.

OPTIONS

-c
config, --config=config

Specify the config file
to use.

-C,
--no-colour

text.

-d, --docid

Report document ID of each
search result. Documents are identified using a unique SHA-1
hash which is always displayed in a 40-hexdigit human
readable form.

-h host,
--host=host

Connect to the Redis server at
host, rather than the one the localhost.

-i, --info

Report search engine internal
metrics.

-n, --indom

Perform an instance
domain related entities search

-N N,
--number=N

Return N, search results
at most.

-O N,
--offset=N

Paginated results from given
offset.

-p port,
--port=port

Connect to the Redis server at
port, rather than the default 6379.

-q, --query

Perform a general text search
(default).

-s, --suggest

Peform a name suggestion
search

-S, --score

Report score (rank) of each
result.

-T, --total

Report total number of of

-t, --times

Report elapsed search execution
time.

-V, --version

-?, --help

Display usage message and

EXAMPLES

$ pmsearch
kernel idle 
Type: metric 
Name: kernel.all.cpu.idle

CPUs

Type: metric

Name: kernel.all.idletime 
One line: time the current kernel has been
idle since boot

Type: metric

Name: kernel.percpu.cpu.idle 
InDom: 60.0 
One line: percpu idle CPU time metric from
/proc/stat

PCP ENVIRONMENT

Environment
variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On
each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains
the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).

For environment
variables affecting PCP tools, see
pmGetOptions(3).
