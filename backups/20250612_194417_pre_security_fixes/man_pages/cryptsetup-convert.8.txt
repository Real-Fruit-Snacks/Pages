NAME

cryptsetup-convert
- converts the device between LUKS1 and LUKS2 format

SYNOPSIS

cryptsetup
convert --type  []

DESCRIPTION

Converts the
device between LUKS1 and LUKS2 format (if possible). The
conversion will not be performed if there is an additional
LUKS2 feature or LUKS1 has unsupported header size.

Conversion
(both directions) must be performed on inactive device.
There must not be active dm-crypt mapping established for
LUKS header requested for conversion.

The
--type option is mandatory with the following
accepted values: luks1 or luks2.

WARNING:
The convert action can destroy the LUKS header in the
case of a crash during conversion or if a media error
occurs. Always create a header backup before performing this
operation!

can be [--header, --type, --disable-locks].

OPTIONS

--batch-mode,
-q

Suppresses all confirmation
questions. Use with care!

If the
--verify-passphrase option is not specified, this option
also switches off the passphrase verification.

--debug or
--debug-json

Run in debug mode with full
diagnostic logs. Debug output lines are always prefixed by
#.

If --debug-json
is used, additional LUKS2 JSON data structures are
printed.

--disable-locks

Disable lock protection for
metadata on disk. This option is valid only for LUKS2 and
ignored for other formats.

WARNING:
Do not use this option unless you run cryptsetup in a
restricted environment where locking is impossible to
perform (where /run directory cannot be used).

--header

Use a detached (separated)
metadata device or file where the LUKS header is stored.
This option allows one to store ciphertext and LUKS header
on different devices.

For commands
that change the LUKS header (e.g. luksAddKey),
specify the device or file with the LUKS header directly as
the LUKS device.

--help,
-?

Show help text and default
parameters.

--type

Specifies required device type,
for more info read BASIC ACTIONS section in
cryptsetup(8).

--usage

Show short option help.

--version,
-V

Show the program version.

REPORTING BUGS

Report bugs at
cryptsetup mailing list
cryptsetup [AT] lists.dev> or in Issues project
section
https://gitlab.com/cryptsetup/cryptsetup/-/issues/new>.

Please
attach output of the failed command with --debug option
added.
