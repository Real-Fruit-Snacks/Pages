NAME

sq cert export
- Export certificates from the local certificate store

SYNOPSIS

sq cert
export [OPTIONS] QUERY

DESCRIPTION

Export
certificates from the local certificate store.

If multiple
predicates are specified a certificate is returned if at
least one of them matches.

This does not
check the authenticity of the certificates in anyway. Before
using the certificates, be sure to validate and authenticate
them.

When matching
on subkeys or User IDs, the component must have a valid self
signature according to the policy. This is not the case when
matching the certificate’s key handle using
’--cert’ or when exporting all certificates.

Fails if search
criteria are specified and none of them matches any
certificates. Note: this means if the certificate store is
empty and no search criteria are specified, then this will
return success.

EXAMPLES

Export all
certificates.

sq cert export

--userid "Alice alice [AT] example.org>"

Export
certificates with a User ID containing the email address.
The binding signatures are checked, but the User IDs are not
authenticated. Note: this check is case insensitive.

sq cert export
--email alice [AT] example.org

Export
certificates where the certificate (i.e., the primary key)
has the specified Key ID.

sq cert export
