NAME

dh_icons -
Update caches of Freedesktop icons

SYNOPSIS

dh_icons
[debhelper options] [-n]

DESCRIPTION

dh_icons
is a debhelper program that updates caches of Freedesktop
icons when needed, using the update-icon-caches
program provided by GTK+2.12. Currently this
program does not handle installation of the files, though it
may do so at a later date, so should be run after icons are
installed in the package build directories.

It takes care
of adding maintainer script fragments to call
update-icon-caches for icon directories. (This is not
done for gnome and hicolor icons, as those are handled by
triggers.) These commands are inserted into the maintainer
scripts by dh_installdeb(1).

OPTIONS

-n,
--no-scripts

Do not modify maintainer
scripts.
