NAME

nbdkit-readonly-filter
- switch a plugin between read-only and writable

SYNOPSIS

nbdkit
--filter=readonly PLUGIN 
nbdkit --filter=readonly PLUGIN readonly-file=/tmp/ro

DESCRIPTION

"nbdkit-readonly-filter"
is an nbdkit filter that has two modes:

•

When the "readonly-file" parameter is
not used, make the underlying plugin completely
read-only. This is similar to using the nbdkit -r
option on the command line.

•

When the "readonly-file" parameter is used,
make the underlying plugin read-only when that file is
present on disk, but leave it writable when the file is not
present (or if the file is deleted). This way you can switch
a plugin between being writable and write-protected at run
time. 

Trying to write
to the filter when the filter is enforcing read-only mode
will cause "EPERM" ("Operation not
permitted") to be returned to the client.

nbdkit-protect-filter(1)
is a related filter which can write-protect parts of a
plugin (eg only the boot sector).
nbdkit-error-filter(1) is another filter which can be
used for the same purpose as this filter but is more
complicated to use. See also the -r option described
in the nbdkit(1) manual.

EXAMPLE

Make a disk
read-only 60 seconds after nbdkit is started:

rm -f /tmp/ro

nbdkit --filter=readonly file disk.img readonly-file=/tmp/ro

sleep 60; touch /tmp/ro

PARAMETERS

readonly-file=PATHNAME

If this parameter is used, the
filter makes the underlying plugin read-only when
PATHNAME exists, otherwise the plugin is writable as
usual.

If this
parameter is not used, the filter always makes the
underlying plugin read-only.

FILES

$filterdir/nbdkit-readonly-filter.so

The filter.

Use
"nbdkit --dump-config" to find the location of
$filterdir.

VERSION

"nbdkit-readonly-filter"
first appeared in nbdkit 1.38.
