NAME

queue-pr
− incoming mail control for GNATS

SYNOPSIS

queue-pr

[ −q
| −−queue ] [ −r |
−−run ]

[ −f
filename | −−file=filename
] 
[ −m kbytes |
−−max-size=kbytes ] 
[ −d database |
−−database=database ] 
[ −h | −−help ] [
−V | −−version ]

DESCRIPTION

’queue-pr
-q’ should run through a pipe(2V) via the
mail aliases(5) mechanism to automatically place
incoming bug reports in a queue directory for
GNATS.

Run
’queue-pr -r’ via cron(8) to
periodically empty the GNATS queue, filing new bug
reports in the database.

Always use one
of −q | −−queue or
−r | −−run (but not both),
in each call to queue-pr. These are mutually
exclusive functions in order to avoid collisions.

OPTIONS

−q,
−−queue

Accept standard input as an
incoming mail message, placing this message in an
incrementally numbered file in the database subdirectory
gnats-queue for future handling.

−r, −−run

Redirect files from the database subdirectory
gnats-queue to file-pr(8) which files and
creates index entries for each.

−f filename
or −−file=filename

Treat filename as input
rather than reading from standard input (used with the
−−queue option).

−m kbytes,
−−max-size=kbytes

Do not process messages larger
than kbytes kilobytes in size. Files larger than the limit
are left for human intervention.

−d database
or −−database=databasename

Used with the
−−queue or −−run
options, use the database named database rather than
the database default or the database specified by the
GNATSDB environment variable.

-h, --help

Displays a short usage
message.

-V, --version

Displays the queue-pr
version number.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

The
GNATSDB environment variable is used to determine
which database to use. For a local database, it contains the
name of the database to access. If GNATSDB is not
set, the database named default is used.
