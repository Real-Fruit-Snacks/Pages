DEVICE.HINTS(5) BSD File Formats Manual
DEVICE.HINTS(5)

NAME

device.hints —
device resource hints

DESCRIPTION

The device.hints file is
read in by the boot loader(8) when the system is about to
start, and its contents are passed to the kernel. It
contains various variables to control the boot behavior of
the kernel. These variables are typically
’’device hints’’.

The file
contains one variable per line. Lines starting with the
’#’ character are comments and are ignored by
the boot loader.

After the file
is read by the boot loader, you may examine the variables
with the show command, and may add a new variable,
modify an existing one, or delete a variable with the
set and unset commands of the boot loader (see
loader(8)).

After the system
has started, you can dump these variables with the kenv(1)
command.

DEVICE HINTS

Device hint variables are used
by device drivers to set up the device. They are most often
used by ISA device drivers to specify where the driver will
probe for the relevant devices, and what resources it will
attempt to use.

A device hint
line looks like:

hint.driver.unit.keyword="value"

where
driver is the name of a device driver, unit is
the unit number, and keyword is the keyword of the
hint. The keyword may be:

at

specifies a bus
to which the device is attached.

port

specifies the
start address of I/O ports to be used by the device.

portsize

specifies the
number of ports used by the device.

irq

is the
interrupt line number to be used.

drq

is the DMA
channel number.

maddr

specifies the
physical memory address used by the device.

msize

specifies the
physical memory size used by the device.

flags

sets various
flag bits for the device.

disabled

can be set to
"1" to disable the device.

A device driver
may require one or more hint lines with these keywords, and
may accept other keywords not listed here. Consult
individual device drivers’ manual pages for available
keywords and their possible values.

FILES 
/boot/device.hints

Device resource
hints file.

/sys/ARCH/conf/GENERIC.hints

Sample resource
hints for the GENERIC kernel.

/sys/ARCH/conf/NOTES

Notes on the
kernel configuration file and device resource hints.

EXAMPLES

The following example sets up
resources for the sio(4) driver on the ISA bus:

hint.sio.0.at="isa"

hint.sio.0.port="0x3F8" 
hint.sio.0.flags="0x10" 
hint.sio.0.irq="4"

The following
example disables the ACPI driver:

hint.acpi.0.disabled="1"
