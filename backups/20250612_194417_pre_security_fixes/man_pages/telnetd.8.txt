NAME

telnetd — DARPA
TELNET protocol server

SYNOPSIS

telnetd
[options ...]

DESCRIPTION

The telnetd command is a
server which supports the DARPA standard TELNET virtual
terminal protocol. telnetd is normally invoked by the
internet server (see inetd(8)) for requests to connect to
the TELNET port as indicated by the /etc/services
file (see services(5)).

OPTIONS

The telnetd command
accepts the following options:

-a, --authmode
authmode

This option may be used for
specifying what mode should be used for authentication. Note
that this option is only useful if telnetd has been
compiled with support for the AUTHENTICATION option. There
are several valid values for authmode:

user

Only allow
connections when the remote user can provide valid
authentication information to identify the remote user, and
is allowed access to the specified account without providing
a password.

valid

Only allow
connections when the remote user can provide valid
authentication information to identify the remote user. The
login(1) command will provide any additional user
verification needed if the remote user is not allowed
automatic access to the specified account.

other

Only allow
connections that supply some authentication information.
This option is currently not supported by any of the
existing authentication mechanisms, and is thus the same as
specifying -a valid.

none

This is the
default state. Authentication information is not required.
If no or insufficient authentication information is
provided, then the login(1) program will provide the
necessary user verification.

off

This disables
the authentication code. All user verification will happen
through the login(1) program.

-S,
--server-principal name

Set the Kerberos principal name
for this server instance, with or without an explicit
realm.

-X,
--disable-auth-type authtype

This option is only valid if
telnetd has been built with support for the
authentication option. It disables the use of
authtype authentication, and can be used to
temporarily disable a specific authentication type without
having to recompile telnetd.

-D, --debug
[debugmode]

This option may be used for
debugging purposes. This allows telnetd to print out
debugging information to the connection, allowing the user
to see what telnetd is doing. There are several
possible values for debugmode:

options

Prints
information about the negotiation of TELNET options.

report

Prints the
options information, plus some additional information
about what processing is going on.

netdata

Displays the
data stream received by telnetd.

ptydata

Displays data
written to the pty.

auth

Displays
authentication information.

encr

Displays
encryption information.

-E, --exec-login
string

Set the program to be executed
instead of /bin/login.

-h,
--no-hostinfo

Disables the printing of
host-specific information before login has been
completed.

-l, --linemode
[mode]

Specifies line mode. Tries to
force clients to use line- at-a-time mode. If mode is
nokludge, then automatic klugde linemode will be
disabled. If the LINEMODE option is not supported, it will
go into kludge linemode.

-n,
--no-keepalive

Disable TCP keep-alives.
Normally telnetd enables the TCP keep-alive mechanism
to probe connections that have been idle for some period of
time to determine if the client is still there, so that idle
connections from machines that have crashed or can no longer
be reached may be cleaned up.

-U,
--reverse-lookup

This option causes
telnetd to refuse connections from addresses that
cannot be mapped back into a symbolic name via the
gethostbyaddr(3) routine.

-?, --help

Display a help
list.

--usage

Display a short
usage message.

-V, --version

Display program version.

OPERATION

telnetd operates by
allocating a pseudo-terminal device (see pty(4)) for a
client, then creating a login process which has the slave
side of the pseudo-terminal as stdin, stdout and stderr.
telnetd manipulates the master side of the
pseudo-terminal, implementing the TELNET protocol and
passing characters between the remote client and the login
process.

When a TELNET
session is started up, telnetd sends TELNET options
to the client side indicating a willingness to do the
following TELNET options, which are described in more detail
below:

DO
AUTHENTICATION 
WILL ENCRYPT 
DO TERMINAL TYPE 
DO TSPEED 
DO XDISPLOC 
DO NEW-ENVIRON 
DO ENVIRON 
WILL SUPPRESS GO AHEAD 
DO ECHO 
DO LINEMODE 
DO NAWS 
WILL STATUS 
DO LFLOW 
DO TIMING-MARK

The
pseudo-terminal allocated to the client is configured to
operate in “cooked” mode, and with XTABS and
CRMOD enabled (see tty(4)).

telnetd
has support for enabling locally the following TELNET
options:

WILL ECHO

When the
LINEMODE option is enabled, a WILL ECHO or WONT ECHO will be
sent to the client to indicate the current state of terminal
echoing. When terminal echo is not desired, a WILL ECHO is
sent to indicate that telnetd will take care of echoing any
data that needs to be echoed to the terminal, and then
nothing is echoed. When terminal echo is desired, a WONT
ECHO is sent to indicate that telnetd will not be doing any
terminal echoing, so the client should do any terminal
echoing that is needed.

WILL BINARY

Indicates that
the client is willing to send a 8 bits of data, rather than
the normal 7 bits of the Network Virtual Terminal.

WILL SGA

Indicates that
it will not be sending IAC GA, go ahead, commands.

WILL STATUS

Indicates a
willingness to send the client, upon request, of the current
status of all TELNET options.

WILL TIMING-MARK

Whenever a DO
TIMING-MARK command is received, it is always responded to
with a WILL TIMING-MARK

WILL LOGOUT

When a DO
LOGOUT is received, a WILL LOGOUT is sent in response, and
the TELNET session is shut down.

WILL ENCRYPT

Only sent if
telnetd is compiled with support for data encryption,
and indicates a willingness to decrypt the data stream.

telnetd
has support for enabling remotely the following TELNET
options:

DO BINARY

Sent to
indicate that telnetd is willing to receive an 8 bit data
stream.

DO LFLOW

Requests that
the client handle flow control characters remotely.

DO ECHO

This is not
really supported, but is sent to identify a 4.2BSD telnet(1)
client, which will improperly respond with WILL ECHO. If a
WILL ECHO is received, a DONT ECHO will be sent in
response.

DO TERMINAL-TYPE

Indicates a
desire to be able to request the name of the type of
terminal that is attached to the client side of the
connection.

DO SGA

Indicates that
it does not need to receive IAC GA, the go ahead
command.

DO NAWS

Requests that
the client inform the server when the window (display) size
changes.

DO TERMINAL-SPEED

Indicates a
desire to be able to request information about the speed of
the serial line to which the client is attached.

DO XDISPLOC

Indicates a
desire to be able to request the name of the X windows
display that is associated with the telnet client.

DO NEW-ENVIRON

Indicates a
desire to be able to request environment variable
information, as described in RFC 1572.

DO ENVIRON

Indicates a
desire to be able to request environment variable
information, as described in RFC 1408.

DO LINEMODE

Only sent if
telnetd is compiled with support for linemode, and
requests that the client do line by line processing.

DO TIMING-MARK

Only sent if
telnetd is compiled with support for both linemode
and kludge linemode, and the client responded with WONT
LINEMODE. If the client responds with WILL TM, the it is
assumed that the client supports kludge linemode. Note that
the [-k] option can be used to disable this.

DO AUTHENTICATION

Only sent if
telnetd is compiled with support for authentication,
and indicates a willingness to receive authentication
information for automatic login.

DO ENCRYPT

Only sent if
telnetd is compiled with support for data encryption,
and indicates a willingness to decrypt the data stream.

BUGS

Some TELNET commands are only
partially implemented.

Because of bugs
in the original 4.2 BSD telnet(1), telnetd performs
some dubious protocol exchanges to try to discover if the
remote client is, in fact, a 4.2 BSD telnet(1).

Binary mode has
no common interpretation except between similar operating
systems (Unix in this case).

The terminal
type name received from the remote client is converted to
lower case.

telnetd
never sends TELNET IAC GA (go ahead) commands.
