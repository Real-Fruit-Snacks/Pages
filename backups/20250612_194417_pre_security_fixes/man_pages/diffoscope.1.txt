NAME

diffoscope -
in-depth comparison of files, archives, and directories

SYNOPSIS

diffoscope
--help 
diffoscope [OPTIONS] [--json output_diff]
path1 path2 
diffoscope [OPTIONS] diff 
diffoscope [OPTIONS] diff

DESCRIPTION

diffoscope will
try to get to the bottom of what makes files or directories
different. It will recursively unpack archives of many kinds
and transform various binary formats into more
human-readable form to compare them. It can compare two
tarballs, ISO images, or PDF just as easily.

It can be
scripted through error codes, and a report can be produced
with the detected differences. The report can be text or
HTML. When no type of report has been selected, diffoscope
defaults to write a text report on the standard output.

diffoscope was
initially started by the "reproducible builds"
Debian project and now being developed as part of the
(wider) ???Reproducible Builds??? initiative. It is
meant to be able to quickly understand why two builds of the
same package produce different outputs. diffoscope was
previously named debbindiff.

See the
COMMAND-LINE EXAMPLES section further below to get
you started, as well as more detailed explanations of all
the command-line options. The same information is also
available in /usr/share/doc/diffoscope/README.rst or
similar.

path1

First file or directory to compare. Specify
"-" to read a diffoscope diff from stdin.

path2

Second file or directory to compare. If omitted, no
comparison is done but instead we read a diffoscope diff
from path1 and will output this in the formats specified by
the rest of the command line.

optional
arguments: 
--debug

Display debug messages

--pdb

Open the Python pdb debugger in case of crashes

--status-fd FD

Send machine-readable status to
file descriptor FD

--progress,
--no-progress

Show an approximate progress
bar. Default: yes if stdin is a tty, otherwise no.

--no-default-limits

Disable most default output
limits and diff calculation limits.

output
types: 
--text OUTPUT_FILE

Write plain text output to
given file (use - for stdout)

--text-color WHEN

When to output color diff. WHEN
is one of {never, auto, always}. Default: auto, meaning yes
if the output is a terminal, otherwise no.

--output-empty

If there was no difference,
then output an empty diff for each output type that was
specified. In --text output, an empty file is
written.

--html OUTPUT_FILE

Write HTML report to given file
(use - for stdout)

--html-dir
OUTPUT_DIR

Write multi-file HTML report to
given directory

--css URL

Link to an extra CSS for the
HTML report

--jquery URL

URL link to jQuery, for
--html and --html-dir output. If this is a
non-existent relative URL, diffoscope will create a symlink
to a system installation. (Paths searched:
/usr/share/javascript/jquery/jquery.js.) If not
given, --html output will not use JS but
--htmldir will if it can be found; give
"disable" to disable JS on all outputs.

--json OUTPUT_FILE

Write JSON text output to given
file (use - for stdout)

--markdown
OUTPUT_FILE

Write Markdown text output to
given file (use - for stdout)

--restructured-text
OUTPUT_FILE

Write RsT text output to given
file (use - for stdout)

--difftool TOOL

Compare differences one-by-one
using the specified external command similar to
git-difftool(1)

--profile
[OUTPUT_FILE]

Write profiling info to given
file (use - for stdout)

output
limits: 
--max-text-report-size BYTES

Maximum bytes written in
--text report. (0 to disable, default: 0)

--max-report-size
BYTES

Maximum bytes of a report in a
given format, across all of its pages. Note that some
formats, such as --html, may be restricted by even
smaller limits such as --max-page-size. (0 to
disable, default: 41943040)

--max-diff-block-lines
LINES

Maximum number of lines output
per unified-diff block, across all pages. (0 to disable,
default: 1024)

--max-page-size
BYTES

Maximum bytes of the top-level
(--html-dir) or sole (--html) page. (default:
41943040, remains in effect even with
--no-default-limits)

--max-page-diff-block-lines
LINES

Maximum number of lines output
per unified-diff block on the top-level (--html-dir)
or sole (--html) page, before spilling it into a
child page (--html-dir) or skipping the rest of the
diff block. (default: 128, remains in effect even with
--no-default-limits)

diff
calculation: 
--new-file

Treat absent files as empty

--exclude
GLOB_PATTERN

Exclude files whose names
(including any directory part) match GLOB_PATTERN. Use this
option to ignore files based on their names.

--exclude-command
REGEX_PATTERN

Exclude commands that match
REGEX_PATTERN. For example
’^readelf.*\s--debug-dump=info’ and
’^radare2.*’ can takea long time and differences
here are likely secondary differences caused by something
represented elsewhere. Use this option to disable commands
that use a lot of resources.

--exclude-directory-metadata
{auto,yes,no,recursive}

Exclude directory metadata.
Useful if comparing files whose filesystem-level metadata is
not intended to be distributed to other systems. This is
true for most distributions package builders, but not true
for the output of commands such as ’make
install’. Metadata of archive members remain
un-excluded except if "recursive" choice is set.
Use this option to ignore permissions, timestamps, xattrs
etc. Default: False if comparing two directories, else True.
Note that "file" metadata actually a property of
its containing directory, and is not relevant when
distributing the file across systems.

--diff-mask
REGEX_PATTERN

Replace/unify substrings that
match regular expression REGEX_PATTERN from output strings
before applying diff. For example, to filter out a version
number or changed path.

--fuzzy-threshold
FUZZY_THRESHOLD

Threshold for fuzzy-matching (0
to disable, 60 is default, 400 is high fuzziness)

--tool-prefix-binutils
PREFIX

Prefix for binutils program
names, e.g. "aarch64-linux-gnu-" for a
foreign-arch binary or "g" if you’re on a
non-GNU system.

--max-diff-input-lines
LINES

Maximum number of lines fed to
diff(1) (0 to disable, default: 4194304)

--max-container-depth
DEPTH

Maximum depth to recurse into
containers. (Cannot be disabled for security reasons,
default: 50)

--max-diff-block-lines-saved
LINES

Maximum number of lines saved
per diff block. Most users should not need this, unless you
run out of memory. This truncates diff(1) output before
emitting it in a report, and affects all types of output,
including --text and --json. (0 to disable,
default: 0)

--use-dbgsym WHEN

When to automatically use
corresponding -dbgsym packages when comparing .deb
files. WHEN is one of {no, auto, yes}. Default: auto,
meaning yes if two .changes or .buildinfo files are
specified, otherwise no.

--force-details

Force recursing into the depths
of file formats even if files have the same content, only
really useful for debugging diffoscope. Default: False

information
commands: 
--help, -h

Show this help and exit

number and exit

--list-tools

EXIT STATUS

Exit status is
0 if inputs are the same, 1 if different, 2 if trouble.

COMMAND-LINE EXAMPLES

To compare two
files in-depth and produce an HTML report, run something
like:

$ diffoscope --html output.html build1.changes build2.changes

diffoscope will
exit with 0 if there's no differences and 1 if there
are.

diffoscope
can also compare non-existent files:

$ diffoscope /nonexistent archive.zip

To get all
possible options, run:

$ diffoscope --help

If you have
enough RAM, you can improve performance by running:

$ TMPDIR=/run/shm diffoscope very-big-input-0/ very-big-input-1/

By default this
allowed to use up half of RAM; for more add something
like:

tmpfs   /run/shm    tmpfs   size=80%    0   0

to your
/etc/fstab; see man mount for details.

EXTERNAL DEPENDENCIES

diffoscope
requires Python 3 and the following modules available on
PyPI: libarchive-c, python-magic.

The various
comparators rely on external commands being available. To
get a list of them, please run:

$ diffoscope --list-tools
