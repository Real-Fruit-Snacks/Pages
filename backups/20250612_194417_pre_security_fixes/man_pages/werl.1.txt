NAME

werl âˆ’
The Erlang Emulator

DESCRIPTION

On Windows
95/NT, the preferred way to start the Erlang system is:

werl

This will start
Erlang in its own window, which is nice for interactive use
(command-line editing will work and there are scrollbars).
All flags except the -oldshell flag work as in
erl.

In cases there
you want to redirect standard input and/or standard output
or use Erlang in a pipeline, the werl is not
suitable, and the erl program should be used
instead.
