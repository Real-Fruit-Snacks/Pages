NAME

procinfo -
display system statistics gathered from /proc

SYNOPSIS

procinfo
[ -fdDSbrhv ] [ -nN ]

DESCRIPTION

procinfo
gathers some system data from the /proc directory and
prints it nicely formatted on the standard output
device.

The meanings of
the fields are as follows: 
Memory:

See the man page for
free(1)

Bootup:

The time the system was
booted.

Load average:

The average number of jobs
running, followed by the number of runnable processes and
the total number of processes, followed by the PID of the
last process run. The pid of the last running process will
probably always be procinfo’s PID.

user:

The amount of time spent running jobs in user space.

nice:

The amount of time spent running niced jobs in user
space. 

system:

The amount of time spent
running in kernel space. Note: the time spent
servicing interrupts is not counted by the kernel (and
nothing that procinfo can do about it).

idle:

The amount of time spent doing nothing.

uptime:

The time that the system has
been up. The above four should more or less add up to this
one.

page in:

The number of disk blocks paged
into core from disk. 1 block is equal to 1 kiB.

page out:

The number of disk blocks paged
out of core to disk. This includes regular disk-writes.

swap in:

The number of memory pages
paged in from swap.

swap out:

The number of memory pages
paged out to swap.

context:

The number of context switches,
either since bootup or per interval.

Disk stats(hda, hdb, sda, sdb):

The number of reads and writes
made to disks, whether CD-ROM, hard-drive, or USB. Shows all
disks if they either are an hdX or sdX, or if they have a
non-zero read/write count.

Interrupts:

Number of interrupts serviced
since boot, or per interval, listed per IRQ.

OPTIONS

-nN

Pause N second between updates.
This option implies -f. It may contain a decimal
point. The default is 5 seconds. When run by root with a
pause of 0 seconds, the program will run at the highest
possible priority level.

-d

For memory, CPU times, paging, swapping, disk, context
and interrupt stats, display values per second rather than
totals. This option implies -f.

-D

Same as -d, except that memory stats are
displayed as totals.

-S

When running with -d or -D, always show
values per second, even when running with -n N with
N greater than one second.

-b

Display numbers of bytes rather than number of I/O
requests. 

-r

This option adds an extra line to the memory info
showing ’real’ free memory, just as free(1)
does. The numbers produced assume that Buffers and Cache are
disposable. 

-H

Displays memory stats in ’Human’ (base 1024)
numbers (KiB, MiB, GiB), instead of implied KBytes.

-h

Print a brief help message.

-v

Print version info.

INTERACTIVE COMMANDS

When running
procinfo fullscreen, you can change its behaviour by
pressing d, D, S, r and b, which toggle the
flags that correspond to their same-named
commandline-options. In addition you can press q
which quits the program.

FILES

/proc

The proc file system.

BUGS

All of these
statistics are taken verbatim from the kernel, without any
scaling. Any case where the kernel specifies that a
particular field means something different from how it is
documented in this man-page, the kernel always wins.

Some features
of the original procinfo were elided, as they were
considered non-useful, especially as many of them
don’t change anymore, and have better utilities for
listing/displaying them.
