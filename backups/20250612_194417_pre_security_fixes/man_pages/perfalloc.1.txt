NAME

perfalloc
- notify pmdaperfevent(1) to disable hardware counter
allocation.

SYNOPSIS

$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/perfevent/perfalloc
[-D] [-d] [-f lockfile]
[-h] [-v] [COMMAND]

DESCRIPTION

perfalloc
is a command that notifies the pmdaperfevent(1) to
disable hardware counter event collection. This allow
unprivileged processes to use the hardware counters.

If the
reservation request fails, then perfalloc exits immediately
with exit code EXIT_FAILURE. If successful, the perfalloc
will run until a kill signal is received. The reservation
request persists while perfalloc is running.

Note that
pmdaperfevent is affected by the value of the
kernel.perf_event_paranoid setting, which can be
adjusted by sysctl(8).

If a
commandline is given, this is executed as a subprocess of
the agent. When the command dies, so does the agent.

A brief
description of the command line options follows:

-D

run in the foreground (the default)

-d

run in the background

-f FILE

use FILE as the lock file
(default $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/perfevent/perflock)

-h

display a help message and exit

-v

output version number and exit

BUGS

There may be a
delay of up to 100 miliseconds between perfalloc requesting
the hardware counter disabling and the perfevent PMDA
processing the request.

The perfalloc
process does not check the status of the request and
therefore is not able to provide a positive confirmation
that the request succeeded and the hardware counters are
disabled.
