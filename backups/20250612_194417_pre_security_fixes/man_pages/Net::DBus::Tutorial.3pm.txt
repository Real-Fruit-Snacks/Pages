NAME
       Net::DBus::Tutorial - tutorials on the Perl DBus APIs

DESCRIPTION
       This section includes tutorials on the Perl DBus APIs. Current topics
       include providing a service, by exporting objects to the bus, and
       accessing a service, by calling objects on the bus.

       Net::DBus::Tutorial::ExportingObjects
           This tutorial covers how to provide a service to the bus by
           exporting objects. The topics covered include basics of creating
           objects and methods, emitting signals, exporting properties,
           registering services for automatic activation.

       Net::DBus::Tutorial::UsingObjects
           This tutorial cover how to use a service provided on the bus by
           another application. The topics covered include the basics of
           calling methods on remote objects, explicitly calling methods in
           particular interfaces, listening for signals.

           NB This tutorial is yet to be written.
