NAME

virt-v2v-support
- Supported hypervisors, virtualization management systems
and guests in virt-v2v

DESCRIPTION

This page
documents which foreign hypervisors, virtualization
management systems and guest types that virt-v2v(1)
can support.

Note this page
applies to upstream virt-v2v from http://libguestfs.org and
in downstream distributions of virt-v2v sometimes features
are intentionally removed, or are present but not
supported.

Hypervisors
(Input) 
VMware ESXi

Must be managed by VMware
vCenter ≥ 5.0 unless VDDK is available.

OVA exported from VMware

OVAs from other hypervisors
will not work.

VMX from VMware

VMX files generated by other
hypervisors will not work.

RHEL 5 Xen 
SUSE Xen 
Citrix Xen

Citrix Xen has not been
recently tested.

Hyper-V

Not recently tested. Requires
that you export the disk or use virt-p2v(1) on
Hyper-V.

Direct from disk images

Only disk images exported from
supported hypervisors, and using container formats supported
by qemu.

Physical machines

Using the virt-p2v(1)
tool.

Hypervisors
(Output) 
QEMU and KVM only.

Virtualization
management systems (Output) 
OpenStack 
Red Hat Virtualization (RHV) 4.1 and up 
Local libvirt

And hence virsh(1),
virt-manager(1), and similar tools.

Local disk

Guests

Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, 6, 7 
CentOS 4, 5, 6, 7 
Scientific Linux 4, 5, 6, 7 
Oracle Linux 
Fedora 
SLES 10 and up 
OpenSUSE 10 and up 
ALT Linux 9 and up 
Debian 6 and up 
Ubuntu 10.04, 12.04, 14.04, 16.04, and up 
Windows XP to Windows 10 / Windows Server 2016

We use Windows internal version
numbers, see
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Microsoft_Windows_versions

Currently NT
5.2 to NT 6.3 are supported.

See
"WINDOWS" below for additional notes on converting
Windows guests.

Guest
firmware 
BIOS is supported for all guest types and hypervisors.

VMware allows
you to present UEFI firmware to guests (instead of the
ordinary PC BIOS). Virt-v2v can convert these guests, but
requires that UEFI is supported by the target
hypervisor.

Currently KVM
supports OVMF, an open source UEFI firmware, and can run
these guests.

Since OVMF
support was only recently added to KVM (in 2014/2015), not
all target environments support UEFI guests yet: 
UEFI on libvirt, qemu

Supported. Virt-v2v will
generate the correct libvirt XML (metadata) automatically,
but note that the same version of OVMF must be installed on
the conversion host as is installed on the target
hypervisor, else you will have to adjust paths in the
metadata.

UEFI on OpenStack

Supported since virt-v2v ≥
1.43.2.

UEFI on oVirt or RHV

Supported since oVirt/RHV ≥
4.2 and virt-v2v ≥ 1.39.12.
