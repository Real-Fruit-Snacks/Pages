NAME

nbd_set_debug -
set or clear the debug flag

SYNOPSIS

#include

int nbd_set_debug ( 
struct nbd_handle *h, bool debug 
);

DESCRIPTION

Set or clear
the debug flag. When debugging is enabled, debugging
messages from the library are printed to stderr, unless a
debugging callback has been defined too (see
nbd_set_debug_callback(3)) in which case they are
sent to that function. This flag defaults to false on newly
created handles, except if "LIBNBD_DEBUG=1" is set
in the environment in which case it defaults to true.

RETURN VALUE

If the call is
successful the function returns 0.

ERRORS

On error -1 is
returned.

Refer to
"ERROR HANDLING" in libnbd(3) for how to
get further details of the error.

The following
parameters must not be NULL: "h". For more
information see "Non-NULL parameters" in
libnbd(3).

VERSION

This function
first appeared in libnbd 1.0.

If you need to
test if this function is available at compile time check if
the following macro is defined:
