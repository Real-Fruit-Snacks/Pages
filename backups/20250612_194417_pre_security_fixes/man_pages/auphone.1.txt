NAME

auphone - a
simple telephone client

SYNOPSIS

auphone
[-a servername] [-v volume]
[-l latency] [-r filename]

DESCRIPTION

auphone
allows two-way real time voice communication between two
audio servers.

OPTIONS

The following
options can be used with auphone: 
-a servername

This option specifies the audio
server to which auphone should connect.

-v volume

This is the volume, in percent,
for the incoming ring sound. The default is 15 percent.

-l latency

This is the latency, in
seconds, of the auphone connection. A lower value will
result in better real-time communications at the expense of
possibly overloading the server (causing dropouts) and a
greater network duty cycle. A higher value will lessen the
load on the server and decrease the network duty cycle but
will increase the communications delay. The default value is
.25 seconds.

-r filename

You can personalize your
incoming ringing sound using the -r option. Simply
specify the filename of an audio file to use for the
incoming ring sound. Note that this sound will be
looped.

USAGE

To place a
call, enter the address of the audio server that you wish to
connect with in the Who text field. Then hit RETURN
or click on the Call button. If the callee is
accepting calls, you should hear a ringing sound. If the
callee answers, the username and server address of the
callee will be displayed. To disconnect, click on the
Hangup button.

To receive
incoming calls, you must already be running auphone.
To answer an incoming call, click on the Answer
button. You may also determine who’s calling before
you answer by clicking on the Caller ID button.

Once
you’re connected, the Volume slider controls
the volume of the speaker output and the Input Gain
slider and Input Mode toggle control the gain and
mode of the microphone or line input.

AUPHONE AND THE ATHENA WIDGET SET

auphone
uses the X Toolkit Intrinsics and the Athena Widget Set. For
more information, see the Athena Widget Set
documentation.

ENVIRONMENT

In addition to
the standard toolkit environment variables, the following
environment variables are used by auphone: 
AUDIOSERVER

This variable specifies the
default audio server to contact if -a is not
specified on the command line. If this variable is not set
and the -a is not specified on the command line,
auphone will attempt to connect to the audio server
running on the X Window System display.
