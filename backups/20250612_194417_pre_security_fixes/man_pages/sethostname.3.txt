DESCRIPTION

The gethostname()
function returns the standard host name for the current
processor, as previously set by sethostname(). The

machine to be name, which has length namelen.
This call is restricted to the super-user and is normally
used only when the system is bootstrapped.

value 0 is returned; otherwise the value −1
is returned and the global variable errno is set to
indicate the error.

ERRORS

The following errors may be
returned by these calls:

[EFAULT]

or namelen argument gave an invalid address.

[EPERM]

The caller
tried to set the hostname and was not the super-user.
