TX(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual TX(4)

NAME

tx — SMC 83c17x
Fast Ethernet device driver

SYNOPSIS

To compile this driver into the
kernel, place the following lines in your kernel
configuration file:

device
miibus 
device tx

Alternatively,
to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following line in loader.conf(5):

if_tx_load="YES"

DEPRECATION NOTICE

The tx driver is not
present in FreeBSD 13.0 and later. See
https://github.com/freebsd/fcp/blob/master/fcp-0101.md for
more information.

DESCRIPTION

The tx driver provides
support for the Ethernet adapters based on the SMC 83c17x
(EPIC) chips. These are mostly SMC 9432 series cards.

The tx
driver supports the following media types (depending on
card’s capabilities):

autoselect

Enable
autonegotiation (default).

100baseFX

Set 100Mbps
(Fast Ethernet) fiber optic operation.

100baseTX

Set 100Mbps
(Fast Ethernet) twisted pair operation.

10baseT/UTP

Set 10Mbps on
10baseT port.

10base2/BNC

Set 10Mbps on
10base2 port.

The tx
driver supports the following media options:

full-duplex

Set full-duplex
operation.

The tx
driver supports oversized Ethernet packets (up to 1600
bytes). Refer to the ifconfig(8) man page on setting the
interface’s MTU.

The old
’’ifconfig tx0 linkN’’ method of
configuration is not supported.

VLAN (IEEE
802.1Q) support 
The tx driver supports the VLAN operation (using
vlan(4) interfaces) without decreasing the MTU on the
vlan(4) interfaces.

DIAGNOSTICS

tx%d: device timeout %d
packets  The device stops responding. Device and
driver reset follows this error.

tx%d: PCI
fatal error occurred (%s)  One of following errors
occurred: PCI Target Abort, PCI Master Abort, Data Parity
Error or Address Parity Error. Device and driver reset
follows this error.

tx%d: cannot
allocate mbuf header/cluster  Cannot allocate
memory for received packet. Packet thrown away.

tx%d:
can’t stop %s DMA  While resetting, the
driver failed to stop the device correctly.

BUGS

The auto-negotiation does not
work very well.
