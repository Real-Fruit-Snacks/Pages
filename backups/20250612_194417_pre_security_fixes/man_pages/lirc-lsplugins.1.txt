[drivers]

lirc-lsplugins
-e [-q] [-U plugindir]

lirc-lsplugins
-y [-U plugindir]

DESCRIPTION

Tool which
writes a simple list with info for each driver found. In
particular, it writes info if a plugin can’t be loaded
e. g., due to unresolved references.

The
drivers argument is an optional selector which limits
the output to matching drivers. The match is a glob-type
match as done by fnmatch()

OPTIONS

-U
--plugindir path>

Use  to search for
plugins. The path is a’:’-separated search path
similar to e. g., $PATH.

-q --quiet

Don’t write headers and
trailing legend.

-s --summary

Just write a summary over
number of plugins, drivers and errors.

-e --errors

Only list plugins which
can’t be loaded, or does not contain any drivers.

-y --yaml

Make a YAML listing reflecting
the drivers’ configuration hints such as the
device_hint. The format is unstable and primarely used by
lirc-setup(1).

-l --long

Add info on driver
features.

-p --default-path

Print default search path and
exit.

-h --help

Display usage summary.

-v --version

Display version info.

EXAMPLES

$ lirc-lsplugins -U
../lib/.libs:/usr/local/lib/lirc/plugins tira*

Lists all
drivers with name matching ’tira*’ found in
plugins living in ../lib/.libs or
/usr/local/lib/lirc/plugins.

RETURN VALUE

lirc-lsplugins
returns a non-zero error code if there is at least one
plugin from which no driver can be loaded or options and
parameters can’t be parsed. Otherwise it returns
zero.

BUGS

Some drivers
change their capabilities in runtime after inspecting the
underlying hardware. These runtime capabilities can not be
listed by lirc-lsplugins.
