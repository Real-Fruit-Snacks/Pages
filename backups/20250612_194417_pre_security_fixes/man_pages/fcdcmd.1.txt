NAME

fcdcmd, fcd
− change client’s current working directory in
the FSP database

SYNOPSIS

fcdcmd
path

fcd
path

DESCRIPTION

If no paths are
given, / is used as the current working directory. If
path begins with a /, fcdcmd uses it as the
current working directory. Otherwise, fcdcmd appends
path to the end of the current working directory. In
both cases, fcdcmd simplifies the new path and writes
it to the stdout. In order for the effect of
fcdcmd to be felt in subsequent FSP transactions,
user needs to save the stdout output in the
FSP_DIR variable. If the change is successful,
fcdcmd will display the protection setting of the new
working directory.

fcdcmd
will perform csh file name globbing based on file and
directory information obtained from the FSP database.

Since
user’s command shells generally cannot do the proper
globbing for this program, it is recommended that user
defines a shell alias or function to turn off command shell
globbing before running this program. csh
example:

alias fcd
setenv FSP_DIR \’\(set noglob\; exec fcdcmd
\!\*\)\’

ENVIRONMENT

See fsp_env(7)
for list of used environment variables.

BUGS

If more than
one path is given, only the first one will be used.
The rest will be silently ignored.
