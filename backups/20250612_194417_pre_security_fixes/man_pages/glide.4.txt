DESCRIPTION

glide is
an Xorg driver for Glide capable video boards (such as 3Dfx
Voodoo boards). This driver is mainly for Voodoo 1 and
Voodoo 2 boards, later boards from 3Dfx have 2D built-in and
you should preferably use a driver separate for those boards
or the fbdev(4) driver. This driver is a bit special because
Voodoo 1 and 2 boards are very much NOT made for running 2D
graphics. Therefore, this driver uses no hardware
acceleration (since there is no acceleration for 2D, only
3D). Instead it is implemented with the help of a
"shadow" framebuffer that resides entirely in RAM.
Selected portions of this shadow framebuffer are then copied
out to the Voodoo board at the right time. Because of this,
the speed of the driver is very dependent on the CPU. But
since the CPU is nowadays actually rather fast at moving
data, we get very good speed anyway, especially since the
whole shadow framebuffer is in cached RAM.

This driver
supports 16 and 24 bit color modes. The 24 bit color mode
uses a 32 bit framebuffer (it has no support for 24 bit
packed-pixel framebuffers). Notice that the Voodoo boards
can only display 16 bit color, but the shadow framebuffer
can be run in 24 bit color. The point of supporting 24 bit
mode is that this enables you to run in a multihead
configuration with Xinerama together with another board that
runs in real 24 bit color mode. (All boards must run the
same color depth when you use Xinerama).

Resolutions
supported are: 640x480, 800x600, 960x720, 1024x768,
1280x1024 and 1600x1200. Note that not all modes will work
on all Voodoo boards. It seems that Voodoo 2 boards support
no higher than 1024x768 and Voodoo 1 boards can go to
800x600. If you see a message like this in the output from
the server:

(EE) GLIDE(0):
grSstWinOpen returned ...

Then you are
probably trying to use a resolution that is supported by the
driver but not supported by the hardware.

Refresh rates
supported are: 60Hz, 75Hz and 85Hz. The refresh rate used is
derived from the normal mode line according to the following
table:

Mode-line refresh rate

Used refresh rate

0-74 Hz

60 Hz

74-84 Hz

75 Hz

84- Hz

85 Hz

Thus, if you
use a modeline that for example has a 70Hz refresh rate you
will only get a 60Hz refresh rate in actuality.

Selecting which
Voodoo board to use with the driver is done by using an
option called "GlideDevice" in the
"Device" section. (If you don’t have this
option present then the first board found will be selected
for that Device section). For example: To use the first
Voodoo board, use a "Device" section like this,
for example:

Section
"Device" 
Identifier "Voodoo" 
Driver "glide" 
Option "dpms" "on" 
Option "GlideDevice" "0" 
EndSection

And if you have
more than one Voodoo board, add another "Device"
section with a GlideDevice option with value 1, and so on.
(You can use more than one Voodoo board, but SLI configured
boards will be treated as a single board.)

Multihead and
Xinerama configurations are supported.

Limited support
for DPMS screen saving is available. The "standby"
and "suspend" modes are just painting the screen
black. The "off" mode turns the Voodoo board off
and thus works correctly.

This driver
does not support a virtual screen size different from the
display size.

SUPPORTED HARDWARE

The
glide driver supports any board that can be used with
Glide (such as 3Dfx Voodoo boards)

CONFIGURATION DETAILS

Please refer to
xorg.conf(5) for general configuration details. This section
only covers configuration details specific to this
driver.

The following
driver Options are supported: 
Option "OnAtExit"
"boolean"

If true, will leave the Voodoo
board on when the server exits. Useful in a multihead setup
when only the Voodoo board is connected to a second monitor
and you don’t want that monitor to lose signal when
you quit the server. Put this option in the Device section.
Default: off.

Option
"GlideDevice"
"integer"

Selects which Voodoo board to
use. (Or boards, in an SLI configuration). The value should
be 0 for the first board, 1 for the second and so on. If it
is not present, the first Voodoo board found will be
selected. Put this option in the Device section.

EXAMPLE

Here is an
example of a part of an xorg.conf file that uses a multihead
configuration with two monitors. The first monitor is driven
by the fbdev video driver and the second monitor is driven
by the glide driver.

Section
"Monitor" 
Identifier "Monitor 1" 
VendorName "Unknown" 
ModelName "Unknown" 
HorizSync 30-70 
VertRefresh 50-80

# 1024x768 @ 76
Hz, 62.5 kHz hsync 
Modeline "1024x768" 85 1024 1032 1152 1360 768 784

EndSection

Section
"Monitor" 
Identifier "Monitor 2" 
VendorName "Unknown" 
ModelName "Unknown" 
HorizSync 30-70 
VertRefresh 50-80

# 1024x768 @ 76
Hz, 62.5 kHz hsync 
Modeline "1024x768" 85 1024 1032 1152 1360 768 784
787 823 
EndSection

Section
"Device" 
Identifier "fb" 
Driver "fbdev" 
Option "shadowfb" 
Option "dpms" "on" 
# My video card is on the AGP bus which is usually 
# located as PCI bus 1, device 0, function 0. 
BusID "PCI:1:0:0" 
EndSection

Section
"Device" 
# I have a Voodoo 2 board 
Identifier "Voodoo" 
Driver "glide" 
Option "dpms" "on" 
# The next line says I want to use the first board. 
Option "GlideDevice" "0" 
EndSection

Section
"Screen" 
Identifier "Screen 1" 
Device "fb" 
Monitor "Monitor 1" 
DefaultDepth 16 
Subsection "Display" 
Depth 16 
Modes "1024x768" 
EndSubSection 
EndSection

Section
"Screen" 
Identifier "Screen 2" 
Device "Voodoo" 
Monitor "Monitor 2" 
DefaultDepth 16 
Subsection "Display" 
Depth 16 
Modes "1024x768" 
EndSubSection 
EndSection

Section
"ServerLayout" 
Identifier "Main Layout" 
# Screen 1 is to the right and screen 2 is to the left 
Screen "Screen 2" 
Screen "Screen 1" "" ""
"Screen 2" "" 
EndSection

If you use this
configuration file and start the server with the +xinerama
command line option, the two monitors will be showing a
single large area where windows can be moved between
monitors and overlap from one monitor to the other. Starting
the X server with the Xinerama extension can be done for
example like this:

$ xinit --
+xinerama
