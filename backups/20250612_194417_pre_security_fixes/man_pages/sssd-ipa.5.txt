NAME

sssd-ipa - SSSD
IPA provider

DESCRIPTION

This manual
page describes the configuration of the IPA provider for
sssd(8). For a detailed syntax reference, refer to
the “FILE FORMAT” section of the
sssd.conf(5) manual page.

The IPA
provider is a back end used to connect to an IPA server.
(Refer to the freeipa.org web site for information about IPA
servers.) This provider requires that the machine be joined
to the IPA domain; configuration is almost entirely
self-discovered and obtained directly from the server.

The IPA
provider enables SSSD to use the sssd-ldap(5)
identity provider and the sssd-krb5(5) authentication
provider with optimizations for IPA environments. The IPA
provider accepts the same options used by the sssd-ldap and
sssd-krb5 providers with some exceptions. However, it is
neither necessary nor recommended to set these options.

The IPA
provider primarily copies the traditional ldap and krb5
provider default options with some exceptions, the
differences are listed in the “MODIFIED DEFAULT
OPTIONS” section.

As an access
provider, the IPA provider has a minimal configuration (see
“ipa_access_order”) as it mainly uses HBAC
(host-based access control) rules. Please refer to
freeipa.org for more information about HBAC.

If
“auth_provider=ipa” or
“access_provider=ipa” is configured in sssd.conf
then the id_provider must also be set to
“ipa”.

The IPA
provider will use the PAC responder if the Kerberos tickets
of users from trusted realms contain a PAC. To make
configuration easier the PAC responder is started
automatically if the IPA ID provider is configured.

CONFIGURATION OPTIONS

Refer to the
section “DOMAIN SECTIONS” of the
sssd.conf(5) manual page for details on the
configuration of an SSSD domain.

ipa_domain
(string)

Specifies the name of the IPA
domain. This is optional. If not provided, the configuration
domain name is used.

ipa_server,
ipa_backup_server (string)

The comma-separated list of IP
addresses or hostnames of the IPA servers to which SSSD
should connect in the order of preference. For more
information on failover and server redundancy, see the
“FAILOVER” section. This is optional if
autodiscovery is enabled. For more information on service
discovery, refer to the “SERVICE DISCOVERY”
section.

ipa_hostname
(string)

Optional. May be set on
machines where the hostname(5) does not reflect the fully
qualified name used in the IPA domain to identify this host.
The hostname must be fully qualified.

dyndns_update
(boolean)

Optional. This option tells
SSSD to automatically update the DNS server built into
FreeIPA with the IP address of this client. The update is
secured using GSS-TSIG. The IP address of the IPA LDAP
connection is used for the updates, if it is not otherwise
specified by using the “dyndns_iface”
option.

NOTE: On older
systems (such as RHEL 5), for this behavior to work
reliably, the default Kerberos realm must be set properly in
/etc/krb5.conf

NOTE: While it
is still possible to use the old ipa_dyndns_update
option, users should migrate to using dyndns_update
in their config file.

Default:
false

dyndns_ttl
(integer)

The TTL to apply to the client
DNS record when updating it. If dyndns_update is false this
has no effect. This will override the TTL serverside if set
by an administrator.

NOTE: While it
is still possible to use the old ipa_dyndns_ttl
option, users should migrate to using dyndns_ttl in
their config file.

Default: 1200
(seconds)

dyndns_iface
(string)

Optional. Applicable only when
dyndns_update is true. Choose the interface or a list of
interfaces whose IP addresses should be used for dynamic DNS
updates. Special value “*” implies that IPs from
all interfaces should be used.

NOTE: While it
is still possible to use the old ipa_dyndns_iface
option, users should migrate to using dyndns_iface in
their config file.

Default: Use
the IP addresses of the interface which is used for IPA LDAP
connection

Example:
dyndns_iface = em1, vnet1, vnet2

dyndns_auth
(string)

Whether the nsupdate utility
should use GSS-TSIG authentication for secure updates with
the DNS server, insecure updates can be sent by setting this
option to 'none'.

Default:
GSS-TSIG

dyndns_auth_ptr
(string)

Whether the nsupdate utility
should use GSS-TSIG authentication for secure PTR updates
with the DNS server, insecure updates can be sent by setting
this option to 'none'.

Default: Same
as dyndns_auth

ipa_enable_dns_sites
(boolean)

Enables DNS sites - location
based service discovery.

If true and
service discovery (see Service Discovery paragraph at the
bottom of the man page) is enabled, then the SSSD will first
attempt location based discovery using a query that contains
"_location.hostname.example.com" and then fall
back to traditional SRV discovery. If the location based
discovery succeeds, the IPA servers located with the
location based discovery are treated as primary servers and
the IPA servers located using the traditional SRV discovery
are used as back up servers

Default:
false

dyndns_refresh_interval
(integer)

How often should the back end
perform periodic DNS update in addition to the automatic
update performed when the back end goes online. This option
is optional and applicable only when dyndns_update is
true.

Default: 0
(disabled)

dyndns_update_ptr
(bool)

Whether the PTR record should
also be explicitly updated when updating the client's DNS
records. Applicable only when dyndns_update is true.

This option
should be False in most IPA deployments as the IPA server
generates the PTR records automatically when forward records
are changed.

Note that
dyndns_update_per_family parameter does not apply for
PTR record updates. Those updates are always sent
separately.

Default: False
(disabled)

dyndns_force_tcp
(bool)

Whether the nsupdate utility
should default to using TCP for communicating with the DNS
server.

Default: False
(let nsupdate choose the protocol)

dyndns_server
(string)

The DNS server to use when
performing a DNS update. In most setups, it's recommended to
leave this option unset.

Setting this
option makes sense for environments where the DNS server is
different from the identity server.

Please note
that this option will be only used in fallback attempt when
previous attempt using autodetected settings failed.

Default: None
(let nsupdate choose the server)

dyndns_update_per_family
(boolean)

DNS update is by default
performed in two steps - IPv4 update and then IPv6 update.
In some cases it might be desirable to perform IPv4 and IPv6
update in single step.

Default:
true

ipa_access_order
(string)

Comma separated list of access
control options. Allowed values are:

expire:
use IPA's account expiration policy.

pwd_expire_policy_reject,
pwd_expire_policy_warn, pwd_expire_policy_renew: These
options are useful if users are interested in being warned
that password is about to expire and authentication is based
on using a different method than passwords - for example SSH
keys.

The difference
between these options is the action taken if user password
is expired:

•
pwd_expire_policy_reject - user is denied to log in,

•
pwd_expire_policy_warn - user is still able to log in,

•
pwd_expire_policy_renew - user is prompted to change their
password immediately.

Please note
that 'access_provider = ipa' must be set for this feature to
work.

ipa_deskprofile_search_base
(string)

Optional. Use the given string
as search base for Desktop Profile related objects.

Default: Use
base DN

ipa_hbac_search_base
(string)

Optional. Use the given string
as search base for HBAC related objects.

Default: Use
base DN

ipa_host_search_base
(string)

Deprecated. Use
ldap_host_search_base instead.

ipa_selinux_search_base
(string)

Optional. Use the given string
as search base for SELinux user maps.

See
“ldap_search_base” for information about
configuring multiple search bases.

Default: the
value of ldap_search_base

ipa_subdomains_search_base
(string)

Optional. Use the given string
as search base for trusted domains.

See
“ldap_search_base” for information about
configuring multiple search bases.

Default: the
value of cn=trusts,%basedn

ipa_master_domain_search_base
(string)

Optional. Use the given string
as search base for master domain object.

See
“ldap_search_base” for information about
configuring multiple search bases.

Default: the
value of cn=ad,cn=etc,%basedn

ipa_views_search_base
(string)

Optional. Use the given string
as search base for views containers.

See
“ldap_search_base” for information about
configuring multiple search bases.

Default: the
value of cn=views,cn=accounts,%basedn

krb5_realm
(string)

The name of the Kerberos realm.
This is optional and defaults to the value of
“ipa_domain”.

The name of the
Kerberos realm has a special meaning in IPA - it is
converted into the base DN to use for performing LDAP
operations.

krb5_confd_path
(string)

Absolute path of a directory
where SSSD should place Kerberos configuration snippets.

To disable the
creation of the configuration snippets set the parameter to
'none'.

Default: not
set (krb5.include.d subdirectory of SSSD's pubconf
directory)

ipa_deskprofile_refresh
(integer)

The amount of time between
lookups of the Desktop Profile rules against the IPA server.
This will reduce the latency and load on the IPA server if
there are many desktop profiles requests made in a short
period.

Default: 5
(seconds)

ipa_deskprofile_request_interval
(integer)

The amount of time between
lookups of the Desktop Profile rules against the IPA server
in case the last request did not return any rule.

Default: 60
(minutes)

ipa_hbac_refresh
(integer)

The amount of time between
lookups of the HBAC rules against the IPA server. This will
reduce the latency and load on the IPA server if there are
many access-control requests made in a short period.

Default: 5
(seconds)

ipa_hbac_selinux
(integer)

The amount of time between
lookups of the SELinux maps against the IPA server. This
will reduce the latency and load on the IPA server if there
are many user login requests made in a short period.

Default: 5
(seconds)

ipa_server_mode
(boolean)

This option will be set by the
IPA installer (ipa-server-install) automatically and denotes
if SSSD is running on an IPA server or not.

On an IPA
server SSSD will lookup users and groups from trusted
domains directly while on a client it will ask an IPA
server.

NOTE: There are
currently some assumptions that must be met when SSSD is
running on an IPA server.

• The
“ipa_server” option must be configured to point
to the IPA server itself. This is already the default set by
the IPA installer, so no manual change is required.

• The
“full_name_format” option must not be tweaked to
only print short names for users from trusted domains.

Default:
false

ipa_automount_location
(string)

The automounter location this
IPA client will be using

Default: The
location named "default"

Please note
that the automounter only reads the master map on startup,
so if any autofs-related changes are made to the sssd.conf,
you typically also need to restart the automounter daemon
after restarting the SSSD.

VIEWS AND
OVERRIDES 
SSSD can handle views and overrides which are offered by
FreeIPA 4.1 and later version. Since all paths and
objectclasses are fixed on the server side there is
basically no need to configure anything. For completeness
the related options are listed here with their default
values.

ipa_view_class
(string)

Objectclass of the view
container.

Default:
nsContainer

ipa_view_name
(string)

Name of the attribute holding
the name of the view.

Default: cn

ipa_override_object_class
(string)

Objectclass of the override
objects.

Default:
ipaOverrideAnchor

ipa_anchor_uuid
(string)

Name of the attribute
containing the reference to the original object in a remote
domain.

Default:
ipaAnchorUUID

ipa_user_override_object_class
(string)

Name of the objectclass for
user overrides. It is used to determine if the found
override object is related to a user or a group.

User overrides
can contain attributes given by

•
ldap_user_name

•
ldap_user_uid_number

•
ldap_user_gid_number

•
ldap_user_gecos

•
ldap_user_home_directory

•
ldap_user_shell

•
ldap_user_ssh_public_key

Default:
ipaUserOverride

ipa_group_override_object_class
(string)

Name of the objectclass for
group overrides. It is used to determine if the found
override object is related to a user or a group.

Group overrides
can contain attributes given by

•
ldap_group_name

•
ldap_group_gid_number

Default:
ipaGroupOverride

MODIFIED DEFAULT OPTIONS

Certain option
defaults do not match their respective backend provider
defaults, these option names and IPA provider-specific
defaults are listed below:

KRB5
Provider

• krb5_validate = true

•
krb5_use_fast = try

•
krb5_canonicalize = true

LDAP
Provider - General

• ldap_schema = ipa_v1

•
ldap_force_upper_case_realm = true

•
ldap_sasl_mech = GSSAPI

•
ldap_sasl_minssf = 56

•
ldap_account_expire_policy = ipa

•
ldap_use_tokengroups = true

LDAP
Provider - User options

• ldap_user_member_of =
memberOf

•
ldap_user_uuid = ipaUniqueID

•
ldap_user_ssh_public_key = ipaSshPubKey

•
ldap_user_auth_type = ipaUserAuthType

LDAP
Provider - Group options

• ldap_group_object_class
= ipaUserGroup

•
ldap_group_object_class_alt = posixGroup

•
ldap_group_member = member

•
ldap_group_uuid = ipaUniqueID

•
ldap_group_objectsid = ipaNTSecurityIdentifier

•
ldap_group_external_member = ipaExternalMember

SUBDOMAINS PROVIDER

The IPA
subdomains provider behaves slightly differently if it is
configured explicitly or implicitly.

If the option
'subdomains_provider = ipa' is found in the domain section
of sssd.conf, the IPA subdomains provider is configured
explicitly, and all subdomain requests are sent to the IPA
server if necessary.

If the option
'subdomains_provider' is not set in the domain section of
sssd.conf but there is the option 'id_provider = ipa', the
IPA subdomains provider is configured implicitly. In this
case, if a subdomain request fails and indicates that the
server does not support subdomains, i.e. is not configured
for trusts, the IPA subdomains provider is disabled. After
an hour or after the IPA provider goes online, the
subdomains provider is enabled again.

TRUSTED DOMAINS CONFIGURATION

Some
configuration options can also be set for a trusted domain.
A trusted domain configuration can be set using the trusted
domain subsection as shown in the example below.
Alternatively, the “subdomain_inherit” option
can be used in the parent domain.

[domain/ipa.domain.com/ad.domain.com]

ad_server = dc.ad.domain.com

For more
details, see the sssd.conf(5) manual page.

Different
configuration options are tunable for a trusted domain
depending on whether you are configuring SSSD on an IPA
server or an IPA client.

OPTIONS
TUNABLE ON IPA MASTERS 
The following options can be set in a subdomain section on
an IPA master:

•
ad_server

•
ad_backup_server

•
ad_site

•
ldap_search_base

•
ldap_user_search_base

•
ldap_group_search_base

•
use_fully_qualified_names

OPTIONS
TUNABLE ON IPA CLIENTS 
The following options can be set in a subdomain section on
an IPA client:

•
ad_server

•
ad_site

Note that if
both options are set, only “ad_server” is
evaluated.

Since any
request for a user or a group identity from a trusted domain
triggered from an IPA client is resolved by the IPA server,
the “ad_server” and “ad_site”
options only affect which AD DC will the authentication be
performed against. In particular, the addresses resolved
from these lists will be written to “kdcinfo”
files read by the Kerberos locator plugin. Please refer to
the sssd_krb5_locator_plugin(8) manual page for more
details on the Kerberos locator plugin.

FAILOVER

The failover
feature allows back ends to automatically switch to a
different server if the current server fails.

Failover
Syntax 
The list of servers is given as a comma-separated list; any
number of spaces is allowed around the comma. The servers
are listed in order of preference. The list can contain any
number of servers.

For each
failover-enabled config option, two variants exist:
primary and backup. The idea is that servers
in the primary list are preferred and backup servers are
only searched if no primary servers can be reached. If a
backup server is selected, a timeout of 31 seconds is set.
After this timeout SSSD will periodically try to reconnect
to one of the primary servers. If it succeeds, it will
replace the current active (backup) server.

The Failover
Mechanism 
The failover mechanism distinguishes between a machine and a
service. The back end first tries to resolve the hostname of
a given machine; if this resolution attempt fails, the
machine is considered offline. No further attempts are made
to connect to this machine for any other service. If the
resolution attempt succeeds, the back end tries to connect
to a service on this machine. If the service connection
attempt fails, then only this particular service is
considered offline and the back end automatically switches
over to the next service. The machine is still considered
online and might still be tried for another service.

Further
connection attempts are made to machines or services marked
as offline after a specified period of time; this is
currently hard coded to 30 seconds.

If there are no
more machines to try, the back end as a whole switches to
offline mode, and then attempts to reconnect every 30
seconds.

Failover
time outs and tuning 
Resolving a server to connect to can be as simple as running
a single DNS query or can involve several steps, such as
finding the correct site or trying out multiple host names
in case some of the configured servers are not reachable.
The more complex scenarios can take some time and SSSD needs
to balance between providing enough time to finish the
resolution process but on the other hand, not trying for too
long before falling back to offline mode. If the SSSD debug
logs show that the server resolution is timing out before a
live server is contacted, you can consider changing the time
outs.

This section
lists the available tunables. Please refer to their
description in the sssd.conf(5), manual page.

dns_resolver_server_timeout

Time in milliseconds that sets
how long would SSSD talk to a single DNS server before
trying next one.

Default:
1000

dns_resolver_op_timeout

Time in seconds to tell how
long would SSSD try to resolve single DNS query (e.g.
resolution of a hostname or an SRV record) before trying the
next hostname or discovery domain.

Default: 3

dns_resolver_timeout

How long would SSSD try to
resolve a failover service. This service resolution
internally might include several steps, such as resolving
DNS SRV queries or locating the site.

Default: 6

For LDAP-based
providers, the resolve operation is performed as part of an
LDAP connection operation. Therefore, also the
“ldap_opt_timeout” timeout should be set to a
larger value than “dns_resolver_timeout” which
in turn should be set to a larger value than
“dns_resolver_op_timeout” which should be larger
than “dns_resolver_server_timeout”.

SERVICE DISCOVERY

The service
discovery feature allows back ends to automatically find the
appropriate servers to connect to using a special DNS query.
This feature is not supported for backup servers.

Configuration

If no servers are specified, the back end automatically uses
service discovery to try to find a server. Optionally, the
user may choose to use both fixed server addresses and
service discovery by inserting a special keyword,
“_srv_”, in the list of servers. The order of
preference is maintained. This feature is useful if, for
example, the user prefers to use service discovery whenever
possible, and fall back to a specific server when no servers
can be discovered using DNS.

The domain
name 
Please refer to the “dns_discovery_domain”
parameter in the sssd.conf(5) manual page for more
details.

The
protocol 
The queries usually specify _tcp as the protocol. Exceptions
are documented in respective option description.

For more information on the service discovery mechanism,
refer to RFC 2782.

EXAMPLE

The following
example assumes that SSSD is correctly configured and
example.com is one of the domains in the [sssd]
section. This examples shows only the ipa provider-specific
options.

[domain/example.com]

id_provider = ipa 
ipa_server = ipaserver.example.com 
ipa_hostname = myhost.example.com
