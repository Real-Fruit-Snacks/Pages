NAME

ispcvt — verify if
current video driver is pcvt driver

SYNOPSIS

ispcvt [−c]
[−d device] [−n]
[−v]

DESCRIPTION

The ispcvt utility allows
the user to check whether the current video driver compiled
into the kernel is a pcvt driver. The major and minor
release numbers of the driver are also checked. Furthermore
ispcvt is also able to print out the values of all
the ’’PCVT_XXXXXX’’ compile
time options, the driver in the current running kernel was
compiled with.

The options are
as follows:

−d

Specifies a
device for which the check is done.

−v

Specifies being
verbose. On success the name and revision is reported, on
failure which comparison failed.

−n

print the
number of compiled-in virtual terminals.

−c

This options
prints out the values of all
’’PCVT_XXXXXX’’ #defines
which were given to the compiler at the time the currently
running kernel was compiled. Specifying −v with
the −c option gives a verbose listing of the
compile-time options.

DIAGNOSTICS

The ispcvt utility exits
with one of the following values:

0

driver is pcvt
and major and minor numbers match

1

open(2) or
ioctl(2) system call failed

2

driver name
mismatch

3

name matched,
release major number mismatch

4

name and major
number matched, release minor number mismatch

5
