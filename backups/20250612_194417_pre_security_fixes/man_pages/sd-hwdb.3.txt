NAME

sd-hwdb -
Read-only access to the hardware description database

SYNOPSIS

#include

pkg-config --cflags --libs
libsystemd 

DESCRIPTION

sd-hwdb.h is
part of libsystemd(3) and allows read-only access the
systemd database of hardware properties. See hwdb(7)
and systemd-hwdb(8) for more information about the
database.

See
sd_hwdb_new(3) and sd_hwdb_get(3) for
information about the functions available.

NOTES

Functions
described here are available as a shared library, which can
be compiled against and linked to with the
libsystemd pkg-config(1) file.

The code
described here uses getenv(3), which is declared to
be not multi-thread-safe. This means that the code calling
the functions described here must not call setenv(3)
from a parallel thread. It is recommended to only do calls
to setenv() from an early phase of the program when
no other threads have been started.
