NAME
       Font::TTF::Cvt_ - Control Value Table in a TrueType font

DESCRIPTION
       This is a minimal class adding nothing beyond a table, but is a
       repository for cvt type information for those processes brave enough to
       address hinting.

INSTANCE VARIABLES
       val This is an array of CVT values. Thus access to the CVT is via:

               $f->{'cvt_'}{'val'}[$num];

METHODS
   $t->read
       Reads the CVT table into both the tables ' dat' variable and the "val"
       array.

   $t->update
       Updates the RAM file copy ' dat' to be the same as the array.

BUGS
       None known
