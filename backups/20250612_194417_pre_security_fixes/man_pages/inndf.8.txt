NAME

inndf - Report
free disk, inodes, and overview information

SYNOPSIS

inndf
[-Fhi] [-f filename] directory
[directory ...]

inndf
-n

inndf
-o

DESCRIPTION

inndf
was originally a replacement for "df | awk" in
innwatch.ctl(5) and innstat(8), and now also reports various
other usage information about INN’s storage that df(1)
doesn’t understand. inndf doesn’t sync,
forks less, and is generally less complicated than
df(1).

Its default
behavior is to report free kilobytes (not disk blocks), or
free inodes if -i is used, in the file systems
holding the directories given on the command line. (A
kilobyte in this case is 1024 bytes.) If only one directory
is given, the output will be a simple number; if more than
one directory is given, the output will be formatted for
human readability.

If
enableoverview is set to true in inn.conf,
inndf can also be used to get information about the
overview database. With the -n option, it reports a
count of the total number of overview records stored. With
-o, it reports the percentage of space used in the
overview database (for those overview methods where this is
meaningful data).

OPTIONS

-f
filename

filename should contain
a list of directories to use in addition to those given by
the arguments, one per line. Blank lines and anything after
"#" on any line are ignored.

-F

Like -f except that the filename is
pathetc/filesystems and it is not an error if this
file doesn’t exist. (This option is used primarily by
such things as innstat(8), so that the news administrator
can add additional file systems to check to
pathetc/filesystems without having to modify the
script.) 

-h

Print a usage message and exit.

-i

Report the number of free inodes rather than the amount
of free disk space.

-n

Report the total number of records in the overview
database. Note that crossposted articles will have one
overview record for each newsgroup they’re posted
to. 

-o

Report the percentage usage of the overview database
space. This is only meaningful for overview methods that
pre-allocate a certain amount of space rather than grow to
accommodate more records. Currently, this flag is only
useful for the buffindexed overview method.

EXAMPLES

Print the free
kilobytes in pathspool as a simple number:

inndf

Report the free
inodes in pathnews and pathspool in a format
designed for human readability:

inndf -i

The same, but
also add in all file systems in
pathetc/filesystems:

inndf -i -F

Print out the
number of overview records and the percentage space used by
a buffindexed overview database:

inndf -no
