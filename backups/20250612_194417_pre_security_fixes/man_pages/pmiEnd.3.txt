Perl SYNOPSIS

use
PCP::LogImport;

pmiEnd();

DESCRIPTION

As part of the
Performance Co-Pilot Log Import API (see
LOGIMPORT(3)), pmiEnd closes the current
context, forcing the trailer records to be written to the
PCP archive files, and then these files are closed.

In normal
operations, an application would include a call to
pmiEnd at the end of processing for each context
created with a call to pmiStart(3).

DIAGNOSTICS

pmiEnd
returns zero on success else a negative value that can be
turned into an error message by calling
pmiErrStr(3).
