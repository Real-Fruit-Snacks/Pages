NAME

atNetworkPath,
atLocalPath - network path handling

SYNOPSIS

#include

#include 

char*
atNetworkPath (Af_key *aso);

char*
atLocalPath (char *networkPath);

DESCRIPTION

atNetworkPath
returns a network wide unique pathname for aso. The
pathname has the following structure

:@.
Hostname is the name of the host controlling the device,
where aso is stored. the canonical pathname is the
real pathname (without symbolic links), where the object is
located on that host. The version number, including the
introducing at-sign (@) is optional. For busy versions, it
may be missing or the string busy

atLocalPath maps a
network path name to a local path name. When the host
information in the network path denotes a remote host,
atLocalPath looks up /etc/mtab for a mapping of the network
canonical pathname to a local path. The resulting pathname
is a local pathname in bound notation

[version] with the
version number added in brackets. It may be converted into
an ASO descriptor by calling atBindVersion (manual page
atbind(3)).

RETURN VALUE

Both functions
return the resulting string in static memory. The result
will be overwritten on a subsequent call. On failure, a null
pointer is returned.
