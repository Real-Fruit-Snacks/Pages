NAME

nbdkit-random-plugin
- plugin to serve random data

SYNOPSIS

nbdkit random
[size=]SIZE [seed=SEED]

DESCRIPTION

"nbdkit-random-plugin"
is a plugin for nbdkit(1) which serves random data.
This plugin is mainly good for testing NBD clients. This
plugin creates a non-sparse random disk, for a sparse random
disk see nbdkit-sparse-random-plugin(1).

The size of the
virtual disk must be specified using the "size"
parameter. If you specify the "seed" parameter
then you will get the same random data over multiple runs
with the same seed.

The random data
is generated using an insecure method.

Writes and
testing copying 
Writing to the disk is possible. If you do this the plugin
will check that what you are writing exactly matches what
would be read at the same offset (if not, it returns EIO
error). You can use this to test copying programs by making
the source and destination NBD URIs be the same:

nbdkit random
size=100M --run 'nbdcopy "$uri"
"$uri"'

"qemu-img
convert" could be used in place of nbdcopy. See also
nbdkit-checkwrite-filter(1).

PARAMETERS

[size=]SIZE

Specify the virtual size of the
disk image.

This parameter
is required.

"size="
is a magic config key and may be omitted in most cases. See
"Magic parameters" in nbdkit(1).

seed=SEED

Specify the random seed to get
repeatable data over multiple runs.

If not
specified then a random seed is chosen.

FILES

Use
"nbdkit --dump-config" to find the location of
$plugindir.
