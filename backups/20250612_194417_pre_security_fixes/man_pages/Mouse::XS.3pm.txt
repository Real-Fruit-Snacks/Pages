NAME
       Mouse::XS - A Mouse guts in XS

VERSION
       This document describes Mouse version 2.0.0

DESCRIPTION
       Mouse has an optional XS implementation, which is automatically built
       and used if available. According to benchmarks, this is about 2 times
       faster than Mouse::PurePerl.

   INSTALL
       The XS implementation are selected by default, but you can force it by
       passing the "--xs" option to Makefile.PL.

           perl Makefile.PL --xs

       If you do not want to build the XS implementation, you can pass the
       "--pp" option to Makefile.PL.

           perl Makefile.PL --pp

       Or if you use "cpanm" (>= 1.7), you can give "--pp" option to "cpanm".

           cpanm --pp Mouse

   The MOUSE_PUREPERL (or PERL_ONLY) environment variable
       It can be used to enable the use of Mouse::PurePerl in order to test
       and debug programs that use Mouse.

CAVEAT
       There are some Mouse::XS specific features.

       Mutating references to the return values of getters
           When you take a reference from Mouse getters, like "$ref =
           \$obj->foo", the $ref refers "\$obj->{foo}". That is, mutating
           $$ref also alters "$obj->{foo}". The behavior may confuse you so
           you'd better avoid to take a reference directly from getters.

           See <https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=82945> for details.

DEPENDENCIES
       The XS implementation requires Perl 5.8.1 or later, and a C compiler.
