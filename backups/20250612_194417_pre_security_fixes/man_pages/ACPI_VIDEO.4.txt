ACPI_VIDEO(4)

NAME

acpi_video — ACPI
Video Extensions driver

SYNOPSIS

device acpi_video

DESCRIPTION

This driver uses the ACPI Video
Extensions to control display switching and backlight
brightness. The availability of the sysctl(8) variables
depends on the functions offered by the host’s ACPI
implementation.

SYSCTL VARIABLES

The following sysctls are
currently implemented, where ⟨ device⟩ is
crt, lcd, or tv:

hw.acpi.video.⟨

device⟩ .active

Current state of the output
device.

hw.acpi.video.⟨

device⟩ .levels

List of supported brightness
levels.

hw.acpi.video.⟨

device⟩ .brightness

Current brightness level of the
device.

hw.acpi.video.⟨

device⟩ .fullpower

Preset brightness level to be
used in full power mode.

hw.acpi.video.⟨

device⟩ .economy

Preset brightness level to be
used in economy mode.

Defaults for
these variables can be set in sysctl.conf(5), which is
parsed at boot-time.

sysctl.conf(5), sysctl(8)

HISTORY

The acpi_video driver
first appeared in FreeBSD 5.3.

BUGS

Some systems only perform output
switching via SMM even though they export the proper
information via ACPI. On such systems, the proper hotkeys or
OEM driver (for example, acpi_toshiba(4)) must be used
instead.
