- release notes for libnbd 1.6

DESCRIPTION

These are the
release notes for libnbd stable release 1.6. This describes
the major changes since 1.4.

libnbd 1.6.0
was released on 7 January 2021.

Security

There were no security issues found in this release.

If you find a
security issue, please read SECURITY in the source
(online here:
https://gitlab.com/nbdkit/libnbd/blob/master/SECURITY). To
find out about previous security issues in libnbd, see
libnbd-security(3).

New APIs

nbd_set_strict_mode(3) 
nbd_get_strict_mode(3)

This API allows you to control
how libnbd handles requests from the program that it thinks
would trigger undefined behaviour in the server (such as
sending unknown commands, zero-sized or out-of-bounds
requests, etc). Normally libnbd is very strict and will
prevent you from sending such requests, but you can use this
API to relax these restrictions, leaving it up to the server
to handle or reject them. Some servers may crash if you do
this.

nbd_get_nr_meta_contexts(3)

nbd_get_meta_context(3) 
nbd_clear_meta_contexts(3)

These APIs allow you to review
or clear the requested metadata contexts.

nbd_opt_list_meta_context(3)

nbd_aio_opt_list_meta_context(3)

Request that the server lists
available metadata contexts. You can only use this in opt
mode.

Thanks: Eric
Blake for all of the new APIs.

Enhancements
to existing APIs 
nbd_shutdown(3) new flag
"LIBNBD_SHUTDOWN_ABANDON_PENDING" drops any
commands in flight which have not been sent to the server
yet (Eric Blake).

All APIs which
have flag (bitmask) parameters now define a
"LIBNBD_*_MASK" constant allowing you to tell
which bits represent valid flags at compilation time (Eric
Blake).

New
features 
The performance of the nbdcopy(1) tool has been
greatly improved. Also it supports numerous new
features.

New
nbdinfo(1) --map option showing the allocated
and sparse extents of an NBD server. This can also show
other information such as dirty bitmaps.

Tools 
nbdfuse(1) can now mount the NBD export on top of any
regular file, it does not have to mount over a
directory.

nbdsh(1)
now produces a nice error message if the URI in the
-u option or the command in the -c option is
wrong (Eric Blake).

New
nbdsh(1) --opt-mode option which requests opt
mode on the handle before connecting.

nbdinfo(1)
--list option now shows the supported metadata
contexts of the server (Eric Blake).

The output of
nbdinfo(1) is now usually printed atomically, ie. it
will either print the complete output or an error message,
but not partial output followed by an error.

nbdinfo(1)
can now decode "qemu:allocation-depth" metacontext
(Eric Blake).

Other
improvements and bug fixes 
Multiple improvements to handling of NBD protocol (Eric
Blake).

Fix handling of
booleans in Python bindings (Eric Blake).

Fix handling of
flags parameters in OCaml bindings (Eric Blake).

Python style
fixes (Eric Blake).

Fix multiple
memory leaks (Eric Blake).

OCaml bindings
now include ocamldoc-generated documentation, if ocamldoc is
installed at build time.

The
"vector" library from nbdkit is now used by
libnbd, simplifying places where we used to use
realloc(3).
