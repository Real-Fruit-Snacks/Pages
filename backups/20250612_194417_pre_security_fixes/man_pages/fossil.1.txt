FEATURES

Features as
described on the fossil home page.

1. Integrated Bug Tracking,
Wiki, Forum, and Technotes

- In addition

to doing distributed version
control like Git and Mercurial, Fossil also supports bug
tracking, wiki, forum, and technotes.

2. Built-in Web
Interface 

- Fossil has a built-in and
intuitive web

interface that promotes project
situational awareness. Type "fossil ui" and Fossil
automatically opens a web browser to a page that shows
detailed graphical history and status information on that
project.

3. Self-Contained

- Fossil is a single
self-contained stand-alone

executable. To install, simply
download a precompiled binary for Linux, Mac, OpenBSD, or
Windows and put it on your $PATH. Easy-to-compile source
code is available for users on other platforms.

4. Simple Networking

- No custom protocols or TCP
ports. Fossil uses

plain old HTTP (or HTTPS or
SSH) for all network communications, so it works fine from
behind restrictive firewalls, including proxies. The
protocol is bandwidth efficient to the point that Fossil can
be used comfortably over dial-up or over the exceedingly
slow Wifi on airliners.

5. CGI/SCGI Enabled

- No server is required, but if
you want to set

one up, Fossil supports four
easy server configurations.

6. Autosync

- Fossil supports
"autosync" mode which helps to keep

projects moving forward by
reducing the amount of needless forking and merging often
associated with distributed projects.

7. Robust &
Reliable 

- Fossil stores content using an
enduring file

format in an SQLite database so
that transactions are atomic even if interrupted by a power
loss or system crash. Automatic self-checks verify that all
aspects of the repository are consistent prior to each
commit.

8. Free and
Open-Source 

- Uses the 2-clause BSD
license.
