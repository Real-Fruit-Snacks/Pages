LGE(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual LGE(4)

NAME

lge — Level 1
LXT1001 NetCellerator PCI Gigabit Ethernet adapter
driver

SYNOPSIS

To compile this driver into the
kernel, place the following lines in your kernel
configuration file:

device
miibus 
device lge

Alternatively,
to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following line in loader.conf(5):

if_lge_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION

The lge driver provides
support for various NICs based on the Level 1 LXT1001
NetCellerator Gigabit Ethernet controller chip.

The LXT1001
supports fiber PHYs and also a GMII port for use with
10/100/1000 copper PHYs, however there are currently no NICs
on the market that use this feature.

The LXT1001
supports TCP/IP checksum offload for receive and VLAN-based
filtering as well as a 64-bit multicast hash filter. It also
supports jumbo frames, which can be configured via the
interface MTU setting. Selecting an MTU larger than 1500
bytes with the ifconfig(8) utility configures the adapter to
receive and transmit jumbo frames. Using jumbo frames can
greatly improve performance for certain tasks, such as file
transfers and data streaming.

The lge
driver supports the following media types:

autoselect

Enable
autoselection of the media type and options. The user can
manually override the autoselected mode by adding media
options to rc.conf(5).

1000baseSX

Set 1000baseSX
operation over fiber optic cable. Both full-duplex
and half-duplex modes are supported.

The lge
driver supports the following media options:

full-duplex

Force full
duplex operation.

half-duplex

Force half
duplex operation.

For more
information on configuring this device, see ifconfig(8).

HARDWARE

Adapters supported by the
lge driver include:

•

SMC TigerCard 1000
(SMC9462SX)

•

D-Link DGE-500SX

DIAGNOSTICS

lge%d: couldn’t map
memory  A fatal initialization error has
occurred.

lge%d:
couldn’t map ports  A fatal initialization
error has occurred.

lge%d:
couldn’t map interrupt  A fatal
initialization error has occurred.

lge%d: no
memory for softc struct!  The driver failed to
allocate memory for per-device instance information during
initialization.

lge%d: failed
to enable memory mapping!  The driver failed to
initialize PCI shared memory mapping. This might happen if
the card is not in a bus-master slot.

lge%d: no
memory for jumbo buffers!  The driver failed to
allocate memory for jumbo frames during initialization.

lge%d:
watchdog timeout  The device has stopped responding
to the network, or there is a problem with the network
connection (cable).
