NAME

qdiskd −
Cluster Quorum Disk Daemon

SYNOPSIS

qdiskd
[−f] [−d]

DESCRIPTION

The
qdiskd daemon talks to CMAN and provides a mechanism
for determining node-fitness in a cluster environment. See
qdisk(5) for configuration information.

OPTIONS

−f

Run in the foreground (do not
fork / daemonize).

−d

Enable debug output.

−Q

Close stdin/out/err immediately before doing
validations. This is primarily for use when being called
from an init script. Using this option will stop all output,
and can not be used with the -d option.
