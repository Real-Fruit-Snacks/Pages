IPFW(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual IPFW(4)

NAME

ipfw â€” IP packet
filter and traffic accounting

SYNOPSIS

To compile the driver into the
kernel, place the following option in the kernel
configuration file:

options
IPFIREWALL

Other related
kernel options which may also be useful are:

options
IPFIREWALL_DEFAULT_TO_ACCEPT 
options IPFIREWALL_VERBOSE 
options IPFIREWALL_VERBOSE_LIMIT=100

To load the
driver as a module at boot time, add the following line into
the loader.conf(5) file:

ipfw_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION

The ipfw system facility
allows filtering, redirecting, and other operations on IP
packets travelling through network interfaces.

The default
behavior of ipfw is to block all incoming and
outgoing traffic. This behavior can be modified, to allow
all traffic through the ipfw firewall by default, by
enabling the IPFIREWALL_DEFAULT_TO_ACCEPT kernel option.
This option may be useful when configuring ipfw for
the first time. If the default ipfw behavior is to
allow everything, it is easier to cope with firewall-tuning
mistakes which may accidentally block all traffic.

To enable
logging of packets passing through ipfw, enable the
IPFIREWALL_VERBOSE kernel option. The
IPFIREWALL_VERBOSE_LIMIT option will prevent syslogd(8) from
flooding system logs or causing local Denial of Service.
This option may be set to the number of packets which will
be logged on a per-entry basis before the entry is
rate-limited.

The user
interface for ipfw is implemented by the ipfw(8)
utility, so please refer to the ipfw(8) manpage for a
complete description of the ipfw capabilities and how
to use it.
