NAME

courierpop3d -
The Courier POP3 server

SYNOPSIS

/usr/sbin/couriertcpd
{-nodnslookup} {-stderr=syslog} {110}
{/usr/lib/courier/courier/courierpop3login}
[modules...] {/usr/lib/courier/courier/courierpop3d}
{./Maildir} 

DESCRIPTION

This is a
simple POP3 server for Maildirs.

Note

The couriertcpd, courierpop3login, and
courierpop3d modules may be installed elsewhere than
indicated here.

courierpop3login
is usually started by couriertcpd. It already expects
that a POP3 client is connected to standard input and
output, presumably via a network socket.
courierpop3login reads the POP3 userid and password,
then runs the authentication modules. The remaining
arguments are passed along as arguments to modules.

modules is one
or more authentication modules (see the
authlib(7)
[1]
manual page).

Each
authentication modules runs the program specified by its
first argument, allowing the authentication modules to be
chained. The last program in the chain is
courierpop3d , which provides the actual POP3
service. In accordance with the authentication protocol, as
described in
authlib(7)
[1]
courierpop3d reads file
descriptor 3 to see if the userid/password has been
succesfully validated. If not, courierpop3d
terminates.

Otherwise,
courierpop3d expects to be already running under the
appropriate user and group id, with its current directory
set to the account's home directory.

The
first order of business is to find the account's Maildir. If
the environment variable MAILDIR is set, that's where
we go. That should be the pathname to the account's Maildir.
The environment variable MAILDIR may be set by the
authentication module. If MAILDIR is not set,
courierpop3d uses its first argument. Usually, the
default maildir is $HOME/Maildir, therefore the first
argument to courierpop3d is
"./Maildir".
