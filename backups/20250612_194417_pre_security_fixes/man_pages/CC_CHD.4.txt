CC_CHD(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual CC_CHD(4)

NAME

cc_chd — CHD
Congestion Control Algorithm

DESCRIPTION

CHD enhances the HD algorithm
implemented in cc_hd(4). It provides tolerance to
non-congestion related packet loss and improvements to
coexistence with traditional loss-based TCP flows,
especially when the bottleneck link is lightly
multiplexed.

Like HD, the
algorithm aims to keep network queuing delays below a
particular threshold (queue_threshold) and decides to reduce
the congestion window (cwnd) probabilistically based on its
estimate of the network queuing delay.

It differs from
HD in three key aspects:

•

The probability of cwnd
reduction due to congestion is calculated once per round
trip time instead of each time an acknowledgement is
received as done by cc_hd(4).

•

Packet losses that occur while
the queuing delay is less than queue_threshold do not cause
cwnd to be reduced.

•

CHD uses a shadow window to
help regain lost transmission opportunities when competing
with loss-based TCP flows.

MIB Variables

The algorithm exposes the
following tunable variables in the
net.inet.tcp.cc.chd branch of the sysctl(3) MIB:

queue_threshold

Queueing
congestion threshold (qth) in ticks. Default is 20.

pmax

Per RTT maximum
backoff probability as a percentage. Default is 50.

qmin

Minimum queuing
delay threshold (qmin) in ticks. Default is 5.

loss_fair

If 1, cwnd is
adjusted using the shadow window when a congestion related
loss is detected. Default is 1.

use_max

If 1, the
maximum RTT seen within the measurement period is used as
the basic delay measurement for the algorithm, otherwise a
sampled RTT measurement is used. Default is 1.

HISTORY

The cc_chd congestion
control module first appeared in FreeBSD 9.0.

The module was
first released in 2010 by David Hayes whilst working on the
NewTCP research project at Swinburne University of
Technology’s Centre for Advanced Internet
Architectures, Melbourne, Australia. More details are
