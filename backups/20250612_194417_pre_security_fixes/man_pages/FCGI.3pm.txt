NAME
       FCGI - Fast CGI module

SYNOPSIS
           use FCGI;

           my $count = 0;
           my $request = FCGI::Request();

           while($request->Accept() >= 0) {
               print("Content-type: text/html\r\n\r\n", ++$count);
           }

DESCRIPTION
       Functions:

       FCGI::Request
           Creates a request handle. It has the following optional parameters:

           input perl file handle (default: \*STDIN)
           output perl file handle (default: \*STDOUT)
           error perl file handle (default: \*STDERR)
                   These filehandles will be setup to act as
                   input/output/error on successful Accept.

           environment hash reference (default: \%ENV)
                   The hash will be populated with the environment.

           socket (default: 0)
                   Socket to communicate with the server.  Can be the result
                   of the OpenSocket function.  For the moment, it's the file
                   descriptor of the socket that should be passed. This may
                   change in the future.

                   You should only use your own socket if your program is not
                   started by a process manager such as mod_fastcgi (except
                   for the FastCgiExternalServer case) or cgi-fcgi.  If you
                   use the option, you have to let your FastCGI server know
                   which port (and possibly server) your program is listening
                   on.  See remote.pl for an example.

           flags (default: FCGI::FAIL_ACCEPT_ON_INTR)
                   Possible values:

                   FCGI::FAIL_ACCEPT_ON_INTR
                               If set, Accept will fail if interrupted.  It
                               not set, it will just keep on waiting.

           Example usage:
               my $req = FCGI::Request;

           or:
               my %env;
               my $in = new IO::Handle;
               my $out = new IO::Handle;
               my $err = new IO::Handle;
               my $req = FCGI::Request($in, $out, $err, \%env);

       FCGI::OpenSocket(path, backlog)
           Creates a socket suitable to use as an argument to Request.

           path    Pathname of socket or colon followed by local tcp port.
                   Note that some systems take file permissions into account
                   on Unix domain sockets, so you'll have to make sure that
                   the server can write to the created file, by changing the
                   umask before the call and/or changing permissions and/or
                   group of the file afterwards.

           backlog Maximum length of the queue of pending connections.  If a
                   connection request arrives with the queue full the client
                   may receive an  error  with  an  indication of
                   ECONNREFUSED.

       FCGI::CloseSocket(socket)
           Close a socket opened with OpenSocket.

       $req->Accept()
           Accepts a connection on $req, attaching the filehandles and
           populating the environment hash.  Returns 0 on success.  If a
           connection has been accepted before, the old one will be finished
           first.

           Note that unlike with the old interface, no die and warn handlers
           are installed by default. This means that if you are not running an
           sfio enabled perl, any warn or die message will not end up in the
           server's log by default.  It is advised you set up die and warn
           handlers yourself.  FCGI.pm contains an example of die and warn
           handlers.

       $req->Finish()
           Finishes accepted connection.  Also detaches filehandles.

       $req->Flush()
           Flushes accepted connection.

       $req->Detach()
           Temporarily detaches filehandles on an accepted connection.

       $req->Attach()
           Re-attaches filehandles on an accepted connection.

       $req->LastCall()
           Tells the library not to accept any more requests on this handle.
           It should be safe to call this method from signal handlers.

           Note that this method is still experimental and everything about
           it, including its name, is subject to change.

       $env = $req->GetEnvironment()
           Returns the environment parameter passed to FCGI::Request.

       ($in, $out, $err) = $req->GetHandles()
           Returns the file handle parameters passed to FCGI::Request.

       $isfcgi = $req->IsFastCGI()
           Returns whether or not the program was run as a FastCGI.

LIMITATIONS
       FCGI.pm isn't Unicode aware, only characters within the range 0x00-0xFF
       are supported. Attempts to output strings containing characters above
       0xFF results in a exception: (F) "Wide character in %s".

       Users who wants the previous (FCGI.pm <= 0.68) incorrect behavior can
       disable the exception by using the "bytes" pragma.

           {
               use bytes;
               print "\x{263A}";
           }
