NAME

suffixes - list
of file suffixes

DESCRIPTION

It is customary
to indicate the contents of a file with the file suffix,
which (typically) consists of a period, followed by one or
more letters. Many standard utilities, such as compilers,
use this to recognize the type of file they are dealing
with. The make(1) utility is driven by rules based on
file suffix.

Following is a
list of suffixes which are likely to be found on a Linux
system.

CONFORMING TO

General UNIX
conventions.
