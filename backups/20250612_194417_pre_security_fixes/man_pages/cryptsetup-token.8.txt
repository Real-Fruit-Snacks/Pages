NAME

cryptsetup-token
- manage LUKS2 tokens

SYNOPSIS

cryptsetup
token 
[] 

DESCRIPTION

Action
add creates a new keyring token to enable
auto-activation of the device. For the auto-activation, the
passphrase must be stored in keyring with the specified
description. Usually, the passphrase should be stored in
user or user-session keyring. The token
command is supported only for LUKS2.

For adding new
keyring token, option --key-description is mandatory. Also,
new token is assigned to key slot specified with --key-slot
option or to all active key slots in the case --key-slot
option is omitted.

To remove
existing token, specify the token ID which should be removed
with --token-id option.

WARNING:
The action token remove removes any token type, not
just keyring type from token slot specified by
--token-id option.

Action
import can store arbitrary valid token json in LUKS2
header. It may be passed via standard input or via file
passed in --json-file option. If you specify --key-slot then
successfully imported token is also assigned to the key
slot.

Action
export writes requested token JSON to a file passed
with --json-file or to standard output.

Action
unassign removes token binding to specified keyslot.
Both token and keyslot must be specified by --token-id and
--key-slot parameters.

If --token-id
is used with action add or action import and a
token with that ID already exists, option --token-replace
can be used to replace the existing token.

can be [--header, --token-id, --key-slot, --key-description,
--disable-external-tokens, --disable-locks,
--disable-keyring, --json-file, --token-replace, --unbound,
--external-tokens-path].

OPTIONS

--batch-mode,
-q

Suppresses all confirmation
questions. Use with care!

If the
--verify-passphrase option is not specified, this option
also switches off the passphrase verification.

--debug or
--debug-json

Run in debug mode with full
diagnostic logs. Debug output lines are always prefixed by
#.

If --debug-json
is used, additional LUKS2 JSON data structures are
printed.

--disable-external-tokens

Disable loading of plugins for
external LUKS2 tokens.

--disable-keyring

Do not load volume key in
kernel keyring and store it directly in the dm-crypt target
instead. This option is supported only for the LUKS2
type.

--disable-locks

Disable lock protection for
metadata on disk. This option is valid only for LUKS2 and
ignored for other formats.

WARNING:
Do not use this option unless you run cryptsetup in a
restricted environment where locking is impossible to
perform (where /run directory cannot be used).

--external-tokens-path
absolute_path

Override system directory path
where cryptsetup searches for external token handlers (or
token plugins). It must be absolute path (starting with '/'
character).

--header

Use a detached (separated)
metadata device or file where the LUKS header is stored.
This option allows one to store ciphertext and LUKS header
on different devices.

For commands
that change the LUKS header (e.g. luksAddKey),
specify the device or file with the LUKS header directly as
the LUKS device.

--help,
-?

Show help text and default
parameters.

--json-file

Read token JSON from a file or
write token to it. --json-file=- reads JSON from standard
input or writes it to standard output respectively.

--key-description

Set key description in keyring
for use with token command.

--key-slot,
-S 

For LUKS operations that add
key material, this option allows you to specify which key
slot is selected for the new key.

The maximum
number of key slots depends on the LUKS version. LUKS1 can
have up to 8 key slots. LUKS2 can have up to 32 key slots
based on key slot area size and key size, but a valid key
slot ID can always be between 0 and 31 for LUKS2.

--token-id

Specify token number. If
omitted, first unused token id is used when adding or
importing new token.

--token-replace

Replace an existing token when
adding or importing a token with the --token-id option.

--unbound

Creates new LUKS2 keyring token
assigned to no keyslot. Usable only with add
action.

--usage

Show short option help.

--version,
-V

Show the program version.

REPORTING BUGS

Report bugs at

Please
attach output of the failed command with --debug option
added.
