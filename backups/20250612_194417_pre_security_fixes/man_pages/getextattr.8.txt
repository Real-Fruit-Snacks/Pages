NAME

— manipulate extended attributes

SYNOPSIS

getextattr
[−fhqsx] attrnamespace attrname filename
... 
lsextattr [−fhq] attrnamespace filename
... 
rmextattr [−fhq] attrnamespace attrname
filename ... 
setextattr [−fhnq] attrnamespace

DESCRIPTION

These utilities are user tools
to manipulate the named extended attributes on files and
directories. The attrnamespace argument should be the
namespace of the attribute to retrieve: legal values are
user and system. The attrname argument
should be the name of the attribute, filename the
name of the target file or directory, attrvalue a
string to store in the attribute.

The following
options are available:

−f

(Force.) Ignore
errors on individual filenames and continue with the
remaining arguments.

−h

(No follow.) If
the file is a symbolic link, perform the operation on the
link itself rather than the file that the link points
to.

−n

(NUL-terminate.)
NUL-terminate the extent content written out.

−q

(Quiet.) Do not
print out the pathname and suppress error messages.

−s

(Stringify.)
Escape nonprinting characters and put quotes around the
output.

−x

(Hex.) Print
the output in hexadecimal.

EXAMPLES

setextattr system md5 ’md5
-q /boot/kernel/kernel’ /boot/kernel/kernel 
getextattr system md5 /boot/kernel/kernel 
lsextattr system /boot/kernel/kernel 
rmextattr system md5 /boot/kernel/kernel

HISTORY

Extended attribute support was
developed as part of the TrustedBSD Project, and introduced
in FreeBSD 5.0. It was developed to support security
extensions requiring additional labels to be associated with
each file or directory.
