NAME

deb-shlibs -
Debian shared library information file

SYNOPSIS

debian/shlibs,
debian/binary-name.shlibs,
DEBIAN/shlibs

DESCRIPTION

shlibs
files map shared library names and versions (SONAMEs)
to dependencies suitable for a package control file. There
is one entry per line. Blank lines are not allowed.
Lines beginning with an # character are considered
commentary, and are ignored. All other lines must have the
format:

[type:]
library version dependencies

The
library and version fields are
whitespace-delimited, but the dependencies field
extends to the end of the line. The type field is
optional and normally not needed.

The
dependencies field has the same syntax as the
Depends field in a binary control file, see
deb-control(5).

SONAME FORMATS

The
SONAME formats supported are:

name.so.version

and

name-version.so

where
name is usually prefixed by lib.

EXAMPLES

The
shlibs file for a typical library package, named
libcrunch1, that provides one library whose
SONAME is libcrunch.so.1, might
read

 libcrunch 1 libcrunch1 (>= 1.2-1)

The
dependencies must mention the most recent version of
the package that added new symbols to the library: in the
above example, new symbols were added to version 1.2 of
libcrunch. This is not the only reason the
dependencies might need to be tightened.
