DESCRIPTION

The libsystemd
library provides functions that allow interacting with
various interfaces provided by the systemd(1) service
manager, as well as various other functions and constants
useful for implementing services in general.

See
sd-bus(3), sd-bus-errors(3),
sd-daemon(3), sd-device(3),
sd-event(3), sd-hwdb(3), sd-id128(3),
sd-journal(3), and sd-login(3) for information
about different parts of the library interface.

INTERFACE STABILITY

Strict
backwards-compatibility is maintained for the API
(application programming interface) and ABI (application
binary interface). Symbol versioning is used, with symbols
only added and never removed.

NOTES

Functions
described here are available as a shared library, which can
be compiled against and linked to with the
libsystemd pkg-config(1) file.

The code
described here uses getenv(3), which is declared to
be not multi-thread-safe. This means that the code calling
the functions described here must not call setenv(3)
from a parallel thread. It is recommended to only do calls
to setenv() from an early phase of the program when
no other threads have been started.
