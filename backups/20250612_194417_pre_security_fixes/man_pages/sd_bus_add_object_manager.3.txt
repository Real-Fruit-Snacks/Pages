NAME

sd_bus_add_object_manager
- Add a D-Bus object manager for a D-Bus object sub-tree

SYNOPSIS

#include

int
sd_bus_add_object_manager(sd_bus *bus,
sd_bus_slot **slot,
const char *path); 

DESCRIPTION

sd_bus_add_object_manager()
installs a handler for the given path that implements the
GetManagedObjects() method of the
org.freedesktop.DBus.ObjectManager interface. See
org.freedesktop.DBus.ObjectManager
[1]
for more information.

To
implement the InterfacesAdded and
InterfacesRemoved signals of the
org.freedesktop.DBus.ObjectManager interface, call
sd_bus_emit_interfaces_added(3) and
sd_bus_emit_interfaces_removed(3) whenever interfaces
are added or removed from the sub-tree,
respectively.

When
sd_bus_add_object_manager() succeeds, a slot is
created internally. If the output parameter slot is
NULL, a "floating" slot object is created,
see sd_bus_slot_set_floating(3). Otherwise, a pointer
to the slot object is returned. In that case, the reference
to the slot object should be dropped when the object manager
is not needed anymore, see
sd_bus_slot_unref(3).

RETURN VALUE

On
success, sd_bus_add_object_manager() returns a
non-negative integer. On failure, it returns a negative
errno-style error code.

Errors

Returned errors may indicate the following
problems:

-EINVAL

One of
the required parameters is NULL or path is not
a valid object path.

-ENOPKG

The bus
cannot be resolved.

-ECHILD

The bus
was created in a different process, library or module
instance.

-ENOMEM

Memory
allocation failed.

NOTES

Functions
described here are available as a shared library, which can
be compiled against and linked to with the
libsystemd pkg-config(1) file.

The
code described here uses getenv(3), which is declared
to be not multi-thread-safe. This means that the code
calling the functions described here must not call
setenv(3) from a parallel thread. It is recommended
to only do calls to setenv() from an early phase of
the program when no other threads have been
started.

HISTORY

sd_bus_add_object_manager()
was added in version 221.
