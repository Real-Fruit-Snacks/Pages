NAME

AF_ROSE - Rose
amateur packet radio protocol family

DESCRIPTION

Rose is
a protocol used extensively by radio amateurs. The Linux
Rose protocol family permits access to these protocols via
the standard networking socket metaphor.

The Rose
protocol layer only supports connected mode.

The only mode
of operation is connected mode which is the mode used for a
socket of type SOCK_SEQPACKET (stream sockets are not
available in Rose). This requires that the user ensures
output data is suitably packetised, and that input data is
read a packet at a time into a buffer of suitable size.

Rose addresses
consist of 10 digits. These are encoded into a sockaddr_rose
structure which is provided to the relevant system
calls.

Rose has some
unusual properties. Notably in a multi-user system an AX.25
address is often associated with a user, and some users may
not have such an association. a set of ioctl calls are
provided to manage an association table.

Rose supports
the following socket options for SOL_ROSE. ROSE_T1 is the
T11/T21 timer in 1/10ths of a second, ROSE_T2 is the T12/T22
timer in 1/10ths of a second. ROSE_T3, is the T13/T23 timer
in 1/10ths of a second. It is possible for an application to
request that the Rose layer return the Rose header as well
as the application data, this is done via the ROSE_HDRINCL
socket option.
