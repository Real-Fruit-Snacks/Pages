NAME

hciattach -
attach serial devices via UART HCI to BlueZ stack

SYNOPSIS

hciattach
[OPTIONS] tty> type|id>
[speed] [flow] [sleep]
[bdaddr]

hciattach
-1

DESCRIPTION

hciattach(1)
is used to attach a serial UART to the Bluetooth stack as
HCI transport interface.

OPTIONS

-i

Send break

-n

Don't detach from controlling terminal.

-p

Print the PID when detaching.

-t timeout

Specify an initialization
timeout. Default is 5 seconds.

-s speed

Specify an initial speed
instead of the hardware default.

-l

List all available configurations.

-r

Set the HCI device into raw mode. The kernel and
bluetooth daemon will ignore it.

-h, --help

Show help options

ARGUMENTS

show

This specifies the serial device
to attach. A leading /dev can be omitted.

Examples:
/dev/ttyS1 ttyS2

type|id

The type or id of
the Bluetooth device that is to be attached, i.e. vendor or
other device specific identifier. Currently supported types
are

speed

The speed specifies the UART speed to use.
Baudrates higher than 115200bps require vendor specific
initializations that are not implemented for all types of
devices. In general the following speeds are supported:

Supported
vendor devices are automatically initialised to their
respective best settings.

flow

If the flow is appended
to the list of options then hardware flow control is forced
on the serial link (CRTSCTS). All above mentioned
device types have flow set by default. To force no flow
control use noflow instead.

sleep|nosleep

Enables hardware specific power
management feature. If sleep is appended to the list
of options then this feature is enabled. To disable this
feature use nosleep instead. All above mentioned
device types have nosleep set by default.

Note: This
option will only be valid for hardware which support
hardware specific power management enable option from
host.

bdaddr

The bdaddr specifies the Bluetooth Address to use. Some
devices (like the STLC2500) do not store the Bluetooth
address in hardware memory. Instead it must be uploaded
during the initialization process. If this argument is
specified, then the address will be used to initialize the
device. Otherwise, a default address will be used.
