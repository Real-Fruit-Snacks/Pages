NAME

pnmcut -
replaced by pamcut

DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

pnmcut
was obsoleted by pamcut(1), introduced with Netpbm
9.20 (May 2001). pamcut is backward compatible with
pnmcut, plus adds many additional functions,
including the ability to process PAM images.

pnmcut
remained in the Netpbm package until Netpbm 10.46 (March
2009) because of hopes that it had fewer bugs than
pamcut because of its age. But now it would just be
clutter.

In Netpbm
before 9.20, use the manual for pamcut with
pnmcut. Features that are in pamcut but not
pnmcut are indicated by statements that they
didn’t exist before 9.20.
