Description

grap2graph
reads a grap(1) program from the standard input and
writes an image file, by default in Portable Network
Graphics (PNG) format, to the standard output.

The input GRAP
code should not be wrapped with the .G1 and
.G2 macros that normally guard it within
groff(1) documents.

Arguments not
recognized by grap2graph are passed to the
ImageMagick or GraphicsMagick program convert(1). By
specifying these, you can give your image a border, set the
image’s pixel density, or perform other useful
transformations.

The output
image is clipped using convert’s -trim
option to the smallest possible bounding box that contains
all the black pixels.

Options

--help
displays a usage message, while -v and
--version show version information; all exit
afterward. 
-format output-format

Write the image in
output-format, which must be understood by
convert; the default is PNG.

-unsafe

Run groff in
unsafe mode, enabling the PIC command sh to
execute arbitrary Unix shell commands. The groff
default is to forbid this.

Environment
