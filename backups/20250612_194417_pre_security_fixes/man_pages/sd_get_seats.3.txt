NAME

sd_get_seats,
sd_get_sessions, sd_get_uids, sd_get_machine_names -
Determine available seats, sessions, logged in users and
virtual machines/containers

SYNOPSIS

#include

int
sd_get_seats(char ***seats); 

int
sd_get_sessions(char ***sessions); 

int
sd_get_uids(uid_t **users); 

int
sd_get_machine_names(char ***machines); 

DESCRIPTION

sd_get_seats()
may be used to determine all currently available local
seats. Returns the number of seat identifiers and if the
input pointer is non-NULL, a NULL-terminated
array of seat identifiers is stored at the address. The
returned array and all strings it references need to be
freed with the libc free(3) call after use. Note that
instead of an empty array NULL may be returned and
should be considered equivalent to an empty array.

Similarly,
sd_get_sessions() may be used to determine all
current login sessions.

Similarly,
sd_get_uids() may be used to determine all Unix users
who currently have login sessions.

Similarly,
sd_get_machine_names() may be used to determine all
current virtual machines and containers on the system.

Note that the
returned lists are not sorted and in an undefined order.

RETURN VALUE

On success,
sd_get_seats(), sd_get_sessions(),
sd_get_uids() and sd_get_machine_names()
return the number of entries in the arrays. On failure,
these calls return a negative errno-style error code.

Errors

Returned errors may indicate the following problems:

-ENOMEM

Memory allocation failed.

NOTES

Functions
described here are available as a shared library, which can
be compiled against and linked to with the
libsystemd pkg-config(1) file.

The code
described here uses getenv(3), which is declared to
be not multi-thread-safe. This means that the code calling
the functions described here must not call setenv(3)
from a parallel thread. It is recommended to only do calls
to setenv() from an early phase of the program when
no other threads have been started.

HISTORY

sd_get_machine_names()
was added in version 203.
