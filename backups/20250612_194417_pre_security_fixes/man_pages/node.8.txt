NAME

node −
Node front end for AX.25, NET/ROM, Rose and TCP

SYNOPSIS

node
[-c]

DESCRIPTION

Node is
a simple node front end, modelled after the node shells of
TheNet and G8BPQ nodes.

OPTIONS

−c

Enable compression. With this
option it is assumed that the incoming call is using Zlib
based compression (modified Lempel-Ziv 1977). Currently no
negotiation is done so the caller must be aware of this. You
probably want to set up a separate AX.25, NET/ROM or ROSE
callsign in ax25d.conf or a separate TCP port in inetd.conf
to listen to compressed connects.

At the moment I
know only two implementations compatible with this
compression method, namely LinuxNode and Clussed.

NODE COMMANDS

The following
commands are supported for users of node:

?

Give short list of available
commands. 

Bye

Disconnect user from the node.

Connect 
 [via  ...] [d|s] For AX.25 
Connect  [d|s] For NET/ROM 
Connect   [] [d|s]
For ROSE

Initiate an
AX.25, NET/ROM or ROSE connection to a remote host. If only
one argument is supplied then the connection is assumed to
be a NET/ROM connection and the argument specifies the
callsign of alias of a NET/ROM node. If more than one
argument is supplied and the second parameter is composed of
numeric characters only then the connection is assumed to be
a ROSE connection. Any other combination is assumed to be an
AX.25 connection with the first argument being the AX25 port
to use for the connection.

For a ROSE
connection the  part must be exactly six or
ten digits. If only six digits are supplied, the DNIC (first
four digits) default to the local DNIC. The local DNIC is
assumed to be that of the first configured Rose port in
/etc/ax25/rsports.

The user may
optionally supply as the last argument a single character
which modifies the default behaviour on disconnection of the
connection. If a single ’s’ is entered as the
last argument, then when the remote host disconnects you
will be returned to this node. If a single ’d’
is entered as the last argument, you will be disconnected
from this node too. The Default behaviour (neither
’s’ nor ’d’ entered) is configured
in the node configuration file and depends on the sysop
preference.

Escape []

Override the sysop configured
default escape character setting. If the Escape command is
given without an argument then the current escape character
setting is returned to the user. The escape string may be
specified using any of the well known codings:

to enter the escape character in its binary form.

^C to
enter the escape character as a control character value.

NNN to
set the escape character to a Decimal value.

0xNN to
set the escape character to a HexaDecimal value.

0NNN to
set the escape character to an Octal value.

off to
disable the escape character.

Finger
[][@]

Retrieve information about
users of a system. If the user name is omitted, shows the
users currently logged on the host. If the hostname is
omitted, defaults to the local host.

Help
[]

Give help for the specified
command or this text if no command is specified. Commands
can not be abbreviated. Use the "?" command to
retrieve a list of available commands.

HOst  |

Give the Domain Name Service
host name information about  or .

Info

Display the version information and the contents of the
/etc/ax25/node.info file, which should describe any aspects
of your system that you would like to brag about.

Links [* |
]

Give a list of active AX.25
connections to and from the local host. With an optional
argument * list also AX.25 sockets in state listening. A
callsign as argument gives a list of all connections with
 as source or destination address.

Mheard

Give a list of heard AX.25
stations on the specified port.

NLinks

Give a list of active NET/ROM connections to and from
the local host.

Nodes [* |
]

Show the NET/ROM node table of
the local host. The nodes on this list can be reached using
the Connect command without knowing the actual network path
used (assuming the network is OK).

The optional
argument ’*’ toggles verbose mode, showing the
Obsolescence counter, relative path quality and the port and
neighbour node used to reach each node. You can also specify
a node callsign to get the verbose information for a single
node. In that case a "which" field that tells what
route the kernel will use to reach the node is also
shown.

Ports

Show the available AX.25 ports. Shown are the port name
and a short description for the port. The port name is used
when using the Connect command to connect to an user or
service not running NET/ROM (eg. not visible in the Nodes
list). 

PIng 
[]

Check if a host can be reached
trough the network by sending an ICMP Echo Request packet to
the host and waiting for it to reply. If a reply is received
the round-trip-time (RTT) between the local and remote hosts
is shown.

If an optional
length is specified the data portion of the packet is filled
with length number of bytes.

Routes

Show the NET/ROM neighbour table of the local host (ie.
the nodes which the local node directly talks with). These
nodes are used to reach the other nodes on the node
table. 

Status

Give some more or less useful information about the
system. 

Telnet 
[] [] [d|s]

Initiate a telnet session to a
remote host using TCP/IP. By default, the telnet command
connects to the TCP port 23 (allocated for telnet). You can
specify another TCP port or a TCP port name.

If an optional
third argument  is given, that string,
followed by a CRLF is sent to the remote host right after
the connection is established. This is mainly useful for
command aliases.

If a single
’s’ is entered as the last parameter, then when
the remote host disconnects you will be returned to this
node. If a single ’d’ is entered as the last
parameter, you will be disconnected from this node too.
Default behaviour (neither ’s’ nor
’d’ entered) depends on sysop configuration.

TAlk 

Send a message to another user
of the node. The user in question must be in idle state (ie.
not connected/connecting anywhere or running a program).

If the user has
an SSID other than zero, the SSID must be specified. If
multiple users are logged in with the same callsign/SSID
pair, those who are in idle state, get the message.

Users

Show a list of users currently connected to the local
node, where the users are coming from, and what are they
doing at the moment.

ZConnect

Initiate a compressed AX.25, NET/ROM or ROSE connection.
The command arguments are the same as in Connect
command. Note that the other end must be expecting a
compressed connection (a LinuxNode started with the -c
command line option). No negotiation of compression is
done. 

ZTelnet

Initiate a compressed telnet session. The command
arguments are the same as in Telnet command. Note
that the other end must be expecting a compressed connection
(a LinuxNode started with the -c command line option). No
negotiation of compression is done.
