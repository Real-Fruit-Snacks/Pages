NAME

gh-codespace-cp
- Copy files between local and remote file systems

SYNOPSIS

gh codespace
cp [-e] [-r] [-- [...]] ...

DESCRIPTION

The cp
command copies files between the local and remote file
systems.

As with the
UNIX cp command, the first argument specifies the
source and the last specifies the destination; additional
sources may be specified after the first, if the destination
is a directory.

The
--recursive flag is required if any source is a
directory.

A
remote: prefix on any file name argument indicates
that it refers to the file system of the remote (Codespace)
machine. It is resolved relative to the home directory of
the remote user.

By default,
remote file names are interpreted literally. With the
--expand flag, each such argument is treated in the
manner of scp, as a Bash expression to be evaluated
on the remote machine, subject to expansion of tildes,
braces, globs, environment variables, and backticks. For
security, do not use this flag with arguments provided by
untrusted users; see ⟨
https://lwn.net/Articles/835962/⟩ for discussion.

By default, the
cp command will create a public/private ssh key pair
to authenticate with the codespace inside the ~/.ssh
directory.
