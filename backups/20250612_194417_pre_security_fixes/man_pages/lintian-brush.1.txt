NAME

lintian-brush -
automatically fix lintian issues

SYNOPSIS

lintian-brush
[-h] [--no-update-changelog] [--version] [--list-fixers]
[--list-tags] [--diff] [TAGS [TAGS ...]]

DESCRIPTION

lintian-brush
automatically applies a set of fixes for common lintian
issues, adds the relevant changelog entries and commits the
changes to the local version control system.

The
tool’s philosophy is to fix any issues for which it
knows a correct fix, and to back off if it does not.

positional
arguments:

TAGS

Lintian tag for which to apply fixers.

optional
arguments: 
-h, --help

show this help message and
exit

--no-update-changelog

Whether to update the
changelog.

--version

show program’s version
number and exit

--list-fixers

List available fixers.

--list-tags

List lintian tags for which
fixers are available.

--fixers-dir
DIRECTORY

Override the fixers
directory.

--diff

After running all fixers, display the changes made as a
single unified diff.

--modern

Use features that require
packages that are not yet available in Debian stable.

--identity

Print the identity (name and
e-mailaddress) that lintian-brush will use when committing
changes, and exit.

--disable-net-access

Do not attempt to use the
network to e.g. retrieve additional package metadata from
hosting sites, or to check whether a homepage is also
available over HTTPS.

--dry-run

Run fixers but do not actually
make changes to the repository. Useful in particular in
combination with --diff.

Note that this
currently will create a temporary clone of the repository,
which may be slow for large repositories.

--verbose

Be more verbose. For example,
print list of fixers that was run and print tracebacks for
failed fixers.

--uncertain,
--yolo

Make changes with lower certain
than normal. This will potentially fix more issues, but is
more likely to get things wrong. If changes with lower
certainty were made, lintian-brush will let you know in its
output.

--allow-reformatting

Allow reformatting of files
that are being changed, so long as this does not affect the
semantics. This could mean stripping whitespace, but in some
cases could also mean stripping comments.

WRITING AND DEBUGGING FIXERS

Fixer scripts
for lintian-brush can be found under
/usr/share/lintian-brush/fixers.

Lintian-brush
normally takes care of making sure that the working tree
doesn’t contain any pending changes, of reverting
changes when a fixer fails and of committing the changes and
updating debian/changelog if necessary.

However, for
testing purposes, you can also run the scripts directly in a
packaging repository. See
/usr/share/doc/lintian-brush/README.md.gz (section
"Writing new fixers") for details about the
expected behaviour from fixer scripts.

ENVIRONMENT

DEB_UPDATE_CHANGELOG

Used to control whether the
changelog should be updated, depending on whether it is set
to "leave", "update" or
"auto". The --update-changelog and
--no-update-changelog arguments override this.

DEB_COMPAT_RELEASE

Oldest Debian release to stay
compatible with.

UDD_URL

postgresql connection string to
use to connect to UDD. Defaults to the public UDD mirror;
see https://udd-mirror.debian.net/ for details.

EXAMPLES

$
lintian-brush --list-tags

List all lintian tags for which
fixers are available.

$ lintian-brush

Run all fixers in the current
Debian package.
