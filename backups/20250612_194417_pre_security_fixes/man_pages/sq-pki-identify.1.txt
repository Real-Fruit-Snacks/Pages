NAME

sq pki identify
- Identify a certificate

SYNOPSIS

sq pki
identify [OPTIONS] FINGERPRINT|KEYID

DESCRIPTION

Identify a
certificate.

Identify a
certificate by finding authenticated bindings (User ID and
certificate pairs).

If a binding
could be authenticated to the specified level (by default:
fully authenticated, i.e., a trust amount of 120), then the
exit status is 0. Otherwise the exit status is 1.

If a binding
could be partially authenticated (i.e., its trust amount is
greater than 0), then the binding is displayed, even if the
trust is below the specified threshold.

OPTIONS

Subcommand
options 
-a, --amount=AMOUNT

The required amount of
trust.

120 indicates
full authentication; values less than 120 indicate partial
authentication. When ’--certification-network’
is passed, this defaults to 1200, i.e., ’sq pki’
tries to find 10 paths.

--certification-network

Treats the network as a
certification network.

Normally,
’sq pki’ treats the Web of Trust network as an
authentication network where a certification only means that
the binding is correct, not that the target should be
treated as a trusted introducer. In a certification network,
the targets of certifications are treated as trusted
introducers with infinite depth, and any regular expressions
are ignored. Note: The trust amount remains unchanged. This
is how most so-called PGP path-finding algorithms work.

--gossip

Treats all certificates as
unreliable trust roots.

This option is
useful for figuring out what others think about a
certificate (i.e., gossip or hearsay). In other words, this
finds arbitrary paths to a particular certificate.

Gossip is
useful in helping to identify alternative ways to
authenticate a certificate. For instance, imagine Ed wants
to authenticate Laura’s certificate, but asking her
directly is inconvenient. Ed discovers that Micah has
certified Laura’s certificate, but Ed hasn’t yet
authenticated Micah’s certificate. If Ed is willing to
rely on Micah as a trusted introducer, and authenticating
Micah’s certificate is easier than authenticating
Laura’s certificate, then Ed has learned about an
easier way to authenticate Laura’s certificate.

FINGERPRINT|KEYID

The fingerprint or Key ID of
the certificate to authenticate

options

IDs that have that have been certified by anyone.
