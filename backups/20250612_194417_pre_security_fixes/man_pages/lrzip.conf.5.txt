NAME

lrzip.conf -
Configuration File for lrzip

DESCRIPTION

This file if
used, will be read by the lrzip program, parsed, and options
passed to the program. Some options may be overridden on the
command line. Others are fixed.

The
configuration file must be called lrzip.conf. The
lrzip program will search for the file automatically in one
of three places: 
$PWD - Current Directory 
/etc/lrzip 
$HOME/.lrzip

Parameters are
set in PARAMETER=VALUE fashion where any line 
beginning with a # or that is blank will be ignored.

Parameter values are not case sensitive except where
specified.
