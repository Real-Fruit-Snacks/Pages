NAME

pnmcat -
replaced by pamcat

DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

pnmcat
was obsoleted by pamcat(1), introduced with Netpbm
11.00 (September 2022). pamcat is backward compatible
with pnmcat, plus adds many additional functions,
including the ability to process PAM images.

In Netpbm
before 11.00, use the manual for pamcat with
pnmcat. Features that are in pamcat but not
pnmcat are indicated by statements that they
didn’t exist before 11.00.
