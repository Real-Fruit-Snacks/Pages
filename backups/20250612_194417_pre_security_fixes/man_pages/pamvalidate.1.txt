NAME

pamvalidate -
validate Netpbm image format

SYNOPSIS

pamvalidate

DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

pamvalidate
copies a Netpbm image from Standard Input to Standard
Output, except that if there are certain violations of the
image format in the input, pamvalidate fails
without producing any output.

This is most
useful in a pipeline, before a stage you don’t want to
start working on Netpbm input until it knows it can get all
the way through it. For example, assume you are converting
PPM images to PNG and you don’t want to produce a
partial PNG file under any circumstance. If you just use
pnmtopng, and the PPM input is truncated halfway
through the raster, pnmtopng fails, but also produces
about half of a PNG file. To prevent that, pass your PPM
input through pamvalidate on its way to
pnmtopng. Then, pamvalidate will fail, and
consequently the pipeline will fail, before pnmtopng
has seen any input and therefore before pnmtopng has
produced any output.

These are the
kinds of format violations pamvalidate detects:

•

A purported sample value exceeds the declared
maxval. 

•

The stream ends prematurely.

This program
works on multi-image streams, producing a corresponding
output stream.

See
pamfix for a way to salvage an invalid Netpbm image
stream.

OPTIONS

There are no
command line options defined specifically for
pamvalidate, but it recognizes the options common to
all programs based on libnetpbm (See
 Common Options
.)
