Send faxes via E-mail

SYNOPSIS

sendmail
[5558888@fax] 

sendmail
[5558888@fax-lowres] 

sendmail
[5558888@fax-ignore] 

sendmail
[5558888@fax-cover] 

DESCRIPTION

The courierfax
module (if enabled by the system administrator) sends E-mail
messages by fax. Addressing an E-mail message to the address
5558888@fax faxes a printed copy of the message to the
specified phone number.

The ability to
send faxes may be restricted, or not available. The E-mail
message may be a MIME-formatted message. All attachments are
concatenated and sent together in a single fax transmission.
courierfax only knows how to handle certain kinds of
attached. Obviously, trying to fax a voice .mp3 attaching is
not going to work. courierfax knows how to handle plain
text, Postscript, and PDF MIME attachments. courierfax might
also know what to do with other kinds of attachment,
depending on some optional software installed by the system
administrator. courierfax may also be able to read GIF, PNG,
and JPEG images.

Note

Color images are converted to black-and-white.

Images are
faxed with one image per fax page (limiting image sizes to
about 1600x2200).

The message
will be returned as undeliverable if courierfax doesn't know
how to handle a MIME attachment. If the first MIME section
in the E-mail message is plain text, the text appears on the
fax cover page. The sender/recipient information for the
cover page is taken from the message's headers.

The default
courierfax configuration tries to resend the fax for up to
eight hours, after which the message is returned as
undeliverable. The message will also be returned as
undeliverable if the fax transmission is interrupted. The
return bounce will state how many pages were successfully
transmitted.

"@fax"
may also be followed by additional keywords that specify
extra options:

-lowres

Send a low-resolution fax.

-ignore

Ignore any attachment types
that courierfax doesn't understand.

-cover

Send a cover page only. This is
useful in limited situations, with something like this in a
dot-courier(5)
[1]
file:

./Maildir

! 5552222@fax-cover

This
.courier file faxes the contents of a message, sans any
attachments, immediately upon receipt in addition to saving
the message in the mailbox.

FAX TRANSMISSION RECEIPT

The
sender will receive a fax transmission receipt if the sender
requests an ESMTP delivery status notification. This is the
-N option to
sendmail(8)
[2]
:

sendmail
-Nsuccess 5556666@fax 

When
using other mail software, consult the mail software's
documentation for instructions on requesting ESMTP delivery
status notifications.

ADDITIONAL DIALING OPTIONS

courierfax
configurations that are generated by the webadmin
tool for North American environments usually restrict phone
numbers to a standardized ten-digit telephone number, so
that the fax address is always
aaabbbcccc@fax>, and courierfax silently
performs any needed conversion to dial the number (such as
adding “1” or dropping the local
areacode).

It
is also possible to reconfigure courierfax so that it
accepts any telephone string and dials it without any
preprocessing. If so, the address may contain any
combination of digits, letters “A”,
“B”, “C”, and “D”,
representing the four extra dialing tones not normally
accessible from most telephone keypads, the symbols
“*” and “#”, or the following
characters:

W

Most
faxmodems pause and wait for a secondary dialtone, before
dialing the rest of the number.

-

The dash
is replaced by a comma in the dialing string. A comma
results in most faxmodems pausing for two or three seconds
before dialing the rest of the number. It is not possible to
enter a comma directly, because commas are used to separate
multiple E-mail addresses. Use dashes instead of commas in
the dialing string. courierfax replaces all dashes with
commas before dialing the faxmodem.

+

Similarly,
courierfax replaces all pluses with “@”
characters before dialing. An “@” characters
results in most faxmodems waiting for the line to be silent
for five seconds before dialing the rest of the number. It
is not possible to enter a “@” directly as part
of the telephone number itself, for the obvious reasons. Use
pluses instead of “@”s in the dialing string.
courierfax replaces all pluses with “@” before
dialing the faxmodem.

CONFIGURATION

The
slightly arcane configuration file, /etc/courier/faxrc, sets
up which dialing strings are valid. The default
configuration file contains judicious comments that explain
all the parameters, and what they do. The default
configuration file disables courierfax by rejecting all
telephone numbers. The file must be edited in accordance
with the embedded instructions, in order to enable
faxing.

Using
webadmin is highly recommended. Upon demand,
webadmin will install a suitable configuration file
for the North American numbering plan, that receives all
telephone numbers as ten-digit numbers, and adds any
required long distance prefix, or removes the local area
code, as appropriate. Or, webadmin will install a
bare-bones configuration file that dials any requested phone
number, without any editing or transformation.

BUGS

There
is no good way to sleep until a modem lock is released, so
we poll every minute.
