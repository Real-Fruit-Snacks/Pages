XtInitialize(3)           XT COMPATIBILITY FUNCTIONS           XtInitialize(3)

NAME
       XtInitialize - initialize

SYNTAX
       #include <X11/Intrinsic.h>

       Widget XtInitialize(const char *shell_name, const char *applica‐
              tion_class, XrmOptionDescRec* options, Cardinal num_options,
              int* argc, char** argv);

ARGUMENTS
       shell_name
                 Specifies the name of the created shell widget.

       application_class
                 Specifies the class name of this application, which usually
                 is the generic name for all instances of this application.

       options   Specifies how to parse the command line for any application-
                 specific resources.  The options argument is passed as a pa‐
                 rameter to XrmParseCommand.  For further information, see
                 Xlib - C Language X Interface.

       num_options
                 Specifies the number of entries in the options list.

       argc      Specifies a pointer to the number of command line parameters.

       argv      Specifies the command line parameters.

DESCRIPTION
       XtInitialize calls XtToolkitInitialize followed by XtOpenDisplay with
       display_string NULL and application_name NULL, and finally calls XtAp‐
       pCreateShell with application_name NULL, widget_class applicationShell‐
       WidgetClass, and the specified args and num_args and returns the cre‐
       ated shell.  The semantics of calling XtInitialize more than once are
       undefined.  This routine has been replaced by XtAppInitialize.
