NAME

pac —
printer/plotter accounting information

SYNOPSIS

pac [-cmrs]
[-Pprinter] [-pprice]
[user ...]

DESCRIPTION

pac reads the
printer/plotter accounting files, accumulating the number of
pages (the usual case) or feet (for raster devices) of paper
consumed by each named user, and prints out how much
each user consumed in pages or feet and dollars.

When no
user arguments are given, statistics are printed for
every user who has used any paper.

The options are
as follows:

-Pprinter

Accounting is done for the
named printer. Normally, accounting is done for the default
printer (site dependent) or the value of the environment
variable PRINTER is used.

-c

Causes the
output to be sorted by cost; usually the output is sorted
alphabetically by name.

-m

Causes the host
name to be ignored in the accounting file. This allows for a
user on multiple machines to have all of his printing
charges grouped together.

-pprice

The value price is used
for the cost in dollars instead of the default value of 0.02
or the price specified in /etc/printcap.

-r

Reverse the
sorting order.

-s

Accounting
information is summarized on the summary accounting file;
this summarization is necessary since on a busy system, the
accounting file can grow by several lines per day.

OUTPUT FORMAT

pac formats the output
into a simple table, using four columns:

1.

The host name followed by the
user’s login name (column "Login"). If the
-m option was specified, the host name will be
omitted.

2.

The number of pages or feet
printed (column "pages/feet").

3.

The number of copies made
(column "runs").

4.

The total price for the user
(column "price").

If no
user argument was specified, pac will print a
summary line with print totals.
