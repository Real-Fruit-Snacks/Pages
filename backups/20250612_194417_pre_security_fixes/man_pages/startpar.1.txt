startpar [-v]

DESCRIPTION

startpar is
used to run multiple run-level scripts in parallel. The
degree of parallelism on one CPU can be set with the
-p option, the default is full parallelism. An
argument to all of the scripts can be provided with the
-a option. Processes blocked by pending I/O
will cause new process creation to be weighted by the iorate
factor 800. To change this factor the option
-i can be used to specify another value. The
amount

will be subtracted from the
total number of processes which could be started, where
nblocked is the number of processes currently blocked by
pending I/O.

The output of
each script is buffered and written when the script exits,
so output lines of different scripts won’t mix. You
can modify this behaviour by setting a timeout.

The timeout set
with the -t option is used as buffer timeout. If the
output buffer of a script is not empty and the last output
was timeout seconds ago, startpar will flush the
buffer.

The -T
option timeout works more globally. If no output is printed
for more than global_timeout seconds, startpar will
flush the buffer of the script with the oldest output.
Afterwards it will only print output of this script until it
is finished.

When the
-n flag is used, output from a running job is
prefixed with the name of the program or script being
run.

The -M
option switches startpar into a make(1) like
behaviour. This option takes three different arguments:
boot, start, and stop for reading
.depend.boot or .depend.start or
.depend.stop respectively in the directory
/etc/init.d/. By scanning the boot and runlevel
scripts in /etc/init.d/ it then executes the
appropriate scripts in parallel.

The -e
option allows the user to set the location of the
system’s etc configuration directory. The default is
to use /etc. Using -e we can use alternative locations such
as /usr/local/etc.

The -f
option causes startpar to copy standard input (stdin) to
standard output (stdout) until startpar reaches the end of
input or the process is killed. When -f is used no programs
are started and other parameters on the command line are
ignored. This option is only kept for legacy purposes.

The -v
option tells startpar to print its name and version number.
When the version flag is used, all other command line
parameters are ignored. The version number will be printed
and startpar then immediately exits.
