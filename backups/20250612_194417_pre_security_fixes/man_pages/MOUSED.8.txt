DESCRIPTION

The moused utility and
the console driver work together to support mouse operation
in the text console and user programs. They virtualize the
mouse and provide user programs with mouse data in the
standard format (see sysmouse(4)).

The mouse daemon
listens to the specified port for mouse data, interprets and
then passes it via ioctls to the console driver. The mouse
daemon reports translation movement, button press/release
events and movement of the roller or the wheel if available.
The roller/wheel movement is reported as
’’Z’’ axis movement.

The console
driver will display the mouse pointer on the screen and
provide cut and paste functions if the mouse pointer is
enabled in the virtual console via vidcontrol(1). If
sysmouse(4) is opened by the user program, the console
driver also passes the mouse data to the device so that the
user program will see it.

If the mouse
daemon receives the signal SIGHUP, it will reopen the mouse
port and reinitialize itself. Useful if the mouse is
attached/detached while the system is suspended.

The following
options are available:

−3

Emulate the
third (middle) button for 2-button mice. It is emulated by
pressing the left and right physical buttons
simultaneously.

−C
threshold

Set double click speed as the
maximum interval in msec between button clicks. Without this
option, the default value of 500 msec will be assumed. This
option will have effect only on the cut and paste operations
in the text mode console. The user program which is reading
mouse data via sysmouse(4) will not be affected.

−D

Lower DTR on
the serial port. This option is valid only if
mousesystems is selected as the protocol type. The
DTR line may need to be dropped for a 3-button mouse to
operate in the mousesystems mode.

−E
timeout

When the third button emulation
is enabled (see above), the moused utility waits
timeout msec at most before deciding whether two
buttons are being pressed simultaneously. The default
timeout is 100 msec.

−F rate

Set the report rate
(reports/sec) of the device if supported.

−I file

Write the process id of the
moused utility in the specified file. Without this
option, the process id will be stored in
/var/run/moused.pid.

−P

Do not start
the Plug and Play COM device enumeration procedure when
identifying the serial mouse. If this option is given
together with the −i option, the moused
utility will not be able to print useful information for the
serial mouse.

−R

Lower RTS on
the serial port. This option is valid only if
mousesystems is selected as the protocol type by the
−t option below. It is often used with the
−D option above. Both RTS and DTR lines may
need to be dropped for a 3-button mouse to operate in the
mousesystems mode.

−S
baudrate

Select the baudrate for the
serial port (1200 to 9600). Not all serial mice support this
option.

−a
X[,Y]

Accelerate or decelerate the
mouse input. This is a linear acceleration only. Values less
than 1.0 slow down movement, values greater than 1.0 speed
it up. Specifying only one value sets the acceleration for
both axes.

−c

Some mice
report middle button down events as if the left and right
buttons are being pressed. This option handles this.

−d

Enable
debugging messages.

−f

Do not become a
daemon and instead run as a foreground process. Useful for
testing and debugging.

−i info

Print specified information and
quit. Available pieces of information are:

port

Port (device
file) name, i.e. /dev/cuaa0, /dev/mse0 and
/dev/psm0.

if

Interface type:
serial, bus, inport or ps/2.

type

Protocol type.
It is one of the types listed under the −t
option below or sysmouse if the driver supports the
sysmouse data format standard.

model

Mouse model.
The moused utility may not always be able to identify
the model.

all

All of the
above items. Print port, interface, type and model in this
order in one line.

If the
moused utility cannot determine the requested
information, it prints ’’unknown’’
or ’’generic’’.

−l level

Specifies at which level
moused should operate the mouse driver. Refer to
Operation Levels in psm(4) for more information on
this.

−m N=M

Assign the
physical button M to the logical button N. You
may specify as many instances of this option as you like.
More than one physical button may be assigned to a logical
button at the same time. In this case the logical button
will be down, if either of the assigned physical buttons is
held down. Do not put space around ’=’.

−p port

Use port to communicate
with the mouse.

−r
resolution

Set the resolution of the
device; in Dots Per Inch, or low, medium-low,
medium-high or high. This option may not be
supported by all the device.

−s

Select a
baudrate of 9600 for the serial line. Not all serial mice
support this option.

−t type

Specify the protocol type of
the mouse attached to the port. You may explicitly specify a
type listed below, or use auto to let the
moused utility automatically select an appropriate
protocol for the given mouse. If you entirely omit this
option in the command line, −t auto is
assumed. Under normal circumstances, you need to use this
option only if the moused utility is not able to
detect the protocol automatically (see Configuring Mouse
Daemon).

Note that if a
protocol type is specified with this option, the
−P option above is implied and Plug and Play
COM device enumeration procedure will be disabled.

Also note that
if your mouse is attached to the PS/2 mouse port, you should
always choose auto or ps/2, regardless of the
brand and model of the mouse. Likewise, if your mouse is
attached to the bus mouse port, choose auto or
busmouse. Serial mouse protocols will not work with
these mice.

For the USB
mouse, the protocol must be auto. No other protocol
will work with the USB mouse.

Valid types for
this option are listed below.

For the serial
mouse:

microsoft

Microsoft
serial mouse protocol. Most 2-button serial mice use this
protocol.

intellimouse

Microsoft
IntelliMouse protocol. Genius NetMouse, ASCII Mie Mouse,
Logitech MouseMan+ and FirstMouse+ use this protocol too.
Other mice with a roller/wheel may be compatible with this
protocol.

mousesystems

MouseSystems
5-byte protocol. 3-button mice may use this protocol.

mmseries

MM Series mouse
protocol.

logitech

Logitech mouse
protocol. Note that this is for old Logitech models.
mouseman or intellimouse should be specified
for newer models.

mouseman

Logitech
MouseMan and TrackMan protocol. Some 3-button mice may be
compatible with this protocol. Note that MouseMan+ and
FirstMouse+ use intellimouse protocol rather than
this one.

glidepoint

ALPS GlidePoint
protocol.

thinkingmouse

Kensington
ThinkingMouse protocol.

mmhitab

Hitachi tablet
protocol.

x10mouseremote

X10
MouseRemote.

kidspad

Genius Kidspad
and Easypad protocol.

versapad

Interlink
VersaPad protocol.

For the bus and
InPort mouse:

busmouse

This is the
only protocol type available for the bus and InPort mouse
and should be specified for any bus mice and InPort mice,
regardless of the brand.

For the PS/2
mouse:

ps/2

This is the
only protocol type available for the PS/2 mouse and should
be specified for any PS/2 mice, regardless of the brand.

For the USB
mouse, auto is the only protocol type available for
the USB mouse and should be specified for any USB mice,
regardless of the brand.

−w N

Make the
physical button N act as the wheel mode button. While
this button is pressed, X and Y axis movement is reported to
be zero and the Y axis movement is mapped to Z axis. You may
further map the Z axis movement to virtual buttons by the
−z option below.

−z
target

Map Z axis (roller/wheel)
movement to another axis or to virtual buttons. Valid
target maybe:

x 
y

X or Y axis
movement will be reported when the Z axis movement is
detected.

N

Report down
events for the virtual buttons N and N+1
respectively when negative and positive Z axis movement is
detected. There do not need to be physical buttons N
and N+1. Note that mapping to logical buttons is
carried out after mapping from the Z axis movement to the
virtual buttons is done.

N1 N2

Report down events for the
virtual buttons N1 and N2 respectively when
negative and positive Z axis movement is detected.

N1 N2 N3 N4

This is useful for the mouse
with two wheels of which the second wheel is used to
generate horizontal scroll action, and for the mouse which
has a knob or a stick which can detect the horizontal force
applied by the user.

The motion of
the second wheel will be mapped to the buttons N3,
for the negative direction, and N4, for the positive
direction. If the buttons N3 and N4 actually
exist in this mouse, their actions will not be detected.

Note that
horizontal movement or second roller/wheel movement may not
always be detected, because there appears to be no accepted
standard as to how it is encoded.

Note also that
some mice think left is the negative horizontal direction;
others may think otherwise. Moreover, there are some mice
whose two wheels are both mounted vertically, and the
direction of the second vertical wheel does not match the
first one.

Configuring
Mouse Daemon 
The first thing you need to know is the interface type of
the mouse you are going to use. It can be determined by
looking at the connector of the mouse. The serial mouse has
a D-Sub female 9- or 25-pin connector. The bus and InPort
mice have either a D-Sub male 9-pin connector or a round DIN
9-pin connector. The PS/2 mouse is equipped with a small,
round DIN 6-pin connector. Some mice come with adapters with
which the connector can be converted to another. If you are
to use such an adapter, remember the connector at the very
end of the mouse/adapter pair is what matters. The USB mouse
has a flat rectangular connector.

The next thing
to decide is a port to use for the given interface. For the
bus, InPort and PS/2 mice, there is little choice: the bus
and InPort mice always use /dev/mse0, and the PS/2
mouse is always at /dev/psm0. There may be more than
one serial port to which the serial mouse can be attached.
Many people often assign the first, built-in serial port
/dev/cuaa0 to the mouse. You can attach multiple USB
mice to your system or to your USB hub. They are accessible
as /dev/ums0, /dev/ums1, and so on. ~
You may want to create a symbolic link /dev/mouse
pointing to the real port to which the mouse is connected,
so that you can easily distinguish which is your
’’mouse’’ port later.

The next step is
to guess the appropriate protocol type for the mouse. The
moused utility may be able to automatically determine
the protocol type. Run the moused utility with the
−i option and see what it says. If the command
can identify the protocol type, no further investigation is
necessary on your part. You may start the daemon without
explicitly specifying a protocol type (see
EXAMPLES).

The command may
print sysmouse if the mouse driver supports this
protocol type.

Note that the
type and model printed by the −i option do not
necessarily match the product name of the pointing device in
question, but they may give the name of the device with
which it is compatible.

If the
−i option yields nothing, you need to specify a
protocol type to the moused utility by the
−t option. You have to make a guess and try.
There is rule of thumb:

1.

The bus and InPort mice always
use busmouse protocol regardless of the brand of the
mouse.

2.

The ps/2 protocol should
always be specified for the PS/2 mouse regardless of the
brand of the mouse.

3.

You must specify the
auto protocol for the USB mouse.

4.

Most 2-button serial mice
support the microsoft protocol.

5.

3-button serial mice may work
with the mousesystems protocol. If it does not, it
may work with the microsoft protocol although the
third (middle) button will not function. 3-button serial
mice may also work with the mouseman protocol under
which the third button may function as expected.

6.

3-button serial mice may have a
small switch to choose between
’’MS’’ and
’’PC’’, or
’’2’’ and
’’3’’.
’’MS’’ or
’’2’’ usually mean the
microsoft protocol. ’’PC’’ or
’’3’’ will choose the
mousesystems protocol.

7.

If the mouse has a roller or a
wheel, it may be compatible with the intellimouse
protocol.

To test if the
selected protocol type is correct for the given mouse,
enable the mouse pointer in the current virtual console,

vidcontrol -m
on

start the mouse
daemon in the foreground mode,

moused -f -p
_selected_port_ -t _selected_protocol_

and see if the
mouse pointer travels correctly according to the mouse
movement. Then try cut & paste features by clicking the
left, right and middle buttons. Type ^C to stop the
command.

Multiple
Mice 
As many instances of the mouse daemon as the number of mice
attached to the system may be run simultaneously; one
instance for each mouse. This is useful if the user wants to
use the built-in PS/2 pointing device of a laptop computer
while on the road, but wants to use a serial mouse when s/he
attaches the system to the docking station in the office.
Run two mouse daemons and tell the application program (such
as the X Window System) to use sysmouse(4), then the
application program will always see mouse data from either
mouse. When the serial mouse is not attached, the
corresponding mouse daemon will not detect any movement or
button state change and the application program will only
see mouse data coming from the daemon for the PS/2 mouse. In
contrast when both mice are attached and both of them are
moved at the same time in this configuration, the mouse
pointer will travel across the screen just as if movement of
the mice is combined all together.

EXAMPLES

moused -p /dev/cuaa0 -i
type

Let the
moused utility determine the protocol type of the
mouse at the serial port /dev/cuaa0. If successful,
the command will print the type, otherwise it will say
’’unknown’’.

moused -p
/dev/cuaa0 
vidcontrol -m on

If the
moused utility is able to identify the protocol type
of the mouse at the specified port automatically, you can
start the daemon without the −t option and
enable the mouse pointer in the text console as above.

moused -p
/dev/mouse -t microsoft 
vidcontrol -m on

Start the mouse
daemon on the serial port /dev/mouse. The protocol
type microsoft is explicitly specified by the
−t option.

moused -p
/dev/mouse -m 1=3 -m 3=1

Assign the
physical button 3 (right button) to the logical button 1
(logical left) and the physical button 1 (left) to the
logical button 3 (logical right). This will effectively swap
the left and right buttons.

moused -p
/dev/mouse -t intellimouse -z 4

Report negative
Z axis movement (i.e., mouse wheel) as the button 4 pressed
and positive Z axis movement (i.e., mouse wheel) as the
button 5 pressed.

CAVEATS

The moused utility does
not currently work with the alternative console driver
pcvt(4).

Many pad devices
behave as if the first (left) button were pressed if the
user ’taps’ the surface of the pad. In contrast,
some ALPS GlidePoint and Interlink VersaPad models treat the
tapping action as fourth button events. Use the option
’’-m 1=4’’ for these models to
obtain the same effect as the other pad devices.

Cut and paste
functions in the virtual console assume that there are three
buttons on the mouse. The logical button 1 (logical left)
selects a region of text in the console and copies it to the
cut buffer. The logical button 3 (logical right) extends the
selected region. The logical button 2 (logical middle)
pastes the selected text at the text cursor position. If the
mouse has only two buttons, the middle, ’paste’
button is not available. To obtain the paste function, use
the −3 option to emulate the middle button, or
use the −m option to assign the physical right
button to the logical middle button: ’’-m
2=3’’.

STANDARDS

The moused utility
partially supports ’’Plug and Play External COM
Device Specification’’ in order to support PnP
serial mice. However, due to various degrees of conformance
to the specification by existing serial mice, it does not
strictly follow the version 1.0 of the standard. Even with
this less strict approach, it may not always determine an
appropriate protocol type for the given serial mouse.
