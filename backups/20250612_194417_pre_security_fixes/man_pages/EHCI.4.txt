EHCI(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual EHCI(4)

NAME

ehci â€” USB Enhanced
Host Controller driver

SYNOPSIS

device ehci

DESCRIPTION

The ehci driver provides
support for the USB Enhanced Host Controller Interface,
which is used by USB 2.0 controllers.

EHCI controllers
are peculiar in that they can only handle the USB 2.0
protocol. This means that they normally have one or more
companion controllers (i.e., ohci(4) or uhci(4)) handling
USB 1.x devices. Consequently each USB connector is
electrically connected to two USB controllers. The handling
of this is totally automatic, but can be noticed since USB
1.x and USB 2.0 devices plugged in to the same connector
appear to connect to different USB buses.

LOADER TUNABLES

When the kernel has been
compiled with options USB_DEBUG, some tunables become
available that affect the behavior of ehci. These
tunables can be set at the loader(8) prompt before booting
the kernel or stored in loader.conf(5).

hw.usb.ehci.lostintrbug

This tunable enables the lost
interrupt quirk. The default value is 0 (off).

hw.usb.ehci.iaadbug

This tunable enables the EHCI
doorbell quirk. The default value is 0 (off).

hw.usb.ehci.no_hs

This tunable disables USB
devices to attach like HIGH-speed ones and will force all
attached devices to attach to the FULL- or LOW-speed
companion controller. The default value is 0 (off).

SYSCTL VARIABLES

The following variables are
available as both sysctl(8) variables and loader(8)
tunables:

hw.usb.ehci.debug

Debug output level, where 0 is
debugging disabled and larger values increase debug message
verbosity. Default is 0.
