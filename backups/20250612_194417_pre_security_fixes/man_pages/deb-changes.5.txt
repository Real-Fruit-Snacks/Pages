NAME

deb-changes -
Debian changes file format

SYNOPSIS

filename.changes

DESCRIPTION

Each Debian
upload is composed of a .changes control file, which
contains a number of fields. Each field begins with a tag,
such as Source or Binary (case insensitive),
followed by a colon, and the body of the field. Fields are
delimited only by field tags. In other words, field text may
be multiple lines in length, but the installation tools will
generally join lines when processing the body of the field
(except in case of the multiline fields Description,
Changes, Files, Checksums-Sha1 and
Checksums-Sha256, see below).

The control
data might be enclosed in an OpenPGP ASCII
Armored signature, as specified in
RFC4880.

FIELDS

Format:
format-version (required)

The value of this field
declares the format version of the file. The syntax of the
field value is a version number with a major and minor
component. Backward incompatible changes to the format will
bump the major version, and backward compatible changes
(such as field additions) will bump the minor version. The
current format version is 1.8.

Date:
release-date (required)

The date the package was built
or last edited. It must be in the same format as the date in
a deb-changelog(5) entry.

The value of
this field is usually extracted from the
debian/changelog file.

Source:
source-name [(source-version)]
(required)

The name of the source package.
If the source version differs from the binary version, then
the source-name will be followed by a
source-version in parenthesis. This can happen when
the upload is a binary-only non-maintainer upload.

Binary:
binary-package-list (required in context)

This folded field is a
space-separated list of binary packages to upload. If the
upload is source-only, then the field is omitted (since dpkg
1.19.3).

Architecture:
arch-list

Lists the architectures of the
files currently being uploaded. Common architectures are
amd64, armel, i386, etc. Note that the
all value is meant for packages that are architecture
independent. If the source for the package is also being
uploaded, the special entry source is also present.
Architecture wildcards must never be present in the
list.

Version:
version-string (required)

Typically, this is the original
package’s version number in whatever form the
program’s author uses. It may also include a Debian
revision number (for non-native packages). The exact format
and sorting algorithm are described in
deb-version(7).

Distribution:
distributions (required)

Lists one or more
space-separated distributions where this version should be
installed when it is uploaded to the archive.

Urgency: urgency
(recommended)

The urgency of the upload. The
currently known values, in increasing order of urgency, are:
low, medium, high, critical and
emergency.

Maintainer:
fullname-email (required)

Should be in the format
“Joe Bloggs jbloggs [AT] example.org>”, and is
typically the person who created the package, as opposed to
the author of the software that was packaged.

Changed-By:
fullname-email

Should be in the format
“Joe Bloggs jbloggs [AT] example.org>”, and is
typically the person who prepared the package changes for
this release.

Description:
(recommended) 
 binary-package-name -
binary-package-summary

This multiline field contains a
list of binary package names followed by a space, a dash
(’-’) and their possibly truncated short
descriptions. If the upload is source-only, then the field
is omitted (since dpkg 1.19.3).

Closes:
bug-number-list

A space-separated list of bug
report numbers for bug reports that have been resolved with
this upload. The distribution archive software might use
this field to automatically close the referred bug numbers
in the distribution bug tracking system.

Binary-Only: yes

This field denotes that the
upload is a binary-only non-maintainer build. It originates
from the binary-only=yes key/value from the changelog
metadata entry.

Built-For-Profiles:
profile-list

This field specifies a
whitespace separated list of build profiles that this upload
was built with.

Changes: (required) 
 changelog-entries

This multiline field contains
the concatenated text of all changelog entries that are part
of the upload. To make this a valid multiline field empty
lines are replaced with a single full stop (’.’)
and all lines are indented by one space character. The exact
content depends on the changelog format.

Files: (required) 
 md5sum size section priority filename

This multiline field contains a
list of files with an md5sum, size, section and priority for
each one.

The first line
of the field value (the part on the same line as the field
name followed by a colon) is always empty. The content of
the field is expressed as continuation lines, one line per
file. Each line consists of space-separated entries
describing the file: the md5sum, the file size, the file
section, the file priority, and the file name.

This field
lists all files that make up the upload. The list of files
in this field must match the list of files in the other
related Checksums fields.

Checksums-Sha1:
(required) 
Checksums-Sha256: (required) 
 checksum size filename

These multiline fields contain
a list of files with a checksum and size for each one. These
fields have the same syntax and differ only in the checksum
algorithm used: SHA-1 for
Checksums-Sha1 and SHA-256 for
Checksums-Sha256.

The first line
of the field value (the part on the same line as the field
name followed by a colon) is always empty. The content of
the field is expressed as continuation lines, one line per
file. Each line consists of space-separated entries
describing the file: the checksum, the file size, and the
file name.

These fields
list all files that make up the upload. The list of files in
these fields must match the list of files in the
Files field and the other related Checksums
fields.

BUGS

The
Files field is inconsistent with the other
Checksums fields. The Changed-By and
Maintainer fields have confusing names. The
Distribution field contains information about what is
commonly referred to as a suite.
