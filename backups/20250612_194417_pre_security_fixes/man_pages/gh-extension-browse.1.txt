NAME

gh-extension-browse
- Enter a UI for browsing, adding, and removing
extensions

SYNOPSIS

gh extension
browse [flags]

DESCRIPTION

This command
will take over your terminal and run a fully interactive
interface for browsing, adding, and removing gh extensions.
A terminal width greater than 100 columns is
recommended.

To learn how to
control this interface, press ? after running to see
the help text.

Press q
to quit.

Running this
command with --single-column should make this command
more intelligible for users who rely on assistive technology
like screen readers or high zoom.

For a more
traditional way to discover extensions, see:

gh ext
search

along with
gh ext install, gh ext remove, and gh repo
view.

OPTIONS

--debug

log to /tmp/extBrowse-*

of text
