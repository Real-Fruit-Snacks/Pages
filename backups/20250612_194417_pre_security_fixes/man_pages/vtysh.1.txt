NAME

vtysh - an
integrated shell for FRRouting.

SYNOPSIS

vtysh [ -b
]

vtysh [ -E ] [
-d daemon ] [ -c command ]

DESCRIPTION

vtysh is an
integrated shell for the FRRouting suite of protocol
daemons.

OPTIONS

OPTIONS
available for the vtysh command: 
-b, --boot

Execute boot startup
configuration. It makes sense only if integrated config file
is in use (not default in FRRouting). See Info file frr for
more info.

-c, --command
command

Specify command to be executed
under batch mode. It behaves like -c option in any other
shell - command is executed and vtysh exits.

It's useful for
gathering info from FRRouting daemons or reconfiguring
daemons from inside shell scripts, etc. Note that multiple
commands may be executed by using more than one -c option
and/or embedding linefeed characters inside the command
string.

-d, --daemon
daemon_name

Specify which daemon to connect
to. By default, vtysh attempts to connect to all FRRouting
daemons running on the system. With this flag, one can
specify a single daemon to connect to instead. For example,
specifying '-d ospfd' will connect only to ospfd. This can
be particularly useful inside scripts with -c where the
command is targeted for a single daemon.

-e, --execute
command

Alias for -c. It's here only
for compatibility with Zebra routing software and older FRR
versions. This will be removed in future.

-E, --echo

When the -c option is being
used, this flag will cause the standard vtysh prompt and
command to be echoed prior to displaying the results. This
is particularly useful to separate the results when
executing multiple commands.

-C, --dryrun

When the -C option is being
used, this flag will check the config for syntatic
validity.

-m, --markfile

Mark the input file with
context ends, useful for cleanup of a config file that has a
lot of extraneous space and end markers

-n, --noerror

When executing cli that does
not invoke a vtysh shell, if an error ocurrs ignore it for
purposes of return codes from vtysh.

-H, --histfile

Override the history file for
vtysh commands. You can set vtysh -H /dev/null to
turn logging of at all.

-u, --user

Restrict access to
configuration commands by preventing use of the
"enable" command. This option provides the same
limited "security" as password-protected telnet
access. This security should not be relied on in
production environments.

Caveat emptor:
VTYSH was never designed to be a privilege broker and is not
built using secure coding practices. No guarantees of
security are provided for this option and under no
circumstances should this option be used to provide any
semblance of secure read-only access to FRR.

-h, --help

Display a usage message on
standard output and exit.

-t, --timestamp

Print a timestamp before going
to shell or reading the configuration file.

--no-fork

When used in conjunction with
-b, prevents vtysh from forking children to handle
configuring each target daemon.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

VTYSH_PAGER

This should be the name of the
pager to use. Default is more.

VTYSH_HISTFILE

Override the history file for
vtysh commands. Logging can be turned off using
VTYSH_HISTFILE=/dev/null vtysh. Environment is
preferred way to override the history file path over command
line argument (-H/--histfile).

FILES

/usr/lib/frr/vtysh

The default location of the
vtysh binary.

/etc/frr/vtysh.conf

The default location of the
vtysh config file.

/etc/frr/frr.conf

The default location of the
integrated FRRouting routing engine config file if
integrated config file is in use.

${HOME}/.history_frr

Location of history of commands
entered via cli

$(PWD)/vtysh.log

If the vtysh process is
configured to output logs to a file, then you will find this
file in the directory where you started vtysh.

WARNING

This man page
is intended to be a quick reference for command line
options. The definitive document is the info file frr latest
or the documentation available on the project website at -

DIAGNOSTICS

The daemon may
log to standard output, to a VTY, to a log file, or through
syslog to the system logs. FRR supports many debugging
options, see the Info file, web docs or source for
details.
