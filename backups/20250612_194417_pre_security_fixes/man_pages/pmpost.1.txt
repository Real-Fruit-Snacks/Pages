NAME

pmpost -
append messages to the Performance Co-Pilot notice board

SYNOPSIS

$PCP_BINADM_DIR/pmpost
message

DESCRIPTION

pmpost
will append the text message to the end of the
Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) notice board file
($PCP_LOG_DIR/NOTICES) in an atomic manner that
guards against corruption of the notice board file by
concurrent invocations of pmpost.

The PCP notice
board is intended to be a persistent store and clearing
house for important messages relating to the operation of
the PCP and the notification of performance alerts from
pmie(1) when other notification options are either
unavailable or unsuitable.

Before being
written, messages are prefixed by the current time, and when
the current day is different to the last time the notice
board file was written, pmpost will prepend the
message with the full date.

If the notice
board file does not exist, pmpost will create it.
pmpost would usually run from long-running PCP
daemons executing under the (typically unprivileged)
$PCP_USER and $PCP_GROUP accounts. The file
should be owned and writable by the $PCP_USER user,
and readable by others.
