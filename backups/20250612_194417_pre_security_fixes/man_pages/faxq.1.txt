NAME

faxq - display
fax jobs queued by faxspool(1)

SYNOPSIS

faxq
[] [-osa] [-v]
[-r] [-rall]
[-P]

DESCRIPTION

Display the fax
queue set up by faxspool(1).

faxq
looks for all the jobs queued by faxspool(1) to
/var/spool/fax/outgoing/*. For each job in the queue,
faxq displays some status informations about it. If
no options are specified, one line per queued fax job is
printed, displaying the job number, sender, number of pages
and target fax number.

COMMANDS

faxq
stop stops the fax queue processing by creating the file
/var/spool/fax/outgoing/stop. This command works only if you
have write access to the spool directory. Depending on local
setup, this means ’’root only’’ or
’’fax administrator group’’. If you
don’t have write access, an error message is
printed.

faxq
start re-starts a previously stopped fax queue, by
removing the ’’stop’’ file. As for
faxq stop this only works if you have write
access.

OPTIONS

-v

Tells faxq to print a
more verbose report for each job (multiple lines).

-o

Show old jobs, already sent but still in the queue
directory, too.

-s

Show suspended jobs (stopped because of too many fatal
errors during sending). You can restart those jobs with
faxq -r 

-a

Show all jobs (active, old, suspended).

-r 

Restart job with the given
ID(s) ("-r F012345" or "-r
F01234*").

-r all

Restart ALL suspended jobs. Every suspended job in the
queue (that you have write permissions for) will be
requeued. Use faxrm to delete jobs that you do not
want to be sent!

-P 

Change the priority of fax job
 to . Example: "faxq -P F000247
3".

BUGS

faxq
doesn’t handle time scheduling yet.

faxq -P
is currently broken (needs re-implementing with
faxq-helper).
