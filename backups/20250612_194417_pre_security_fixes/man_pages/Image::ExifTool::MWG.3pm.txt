NAME
       Image::ExifTool::MWG - Metadata Working Group support

SYNOPSIS
           # enable MWG Composite tags
           use Image::ExifTool::MWG;
           Image::ExifTool::MWG::Load();

           # enable MWG strict mode
           $Image::ExifTool::MWG::strict = 1;

           # disable MWG strict mode
           $Image::ExifTool::MWG::strict = 0;

DESCRIPTION
       The MWG module contains Composite tag definitions which are designed to
       simplify implementation of the Metadata Working Group guidelines.
       These special MWG Composite tags are enabled by calling the Load()
       method:

           use Image::ExifTool::MWG;
           Image::ExifTool::MWG::Load();

       By default, loading the MWG Composite tags enables "strict MWG
       conformance" unless previously enabled or disabled by the user.  In
       this mode, ExifTool will generate a Warning instead of extracting EXIF,
       IPTC and XMP from non-standard locations.  The strict mode may be
       disabled or enabled at any time by setting the MWG "strict" flag to 0
       or 1.  eg)

           $Image::ExifTool::MWG::strict = 0;

       This module also contains the MWG XMP tags which are loaded
       automatically by ExifTool as required, and are independent of the MWG
       Composite tags which must be loaded explicitly as described above.
