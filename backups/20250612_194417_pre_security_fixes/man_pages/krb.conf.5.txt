NAME

krb.conf -
Configures the kerberos realm to AFS cell mapping

DESCRIPTION

/etc/openafs/server/krb.conf
is an optional file that resides on an OpenAFS server and is
used to specify which Kerberos5 realms are trusted to
authenticate to the local AFS cell. The
format of the file is one or more realms separated by white
space on the first line of the file. If the Kerberos5 realm
matches the AFS cell name (case-insensitive),
then this file can be omitted. krb.conf is only needed when
the Kerberos5 realm does not match the cell name or multiple
Kerberos5 realms authenticate to the same AFS
cell.
