NAME

sd_bus_message_sensitive
- Mark a message object as containing sensitive data

SYNOPSIS

#include

int
sd_bus_message_sensitive(sd_bus_message *message); 

DESCRIPTION

sd_bus_message_sensitive()
marks an allocated bus message as containing sensitive data.
This ensures that the message data is carefully removed from
memory (specifically, overwritten with zero bytes) when
released. It is recommended to mark all incoming and
outgoing messages like this that contain security
credentials and similar data that should be dealt with
carefully. Note that it is not possible to unmark messages
like this, it's a one way operation. If a message is already
marked sensitive and then marked sensitive a second time the
message remains marked so and no further operation is
executed.

As a safety
precaution all messages that are created as reply to
messages that are marked sensitive are also implicitly
marked so.

RETURN VALUE

On success,
this functions return 0 or a positive integer. On failure,
it returns a negative errno-style error code.

Errors

Returned errors may indicate the following problems:

-EINVAL

The message parameter is
NULL.

Added in
version 245.

NOTES

Functions
described here are available as a shared library, which can
be compiled against and linked to with the
libsystemd pkg-config(1) file.

The code
described here uses getenv(3), which is declared to
be not multi-thread-safe. This means that the code calling
the functions described here must not call setenv(3)
from a parallel thread. It is recommended to only do calls
to setenv() from an early phase of the program when
no other threads have been started.
