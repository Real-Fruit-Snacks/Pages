DESCRIPTION

synaptics
is an Xorg input driver for touchpads. Even though touchpads
can be handled by the normal evdev or mouse drivers, this
driver allows more advanced features of the touchpad to
become available. Some benefits would be:

•

Movement with adjustable, non-linear acceleration and
speed. 

•

Button events through short touching of the
touchpad. 

•

Double-Button events through double short touching of
the touchpad.

•

Dragging through short touching and holding down the
finger on the touchpad (tap-and-drag gesture).

•

Middle and right button events on the upper and lower
corner of the touchpad.

•

Vertical scrolling (button four and five events) through
moving the finger on the right side of the touchpad.

•

The up/down button sends button four/five events.

•

Horizontal scrolling (button six and seven events)
through moving the finger on the lower side of the
touchpad. 

•

The multi-buttons send button four/five events for
vertical scrolling and button six/seven events for
horizontal scrolling.

•

Adjustable finger detection.

•

Multifinger taps: two finger for right button and three
finger for middle button events. (Needs hardware support.
Not all models implement this feature.)

•

Pressure-dependent motion speed.

Note that
depending on the touchpad firmware, some of these features
might be available even without using the synaptics driver.
Note also that some functions are not available on all
touchpad models, because they need support from the touchpad
hardware/firmware. (Multifinger taps for example.)

The name
"synaptics" is historical and the driver still
provides the synaptics protocol parsing code. Under Linux
however, the hardware-specifics are handled by the kernel
and this driver will work for any touchpad that has a
working kernel driver. If your device is recognized as
"PS/2 Mouse" or similar, the kernel driver does
not support your device and this driver will only provide
limited functionality.

Option
"GrabEventDevice"
"boolean"

If GrabEventDevice is true, the
driver will grab the event device for exclusive use when
using the linux 2.6 event protocol. When using other
protocols, this option has no effect. Grabbing the event
device means that no other user space or kernel space
program sees the touchpad events. This is desirable if the X
config file includes /dev/input/mice as an input device, but
is undesirable if you want to monitor the device from user
space. When changing this parameter with the synclient
program, the change will not take effect until the synaptics
driver is disabled and re-enabled. This can be achieved by
switching to a text console and then switching back to
X.

Option
"TapAndDragGesture"
"boolean"

Switch on/off the tap-and-drag
gesture. This gesture is an alternative way of dragging. It
is performed by tapping (touching and releasing the finger),
then touching again and moving the finger on the touchpad.
The gesture is enabled by default and can be disabled by
setting the TapAndDragGesture option to false. Property:
"Synaptics Gestures"

Option
"VertResolution"
"integer"

Resolution of X coordinates in
units/millimeter. The value is used together with
HorizResolution to compensate unequal vertical and
horizontal sensitivity. Setting VertResolution and
HorizResolution equal values means no compensation. Default
value is read from the touchpad or set to 1 if value could
not be read. Property: "Synaptics Pad
Resolution"

Option
"HorizResolution"
"integer"

Resolution of Y coordinates in
units/millimeter. The value is used together with
VertResolution to compensate unequal vertical and horizontal
sensitivity. Setting VertResolution and HorizResolution
equal values means no compensation. Default value is read
from the touchpad or set to 1 if value could not be read.
Property: "Synaptics Pad Resolution"

Option
"AreaLeftEdge"
"integer"

Ignore movements, scrolling and
tapping which start left of this edge. The option is
disabled by default and can be enabled by setting the
AreaLeftEdge option to any integer value other than zero. If
supported by the server (version 1.9 and later), the edge
may be specified in percent of the total width of the
touchpad. Property: "Synaptics Area"

Option
"AreaRightEdge"
"integer"

Ignore movements, scrolling and
tapping which start right of this edge. The option is
disabled by default and can be enabled by setting the
AreaRightEdge option to any integer value other than zero.
If supported by the server (version 1.9 and later), the edge
may be specified in percent of the total width of the
touchpad. Property: "Synaptics Area"

Option
"AreaTopEdge"
"integer"

Ignore movements, scrolling and
tapping which start above this edge. The option is disabled
by default and can be enabled by setting the AreaTopEdge
option to any integer value other than zero. If supported by
the server (version 1.9 and later), the edge may be
specified in percent of the total height of the touchpad.
Property: "Synaptics Area"

Option
"AreaBottomEdge"
"integer"

Ignore movements, scrolling and
tapping which start below this edge. The option is disabled
by default and can be enabled by setting the AreaBottomEdge
option to any integer value other than zero. If supported by
the server (version 1.9 and later), the edge may be
specified in percent of the total height of the touchpad.
Property: "Synaptics Area"

Option
"SoftButtonAreas" "RBL RBR RBT RBB MBL
MBR MBT MBB"

This option is only available
on ClickPad devices. Enable soft button click area support
on ClickPad devices. The first four parameters are the left,
right, top, bottom edge of the right button, respectively,
the second four parameters are the left, right, top, bottom
edge of the middle button, respectively. Any of the values
may be given as percentage of the touchpad width or height,
whichever applies. If any edge is set to 0 (not 0%), the
button is assumed to extend to infinity in the given
direction. Setting all values to 0 (not 0%) disables soft
button areas. Button areas may not overlap, however it is
permitted for two buttons to share an edge value. Property:
"Synaptics Soft Button Areas"

Option
"HasSecondarySoftButtons"
"boolean"

This option is only available
on ClickPad devices. Enable the secondary software button
area support. The exact area must be set in option
"SecondarySoftButtonAreas". See ClickPad
support for more details.

Option
"SecondarySoftButtonAreas" "RBL RBR
RBT RBB MBL MBR MBT MBB"

This option is only available
on ClickPad devices and only if Option
"HasSecondarySoftButtons" is enabled. Define
the secondary soft button click areas on ClickPad devices
(usually on top of the device). For the allowed values for
this option, see Option "SoftButtonAreas".
Primary and secondary soft button areas must not overlap
each other. If they do, the behavior of the driver is
undefined. Property: "Synaptics Secondary Soft Button
Areas". This property is only initialized if Option
"HasSecondarySoftButtons" is enabled and this
option is set in the xorg.conf(5).

CONFIGURATION DETAILS

Area
handling 
The LeftEdge, RightEdge, TopEdge and BottomEdge parameters
are used to define the edge and corner areas of the
touchpad. The parameters split the touchpad area in 9
pieces, like this:

Coordinates to
the left of LeftEdge are part of the left edge (areas 1, 4
and 7), coordinates to the left of LeftEdge and above
TopEdge (area 1) are part of the upper left corner, etc.

A good way to
find appropriate edge parameters is to use evtest(1) on the
device to see the x/y coordinates corresponding to different
positions on the touchpad.

The perceived
physical edges may be adjusted with the AreaLeftEdge,
AreaRightEdge, AreaTopEdge, and AreaBottomEdge options. If
these values are set to something other than the physical
edges, input that starts in the space between the area edge
and the respective physical edge is ignored. Note that this
reduces the available space on the touchpad to start motions
in.

Tapping

A tap event happens when the finger is touched and released
in a time interval shorter than MaxTapTime, and the touch
and release coordinates are less than MaxTapMove units
apart. A "touch" event happens when the Z value
goes above FingerHigh, and an "untouch" event
happens when the Z value goes below FingerLow.

The
MaxDoubleTapTime parameter has the same function as the
MaxTapTime parameter, but for the second, third, etc tap in
a tap sequence. If you can’t perform double clicks
fast enough (for example, xmms depends on fast double
clicks), try reducing this parameter. If you can’t get
word selection to work in xterm (ie button down, button up,
button down, move mouse), try increasing this parameter.

The ClickTime
parameter controls the delay between the button down and
button up X events generated in response to a tap event. A
too long value can cause undesirable autorepeat in scroll
bars and a too small value means that visual feedback from
the gui application you are interacting with is harder to
see.

Acceleration

The MinSpeed, MaxSpeed and AccelFactor parameters control
the pointer motion speed. The speed value defines the
scaling between touchpad coordinates and screen coordinates.
When moving the finger very slowly, the MinSpeed value is
used, when moving very fast the MaxSpeed value is used. When
moving the finger at moderate speed, you get a pointer
motion speed somewhere between MinSpeed and MaxSpeed. If you
don’t want any acceleration, set MinSpeed and MaxSpeed
to the same value.

The MinSpeed,
MaxSpeed and AccelFactor parameters don’t have any
effect on scrolling speed. Scrolling speed is determined
solely from the VertScrollDelta and HorizScrollDelta
parameters. To invert the direction of vertical or
horizontal scrolling, set VertScrollDelta or
HorizScrollDelta to a negative value.

Acceleration is
mostly handled outside the driver, thus the driver will
translate MinSpeed into constant deceleration and adapt
MaxSpeed at startup time. This ensures you can user the
other acceleration profiles, albeit without pressure motion.
However the numbers at runtime will likely be different from
any options you may have set.

Pressure
motion 
When pressure motion is activated, the cursor motion speed
depends on the pressure exerted on the touchpad (the more
pressure exerted on the touchpad, the faster the pointer).
More precisely the speed is first calculated according to
MinSpeed, MaxSpeed and AccelFactor, and then is multiplied
by a sensitivity factor.

The sensitivity
factor can be adjusted using the PressureMotion parameters.
If the pressure is below PressureMotionMinZ,
PressureMotionMinFactor is used, and if the pressure is
greater than PressureMotionMaxZ, PressureMotionMaxFactor is
used. For a pressure value between PressureMotionMinZ and
PressureMotionMaxZ, the factor is increased linearly.

Middle
button emulation 
Since most synaptics touchpad models don’t have a
button that corresponds to the middle button on a mouse, the
driver can emulate middle mouse button events. If you press
both the left and right mouse buttons at almost the same
time (no more than EmulateMidButtonTime milliseconds apart)
the driver generates a middle mouse button event.

Circular
scrolling 
Circular scrolling acts like a scrolling wheel on the
touchpad. Scrolling is engaged when a drag starts in the
given CircScrollTrigger region, which can be all edges, a
particular side, or a particular corner. Once scrolling is
engaged, moving your finger in clockwise circles around the
center of the touchpad will generate scroll down events and
counter clockwise motion will generate scroll up events.
Lifting your finger will disengage circular scrolling. Use
tight circles near the center of the pad for fast scrolling
and large circles for better control. When used together
with vertical scrolling, hitting the upper or lower right
corner will seamlessly switch over from vertical to circular
scrolling.

Coasting

Coasting is enabled by setting the CoastingSpeed parameter
to a non-zero value. Coasting comes in two flavors:
conventional (finger off) coasting, and corner (finger on)
coasting.

Conventional
coasting is enabled when coasting is enabled, and
CornerCoasting is set to false. When conventional coasting
is enabled, horizontal/vertical scrolling can continue after
the finger is released from the lower/right edge of the
touchpad. The driver computes the scrolling speed
corresponding to the finger speed immediately before the
finger leaves the touchpad. If this scrolling speed is
larger than the CoastingSpeed parameter (measured in scroll
events per second), the scrolling will continue with the
same speed in the same direction until the finger touches
the touchpad again.

Corner coasting
is enabled when coasting is enabled, and CornerCoasting is
set to true. When corner coasting is enabled, edge scrolling
can continue as long as the finger stays in a corner.
Coasting begins when the finger enters the corner, and
continues until the finger leaves the corner. CornerCoasting
takes precedence over the seamless switch from edge
scrolling to circular scrolling. That is, if CornerCoasting
is active, scrolling will stop, and circular scrolling will
not start, when the finger leaves the corner.

Noise
cancellation 
The synaptics has a built-in noise cancellation based on
hysteresis. This means that incoming coordinates actually
shift a box of predefined dimensions such that it covers the
incoming coordinate, and only the boxes own center is used
as input. Obviously, the smaller the box the better, but the
likelihood of noise motion coming through also
increases.

ClickPad
support 
A click pad device has button(s) integrated into the
touchpad surface. The user must press downward on the
touchpad in order to generated a button press. ClickPad
support is enabled if the option ClickPad is set or
the property is set at runtime. On some platforms, this
option will be set automatically if the kernel detects a
matching device. On Linux, the device must have the
INPUT_PROP_BUTTONPAD property set.

ClickPads do
not support middle mouse button emulation. If enabling
ClickPad support at runime, the user must also set the
middle mouse button timeout to 0. If auto-detected, middle
mouse button emulation is disabled by the driver.

ClickPads
provide software emulated buttons through Option
"SoftButtonAreas". These buttons enable areas
on the touchpad to perform as right or middle mouse button.
When the user performs a click within a defined soft button
area, a right or middle click is performed.

Some laptops,
most notably the Lenovo T440, T540 and x240 series, provide
a pointing stick without physical buttons. On those laptops,
the top of the touchpad acts as software-emulated button
area. This area can be enabled with Option
"HasSecondarySoftButtons" and configured with
Option "SecondarySoftButtonAreas". On some
platforms, this option will be set automatically if the
kernel detects a matching device. On Linux, the device must
have the INPUT_PROP_TOPBUTTONPAD property set.

32 bit unsigned, 2 values
(read-only), vertical, horizontal in units/millimeter.

NOTES

Configuration
through InputClass sections is recommended in X
servers 1.8 and later. See xorg.conf.d(5) for more details.
An example xorg.conf.d snippet is provided in
${sourcecode}/conf/70-synaptics.conf

Configuration
through hal fdi files is recommended in X servers 1.5, 1.6
and 1.7. An example hal policy file is provided in
${sourcecode}/conf/11-x11-synaptics.fdi

If either of
Protocol "auto-dev" (default)
or Protocol "event" is used,
the driver initializes defaults based on the capabilities
reported by the kernel driver. Acceleration, edges and
resolution are based on the dimensions reported by the
kernel. If the kernel reports multi-finger detection,
two-finger vertical scrolling is enabled, horizontal
two-finger scrolling is disabled and edge scrolling is
disabled. If no multi-finger capabilities are reported, edge
scrolling is enabled for both horizontal and vertical
scrolling. Tapping is disabled by default for touchpads with
one or more physical buttons. To enable it you need to map
tap actions to buttons. See the "TapButton1",
"TapButton2" and "TapButton3"
options.

Button mapping
for physical buttons is handled in the server. If the device
is switched to left-handed (an in-server mapping of physical
buttons 1, 2, 3 to the logical buttons 3, 2, 1,
respectively), both physical and TapButtons are affected. To
counteract this, the TapButtons need to be set up in reverse
order (TapButton1=3, TapButton2=1).
