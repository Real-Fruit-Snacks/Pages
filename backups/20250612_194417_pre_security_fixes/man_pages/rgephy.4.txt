RGEPHY(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual RGEPHY(4)

NAME

rgephy â€” RealTek
RTL8168/8169/8110/8211 series 10/100/1000 Gigabit Ethernet
PHY driver

SYNOPSIS

To compile all available PHY
drivers into the kernel, place the following line in your
kernel configuration file:

device
miibus

Alternatively,
to selectively compile this driver into the kernel, place
the following lines in your kernel configuration file
instead:

device mii

device rgephy

DESCRIPTION

The rgephy driver
supports the RealTek RTL8168, RTL8169, RTL8110 and RTL8211
series integrated 10/100/1000 Gigabit Ethernet PHYs.

In order to get
a list of media types and options supported by a specific
instance of the rgephy driver, run ifconfig -m on the
instance of its parent MAC driver.

Additionally,
the rgephy driver supports the following special
media option:

flag0

When manually
setting media type and options via ifconfig(8), the
rgephy driver by default also triggers an
autonegotiation advertising the selected media. This is done
in order to work around hardware issues in certain
scenarios. It is believed that this behavior does not cause
harm in general but in fact can have an adverse effect in
edge cases. In order to manually set the media type and
options without also triggering an autonegotiation, the
rgephy driver allows to turn this behavior off via
the flag0 media option.

Note that this
special media option will not show up in the output of
ifconfig(8), even when set.

EXAMPLES

Manually set 100BASE-TX
full-duplex without also triggering an autonegotiation:

ifconfig re0
media 100baseTX mediaopt full-duplex,flag0
