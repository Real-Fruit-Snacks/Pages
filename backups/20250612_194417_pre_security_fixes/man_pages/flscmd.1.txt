NAME

flscmd, fls
− list the contents of a FSP database

SYNOPSIS

flscmd [
unix ls flags ] filename ...

fls [
unix ls flags ] filename ...

DESCRIPTION

flscmd
lists the content of the FSP database. All usual flags and
usages for the unix ls command are accepted.

flscmd
will perform csh file name globbing based on file and
directory information obtained from the FSP database.

Since
user’s command shells generally cannot do the proper
globbing for this program, it is recommended that user
defines a shell alias or function to turn off command shell
globbing before running this program. csh
example:

alias fls \(set
noglob\; exec flscmd \!\*\)

ENVIRONMENT

See fsp_env(7)
for list of used environment variables.

BUGS

flscmd
is based on 4.3 ls code. It inherits any bugs found
in 4.3 ls. In addition, only four pieces of
information for each file and directory are available
through FSP: name, time, size, and type. All
other information that flscmd display are for
compatibility purposes only and are forged locally.
