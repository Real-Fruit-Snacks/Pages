NAME

gtags - create
tag files for global

SYNOPSIS

gtags
[-ciIOqvw][-C dir][-d tag-file][-f
file][dbpath]

DESCRIPTION

Gtags is
used to create tag files for global(1).

Gtags
recursively collects source files under the current
directory, picks up symbols and writes the cross-reference
data into the tag files (´GTAGS´,
´GRTAGS´ and ´GPATH´).

By default,
gtags picks up C, Yacc, assembly language, Java, C++
and PHP source files. Files whose names end in
´.c´, ´.h´ are assumed to be C
source files. Files whose names end in ´.y´ are
assumed to be Yacc source files. Files whose names end in
´.s´, ´.S´ are assumed to be
assembly language source files. Files whose names end in
´.java´ are assumed to be Java source files.
Files whose names end in ´.c++´,
´.cc´, ´.hh´, ´.cpp´,
´.cxx´, ´.hxx´, ´.hpp´,
´.C´, ´.H´ are assumed to be C++
source files. Files whose names end in ´.php´,
´.php3´, ´.phtml´ are assumed to be
PHP source files. Other files are assumed to be text files.
Gtags does not treat binary files.

If
´gtags.files´ exists in the current directory or
a file is specified by the -f option, target files
are limited by it. Lines starting with ´. ´ are
comments.

OPTIONS

The following
options are available: 
--accept-dotfiles

Accept files and directories
whose names begin with a dot. By default, gtags
ignores them.

-c, --compact

Make ´GTAGS´ in
compact format. This option does not influence
´GRTAGS´, because that is always made in compact
format.

-C, --directory
dir

Change the directory before
doing all the work including parameter analysis. This option
is ignored in GTAGS_OPTIONS. Please specify it on the
command line directly.

--config[=name]

Print the value of config
variable name. If name is not specified then
print all names and values. Additionally, you can refer to
the directory name where the system is installed as read
only variables: bindir, libdir,
datadir, localstatedir and
sysconfdir.

-d, --dump
tag-file

Dump a tag file as text to the
standard output. Output format is
´keydata’. This is for debugging.

--explain

Explain handling files.

-f, --file
file

Give a list of candidates of
target files. Files which are not on the list are ignored.
The argument file can be set to ´-´ to
accept a list of files from the standard input. File names
must be separated by newline. To make the list you may use
find(1), which has rich options for selecting
files.

--gtagsconf
file

Set environment variable
GTAGSCONF to file.

--gtagslabel
label

Set environment variable
GTAGSLABEL to label.

--help

Print a usage message.

-I, --idutils

In addition to tag files, make
ID database for idutils(1).

-i,
--incremental

Update tag files incrementally.
It’s better to use global(1) with the -u
command.

-O, --objdir

Use BSD-style obj directory as
the location of tag files. If GTAGSOBJDIRPREFIX is
set and ´$GTAGSOBJDIRPREFIX´ directory exists,
gtags creates ´$GTAGSOBJDIRPREFIX/´ directory and makes tag files in it.
Though you can use MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX instead of
GTAGSOBJDIRPREFIX, it is deprecated. If dbpath
is specified, this option is ignored.

--single-update
file

Update tag files for a single
file. It is considered that file was added, updated
or deleted, and there is no change in other files. This
option implies the -i option.

--skip-unreadable

Skip unreadable files.

--skip-symlink
[=type]

Skip symbolic links. If
type is ’f’ then skip only symbolic links
for file, else if ’d’ then skip only symbolic
links for directory. The default value of type is
’a’ (all symbolic links).

--sqlite3

Use Sqlite 3 API to make tag
files. By default, BSD/DB 1.85 API is used. To use this
option, you need to invoke configure script with
--with-sqlite3 in the build phase.

--statistics

Print statistics
information.

-q, --quiet

Quiet mode.

-v, --verbose

Verbose mode.

--version

Show version number.

-w, --warning

Print warning messages.

dbpath

The directory in which tag files are generated. The
default is the current directory.

EXAMPLES

$ ls -F 
Makefile src/ lib/ 
$ gtags -v 
$ global -x main 
main 10 src/main.c main (argc, argv) {

FILES

´GTAGS´

Tag file for definitions.

´GRTAGS´

Tag file for references.

´GPATH´

Tag file for source files.

´gtags.conf´,
´$HOME/.globalrc´

Configuration data for GNU
Global. See gtags.conf(5).

´gtags.files´

The list of candidates of
target files.

´.notfunction´

The list of symbols which is
not a definition. If this file exists in the project root
directory, gtags does not regard the symbols listed
in this file as definitions. Lines starting with
’;’ are comment lines.

ENVIRONMENT

The following
environment variables affect the execution of gtags:

GTAGSCACHE

The size of the B-tree cache.
The default is 50000000 (bytes).

GTAGSCONF

Configuration file.

GTAGSFORCECPP

If this variable is set, each
file whose suffix is ´.h´ is forcibly parsed by
the built-in C++ parser. Do not set this variable if you are
using plug-in parsers. This variable and the built-in C++
parser are deprecated.

GTAGSFORCEENDBLOCK

If this variable is set, each }
at the first column brings end of block of 0 level.

GTAGSLABEL

Configuration label. The
default is ´default´.

GTAGSLOGGING

If this variable is set,
´$GTAGSLOGGING´ is used as the path name of a
log file. There is no default value.

GTAGS_COMMANDLINE

This variable can only be
referenced from the hook (see gtags_hook). Gtags sets
its own effective command line to this variable before
calling the hook. Each argument is separated by whitespace,
and real whitespace is represented as ’%20’.
This is read only.

GTAGS_OPTIONS

The value of this variable is
inserted in the head of arguments.

GTAGSOBJDIR

If this variable is set, it is
used as the name of BSD-style objdir. The default is
´obj´. Though you can use MAKEOBJDIR
instead of GTAGSOBJDIR, it is deprecated.

GTAGSOBJDIRPREFIX

If this variable is set, it is
used as the prefix of BSD-style objdir. The default is
´/usr/obj´. Though you can use
MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX instead of GTAGSOBJDIRPREFIX,
it is deprecated.

TMPDIR

The location used to stored temporary files. The default
is ´/tmp´.

CONFIGURATION

The following
configuration variables affect the execution of
gtags. You can see the default value for each
variable with the --config option. 
gtags_parser (comma separated list)

Specify the mapping of language
names and plug-in parsers. Each part delimited by the comma
consists of a language name, a colon, the shared object
path, an optional colon followed by a function name. If the
function name is not specified, ’parser’ is
assumed. As a special exception, gtags collects
values from multiple gtags_parser variables. For these
mappings, the first match is adopted.

gtags_hook (command line)

Specify a command line which
should be executed at the beginning of gtags after
loading configuration file. You can use this hook to update
´gtags.files´ dynamically. "./" in it
always means the project root directory, since gtags
is always invoked there.

This hook is
ignored when the following options are specified: --version,
--help, --config, --dump.

icase_path (boolean)

Ignore case distinctions in the
path. Suffixes check is affected by this capability.

langmap (comma separated
list)

Language mapping. Each
comma-separated map consists of a language name, a colon,
and a list of file extensions. You can specify a glob
pattern surrounded by parentheses instead of an extension
for the files without extensions (e.g.
Make:([Mm]akefile).mak.mk). As a special exception,
gtags collects values from multiple langmap
variables. For these mappings, the first match is adopted.
Default mapping is: 

´c:.c.h,yacc:.y,asm:.s.S,java:.java,cpp:.c++.cc.hh.cpp.cxx.hxx.hpp.C.H,php:.php.php3.phtml´.

skip (comma separated list)

Gtags skips files and
directories which are given in this list. As a special
exception, gtags collects values from multiple skip
variables. If the value ends with ´/´, it is
assumed as a directory and gtags skips all files
under it. The value may include glob patterns (*, ?, [...],
[!...], [^...]).

If the value
starts with ´/´, it is assumed a relative path
name from the root directory of the project. You cannot use
glob patterns for a path name. However, this direction is
out-of-date, and is not recommended. Instead, you can use
-f option which can be combined with find(1).
Since find(1) has rich options to select files, you
can do everything. Additionally, this technique can also be
applied to any other tagging systems like ctags(1),
cscope(1), etc.

Skip list is
also effective when you use the -f or
´gtags.files´.

EXAMPLES

# 
# There are several ways to use Universal Ctags plug-in
parser. 
# 
$ gtags --gtagsconf=/usr/local/share/gtags/gtags.conf
--gtagslabel=universal-ctags 
$ gtags --explain 
or 
$ export GTAGSCONF=/usr/local/share/gtags/gtags.conf 
$ export GTAGSLABEL=universal-ctags 
$ gtags --explain 
or 
# In your project 
$ cp /usr/local/share/gtags/gtags.conf .

$ vi gtags.conf

# default:tc=native => default:tc=universal-ctags

$ gtags --explain

DIAGNOSTICS

Gtags
exits with a non-0 value if an error occurred, 0
otherwise.

Note that files
created by gtags with a non-zero exit code should be
considered corrupted.

BUG

´GTAGS´
and ´GRTAGS´ are very large. In advance of using
this command, check the space of your disk.

Assembly
language support is far from complete. It extracts only
ENTRY() and ALTENTRY() from source file. Probably valid only
for FreeBSD and Linux kernel source.

C++ support is
deprecated.

There is no
concurrency control about tag files.
