DESCRIPTION

mingetty
is a minimal getty for use on virtual consoles. Unlike
agetty(8), mingetty is not suitable for serial
lines. I recommend using mgetty(8) for this
purpose.

OPTIONS

--noclear

Do not clear the screen before
prompting for the login name (the screen is normally
cleared).

--nonewline

Do not print a newline before
writing out /etc/issue.

--noissue

Do not output /etc/issue.

--nohangup

Do not call vhangup() to
disable writing to this tty by other applications.

--nohostname

Do not print the hostname
before the login prompt.

--long-hostname

By default the hostname is only
printed until the first dot. With this option enabled, the
full text from gethostname() is shown.

--loginprog
/bin/login

Change the login app.

--nice 10

Change the priority by calling
nice().

--delay 5

Sleep this many seconds after
startup of mingetty.

--chdir /home

Change into this directory
before calling the login prog.

--chroot /chroot

Call chroot() with this
directory name.

--autologin username

Log the specified user
automatically in without asking for a login name and
password. Check the -f option from /bin/login for
this.

--loginpause

Wait for any key before
dropping to the login prompt. Can be combined with
--autologin to save memory by lazily spawning
shells.

ISSUE ESCAPES

mingetty
recognizes the following escapes sequences which might be
embedded in the /etc/issue file:

\d

insert current day (localtime),

\l

insert line on which mingetty is running,

\m

inserts machine architecture (uname -m),

\n

inserts machine’s network node hostname (uname
-n), 

\o

inserts domain name,

\r

inserts operating system release (uname -r),

\t

insert current time (localtime),

\s

inserts operating system name,

\u

resp. \U the current number of users which are
currently logged in. \U inserts "n users",
where as \u only inserts "n".

\v

inserts operating system version (uname -v).

EXAMPLE

"Linux eos i386 #1 Tue Mar 19 21:54:09 MET 1996"
was produced by putting
"\s \n \m \v" into
/etc/issue.

FILES

/etc/issue,
/var/run/utmp.
