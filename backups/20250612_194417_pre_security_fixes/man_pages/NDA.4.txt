NAME

nda — NVMe Direct
Access device driver

SYNOPSIS

device nvme 
device scbus

DESCRIPTION

The nda driver provides
support for direct access devices, implementing the NVMe
command protocol, that are attached to the system through a
host adapter supported by the CAM subsystem.

SYSCTL VARIABLES

The following variables are
available as both sysctl(8) variables and loader(8)
tunables:

kern.cam.nda.sort_io_queue

This variable
determines whether the software queued entries are sorted in
LBA order or not. Sorting is almost always a waste of time.
The default is to not sort.

The following
report per-device settings, and are read-only unless
otherwise indicated. Replace N with the device unit
number.

kern.cam.nda.N.rotating

This variable
reports whether the storage volume is spinning or flash.
It’s value is hard coded to 0 indicating flash.

kern.cam.nda.N.unmapped_io

This variable reports whether
the nda driver accepts unmapped I/O for this
unit.
