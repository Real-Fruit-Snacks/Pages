NAME

rsports - Rose
port configuration file.

DESCRIPTION

Rsports
is an ASCII file that contains information about each of the
Rose ports that are to be used. When dealing with a Rose
utility such as call, it takes an optional argument
that is the port name. This port name is a reference to the
line within rsports, which has the same name. The
information on each line contains enough information to bind
the command to a particular Rose interface, this binding is
done by matching the address on the line in rsports
with the address of the port set by ifconfig or
rsattach.

The
rsports file may contain comments that begin with a #
in the first column, or a port description in the following
format, each field being delimited by white space:

name address
description

The field
descriptions are:

name

this is the unique Rose port identifier.

address

the address of the Rose interface to bind to.

description

a free format description of this interface, this field
extends to the end of the line. It may contain spaces.
