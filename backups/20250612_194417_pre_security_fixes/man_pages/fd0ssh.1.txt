Name

fd0ssh â€”
pipe for password-over-stdin support to ssh

Syntax

fd0ssh
mount_command

Description

This is a
wrapper for ssh which reads the password from stdin and sets
things up so that ssh will recall the wrapper to get the
password, which will be read from the parent process using a
pipe.

It is used by
pam_mount(8) to mount SSH-based filesystems, such as
ccgfs and sshfs.
