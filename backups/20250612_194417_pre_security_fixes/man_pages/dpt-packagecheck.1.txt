NAME

dpt-packagecheck
-- check package source for group policy consistency

SYNOPSIS

dpt
packagecheck -c check-option...

dpt
packagecheck -p package top-directory
check-option...

DESCRIPTION

dpt
packagecheck performs various checks of package sources
and tries to correct them in accordance with the policies of
the Debian Perl Group.

Package
selection options 
dpt packagecheck can operate either on a single package,
or on all packages maintained by the group.

To run the
checks on all group packages, use the -c option with
working directory containing packages/ directory.

To run the
checks on individual package, use -p package
top-directory, where top-directory is the
directory containing the packages/ directory.

Repository
interaction 
If the -a option is given, changes are committed to
the repository by calling "mr
commit".

If the
-n option is given, no changes are committed.

If neither
option is given, dpt packagecheck asks for
confirmation before calling "mr
commit".

Note that
"mr commit" also pushes the changes to
the remote repository.
