NAME

pwmake - simple
tool for generating random relatively easily pronounceable
passwords

SYNOPSIS

pwmake

DESCRIPTION

pwmake
is a simple configurable tool for generating random and
relatively easily pronounceable passwords. The tool allows
you to specify the number of entropy bits that are used to
generate the password.

The entropy is
pulled from /dev/urandom.

The minimum
number of bits is 56 which is usable for passwords on
systems/services where brute force attacks are of very
limited rate of tries. The 64 bits should be adequate
for applications where the attacker does not have direct
access to the password hash file. For situations where the
attacker might obtain the direct access to the password hash
or the password is used as an encryption key 80 to
128 bits should be used depending on your level of
paranoia.

Any
entropy-bits value outside of the 56 to
256 bits range will be adjusted to fit within the
allowed range.

OPTIONS

The first and
only argument is the number of bits of entropy used to
generate the password.

FILES

/etc/security/pwquality.conf
- The configuration file for the libpwquality library.

RETURN CODES

pwmake
returns 0 on success, non zero on error.
