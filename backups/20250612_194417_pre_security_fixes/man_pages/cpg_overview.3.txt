NAME

cpg_overview -
CPG library overview

OVERVIEW

The CPG library
is delivered with the corosync project. This library is used
to create distributed applications that operate properly
during cluster partitions, merges, and faults.

The library
provides a mechanism to:

* handle
abstraction for multiple instances of a CPG library in one
application

* join one or
more groups

* leave one or
more groups

* Deliver
messages to members of that group

* Deliver
configuration changes

* Iterate
members of groups

SECURITY

If encryption
is enabled in corosync.conf, the CPG library will encrypt
and authenticate message contents. Applications must run as
the ais user to be validated by corosync on IPC connection,
otherwise they will be unable to access the corosync
services.
