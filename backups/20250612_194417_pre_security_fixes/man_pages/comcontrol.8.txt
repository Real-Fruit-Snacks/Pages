COMCONTROL(8)

NAME

comcontrol —
control a special tty device

SYNOPSIS

comcontrol
special_device [dtrwait number]
[drainwait number]

DESCRIPTION

The comcontrol utility is
used to examine and modify some of the special
characteristics of the specified tty device. If no arguments
other than the device (or "-" for stdin) are
specified, it prints the settings of all controllable
characteristics. This usage requires only read access on the
device. Only the superuser can change the settings.

The following
options are available:

dtrwait number

Set the time to wait after
dropping DTR to the given number. The units are hundredths
of a second. The default is 300 hundredths, i.e., 3 seconds.
This option needed mainly to set proper recover time after
modem reset.

drainwait
number

Set the time to wait for output
drain to the given number. The units are seconds. The
default is 5 minutes, 0 means waiting forever. This option
needed mainly to specify upper limit of minutes to prevent
modem hanging.

The standard way
to use comcontrol is to put invocations of it in the
/etc/rc.d/serial startup script.
