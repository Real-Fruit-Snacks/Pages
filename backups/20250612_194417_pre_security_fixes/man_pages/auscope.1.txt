NAME

auscope -
Network Audio System Protocol Filter

SYNOPSIS

auscope
[ option ] ...

DESCRIPTION

auscope
is an audio protocol filter that can be used to view the
network packets being sent between an audio application and
an audio server.

auscope
is written in Perl, so you must have Perl
installed on your machine in order to run auscope. If
your Perl executable is not installed as
/usr/local/bin/perl, you should modify the first line of the
auscope script to reflect the Perl
executableâ€™s location. Or, you can invoke
auscope as

perl
auscope [ option ] ...

assuming the
Perl executable is in your path.

To operate,
auscope must know the port on which it should listen
for audio clients, the name of the desktop machine on which
the audio server is running and the port to use to connect
to the audio server. Both the output port (server) and input
port (client) are automatically biased by 8000. The output
port defaults to 0 and the input port defaults to 1.

ARGUMENTS

-i

Specify the port that
auscope will use to take requests from clients.

-o

Determines the port that
auscope will use to connect to the audio server.

-h

Determines the desktop machine
name that auscope will use to find the audio
server.

-v

Determines the level of
printing which auscope will provide. The print-level
can be 0 or 1. The larger numbers provide greater output
detail.

EXAMPLES

In the
following example, mcxterm is the name of the desktop
machine running the audio server, which is connected to the
TCP/IP network host tcphost. auscope uses the
desktop machine with the -h command line option, will
listen for client requests on port 8001 and connect to the
audio server on port 8000.

Ports (file
descriptors) on the network host are used to read and write
the audio protocol. The audio client auplay will
connect to the audio server via the TCP/IP network host
tcphost and port 8001:

auscope -i1 -o0
-hmcxterm

auplay -audio
tcp/tcphost:8001 dial.snd

In the
following example, the auscope verbosity is increased to 1,
and the audio client autool will connect to the audio
server via the network host tcphost, while displaying
its graphical interface on another server labmcx:

auscope -i1 -o0
-hmcxterm -v1

autool -audio
tcp/tcphost:8001 -display labmcx:0.0
