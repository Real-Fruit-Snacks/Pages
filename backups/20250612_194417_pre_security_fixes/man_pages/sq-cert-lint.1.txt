NAME

sq cert lint -
Check certificates for issues

SYNOPSIS

sq cert
lint [OPTIONS] FILE

DESCRIPTION

Check
certificates for issues.

’sq cert
lint’ checks the supplied certificates for the
following SHA-1-related issues:

- Whether a
certificate revocation uses SHA-1.

- Whether the
current self signature for a non-revoked User ID uses 
SHA-1.

- Whether the
current subkey binding signature for a non-revoked, 
live subkey uses SHA-1.

- Whether a
primary key binding signature ("backsig") for a

non-revoked, live subkey uses SHA-1.

Diagnostics are
printed to stderr. At the end, some statistics are shown.
This is useful when examining a keyring. If
’--fix’ is specified and at least one issue
could be fixed, the fixed certificates are printed to
stdout.

This tool does
not currently support smart cards. But, if only the subkeys
are on a smart card, this tool may still be able to
partially repair the certificate. In particular, it will be
able to fix any issues with User ID self signatures and
subkey binding signatures for encryption-capable subkeys,
but it will not be able to generate new primary key binding
signatures for any signing-capable subkeys.

OPTIONS

Subcommand
options 
-B, --binary

Emit binary data

-F, --fix

Attempts to fix certificates,
when possible

-e,
--export-secret-keys

When fixing a certificate, the
fixed certificate is exported without any secret key
material. Using this switch causes any secret key material
to also be exported

-k,
--list-keys

If set, outputs a list of
fingerprints, one per line, of certificates that have
issues. This output is intended for use by scripts.

This option
implies ’--quiet’. If you also specify
’--fix’, errors will still be printed to stderr,
and fixed certificates will still be emitted to stdout.

-o,
--output=FILE

Write to FILE or stdout if
omitted

-q, --quiet

Quiet; does not output any
diagnostics

FILE

Read from FILE or stdin if omitted

Global
options 
See sq(1) for a description of the global
options.

EXIT STATUS

If
’--fix’ is not specified: 
2 if any issues were found, 
1 if not issues were found, but there were errors reading
the input, 
0 if there were no issues.

If
’--fix’ is specified: 
3 if any issues could not be fixed, 
1 if not issues were found, but there were errors reading
the input, 
0 if all issues were fixed or there were no issues.

EXAMPLES

To gather
statistics, simply run:

sq cert lint
keyring.pgp

To fix a
key:

gpg
--export-secret-keys FPR \

| sq cert lint --fix -p
passw0rd -p password123 \ 
| gpg --import

To get a list
of keys with issues:

sq cert lint
--list-keys keyring.pgp \

| while read FPR; do something;
done
