NAME

nbdkit-split-plugin
- nbdkit plugin to concatenate split files into one disk

SYNOPSIS

nbdkit split
[file=]file1 [[file=]file2 [file=]file3 ...]

DESCRIPTION

"nbdkit-split-plugin"
is a file plugin for nbdkit(1). One or more filenames
may be given using the "FILENAME" parameter. These
files are logically concatenated into a single disk
image.

If you want to
add a virtual partition table, see
nbdkit-partitioning-plugin(1).

Differences
from nbdkit-file-plugin 
Normally to serve a single file you should use
nbdkit-file-plugin(1). This plugin differs from
nbdkit-file-plugin as follows:

•

nbdkit-file-plugin is faster and more efficient. It has
a fully parallel implementation, and does not have to deal
with the complexity of locating the correct file to serve or
splitting requests across files.

•

nbdkit-file-plugin allows you to resize the underlying
file dynamically. The underlying files must not be
resized when using the split plugin.

•

nbdkit-file-plugin can handle block devices, but the
split plugin can only handle plain files.

•

nbdkit-file-plugin handles writes of blocks of zeroes
efficiently, but the split plugin cannot.

•

nbdkit-file-plugin can "punch holes" in the
backing file in response to a trim request from the client,
but the split plugin does not support this.

PARAMETERS

[file=]FILENAME

One or more files to open. They
are logically concatenated in the order they appear on the
command line.

This parameter
must appear at least once.

"file="
is a magic config key and may be omitted in most cases. See
"Magic parameters" in nbdkit(1).

FILES

$plugindir/nbdkit-split-plugin.so

The plugin.

Use
"nbdkit --dump-config" to find the location of
$plugindir.

VERSION
