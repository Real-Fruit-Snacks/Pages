NAME

cpg_leave -
Leave a group in the CPG library

SYNOPSIS

#include

int
cpg_leave(cpg_handle_t handle, struct cpg_name
*group);

DESCRIPTION

The
cpg_leave function is used to leave a group. Once a
group has been left the process will no longer receive
messages or notifications about events in that group. Note
that a process is only deemed to have left the group once it
has been notified (by its confchg callback) that is has
left. So expect to receive at least one confchg callback
after calling this function.

The argument
group is used to specify the group to leave. It is
currently ignored as only one group can be joined per
handle. It is included here for to allow for future
development.

RETURN VALUE

This call
returns the CS_OK value if successful, otherwise an error is
returned.

ERRORS

The errors are
undocumented.
