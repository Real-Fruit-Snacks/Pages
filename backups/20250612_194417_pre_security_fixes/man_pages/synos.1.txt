NAME

synos −
guess operating system from TCP SYN fingerprint

SYNOPSIS

synos
[−−mtu mtu] [−−db
path] syn-fingerprint

DESCRIPTION

synos takes a
SYN fingerprint, in the format described for
the CLIENT_SYNFP environment variable
in the avenger(1) man page, and outputs a guess as to
the type of the client operating system. synos makes use of
the OpenBSD SYN fingerprint database (which
is also repackaged with Mail Avenger).

OPTIONS

−−mtu val

Certain operating systems set
the initial TCP window size based on the
maximum transmission unit, or MTU, of the
network. For such operating systems, synos usually checks
the window size using both the client’s
MSS option plus 40 bytes (for
TCP and IP headers), or a
hard-coded MTU, which defaults to 1,500
bytes. If either value works, the fingerprint is considered
to match the operating system. You can change the value
1,500 by specifying this option. A value of 0 tells synos to
use only the value derived from the MSS
option.

−−db
file

Specifies an alternate location
for the SYN fingerprint database.

FILES

BUGS

The operating
system type is determined by heuristics that are not always
reliable. Moreover, not all operating systems can be
distinguished. The database may not even contain a
client’s particular operating system and version.

It is not hard
to fool synos deliberately by changing TCP
socket options or injecting raw packets onto the
network.
