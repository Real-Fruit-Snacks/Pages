SYNOPSIS

#include

int
sasl_getopt_t(void *context, 
const char *plugin_name, 
const char *option, 
const char ** result, 
unsigned * len);

DESCRIPTION

int
sasl_getopt_t(void *context, 
const char *plugin_name, 
const char *option, 
const char ** result, 
unsigned * len);

sasl_getopt_t is used to
retrieve an option, often mechanism specific, from the
application. An example of this is requesting what
KERBEROS_V4 srvtab file to use. 
Parameters

•

context – is the SASL connection
context 

•

plugin_name – is the plugin this value is
for. 

•

option – is a string representing the
option. A common option that all server applications should
handle is the method for checking plaintext passwords. See
the administrators guide for a full description of
this option.

Memory
management of options supplied by the getopt callback should
be done by the application, however, any requested option
must remain available until the callback is no longer valid.
That is, when sasl_dispose(3) is called for a the
connection it is associated with, or sasl_done(3) is
called for global callbacks.

RETURN VALUE

SASL callback
functions should return SASL return codes. See sasl.h for a
complete list. SASL_OK indicates success.

Other return
codes indicate errors and should be handled.
