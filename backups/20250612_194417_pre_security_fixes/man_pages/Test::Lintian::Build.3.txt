NAME
       Test::Lintian::Build -- routines to prepare the work directories

SYNOPSIS
         use Test::Lintian::Build qw(build_subject);

DESCRIPTION
       The routines in this module prepare the work directories in which the
       tests are run. To do so, they use the specifications in the test set.

FUNCTIONS
       build_subject(PATH)
           Populates a work directory RUN_PATH with data from the test located
           in SPEC_PATH. The optional parameter REBUILD forces a rebuild if
           true.
