NAME

isdntelctl —
control isdn4bsd telephone sound format conversion

SYNOPSIS

isdntelctl
[−c] [−g]
[−u unit] [−A]
[−U] [−N]

DESCRIPTION

The isdntelctl utility is
part of the isdn4bsd package and is used to configure the
sound format conversion facilities of the /dev/i4btel
interfaces.

The following
options are available:

−c

Clear the
telephone input queue.

−g

Get the sound
format currently in use.

−u

Set the
/dev/i4btel unit number. The default value is zero to access
device /dev/i4btel0.

−A

Do A-law (ISDN
line) -> u-law (userland) conversion.

−U

Do u-law (ISDN
line) -> A-law (userland) conversion.

−N

Set sound
conversion to do no format conversion.

The telephony
data stream comes out of the line in a bit-reversed format,
so the i4btel(4) driver does the bit-reversion process in
any case.

Additionally,
the user can specify to do A-law to u-law, u-law to A-law or
no conversion at all in the i4btel driver by using the
isdntelctl utility.

FILES

/dev/i4btel

STANDARDS

A-Law and u-Law are specified in
ITU Recommendation G.711.

EXAMPLES

The command:

isdntelctl
-g

displays the
currently used sound format for device /dev/i4btel0.
