NAME
       Net::DBus::Dumper - Stringify Net::DBus objects suitable for printing

SYNOPSIS
         use Net::DBus::Dumper;

         use Net::DBus;

         # Dump out info about the bus
         my $bus = Net::DBus->find;
         print dbus_dump($bus);

         # Dump out info about a service
         my $service = $bus->get_service("org.freedesktop.DBus");
         print dbus_dump($service);

         # Dump out info about an object
         my $object = $service->get_object("/org/freedesktop/DBus");
         print dbus_dump($object);

DESCRIPTION
       This module serves as a debugging aid, providing a means to stringify a
       DBus related object in a form suitable for printing out. It can
       stringify any of the Net::DBus:* objects, generating the following
       information for each

       Net::DBus
           A list of services registered with the bus

       Net::DBus::Service =item Net::DBus::RemoteService
           The service name

       Net::DBus::Object =item Net::DBus::RemoteObject
           The list of all exported methods, and signals, along with their
           parameter and return types.

METHODS
       my @data = dbus_dump($object);
           Generates a stringified representation of an object. The object
           passed in as the parameter must be an instance of one of Net::DBus,
           Net::DBus::RemoteService, Net::DBus::Service,
           Net::DBus::RemoteObject, Net::DBus::Object. The stringified
           representation will be returned as a list of strings, with newlines
           in appropriate places, such that it can be passed string to the
           "print" method.

BUGS
       It should print out a list of object paths registered against a
       service, but this only currently works for service implemented in Perl
