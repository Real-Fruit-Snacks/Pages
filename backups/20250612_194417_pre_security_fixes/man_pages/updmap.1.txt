NAME

updmap - manage
TeX font maps, per-user 
updmap-sys - manage TeX font maps, system-wide

SYNOPSIS

updmap
[-user|-sys] [OPTION] ... [COMMAND]

updmap-user [OPTION] ... [COMMAND] 
updmap-sys [OPTION] ... [COMMAND]

DESCRIPTION

updmap version
r51338 (2019-06-07 18:36:59 +0200)

Update the
default font map files used by pdftex (pdftex.map), dvips
(psfonts.map), and dvipdfm(x), and optionally pxdvi, as
determined by all configuration files updmap.cfg (the ones
returned by running "kpsewhich --all
updmap.cfg", but see below).

Among other
things, these map files are used to determine which fonts
should be used as bitmaps and which as outlines, and to
determine which font files are included, typically
subsetted, in the PDF or PostScript output.

updmap-sys (or
updmap -sys) is intended to affect the system-wide
configuration, while updmap-user (or updmap -user)
affects personal configuration files only, overriding the
system files. As a consequence, once updmap-user has been
run, even a single time, running updmap-sys no longer has
any effect. (updmap-sys issues a warning in this
situation.)

See
http://tug.org/texlive/scripts-sys-user.html for
details.

By default, the
TeX filename database (ls-R) is also updated.

The updmap
system is regrettably complicated, for both inherent and
historical reasons. A general overview:

- updmap.cfg
files are mainly about listing other files, namely the

font-specific
.maps, in which each line gives information about a
different TeX (.tfm) font.

- updmap reads
the updmap.cfg files and then concatenates the

contents of
those .map files into the main output files: psfonts.map for
dvips and pdftex.map for pdftex and dvipdfmx.

- The
updmap.cfg files themselves are created and updated at
package

installation
time, by the system installer or the package manager or by
hand, and not (by default) by updmap.

Good luck.

The main
output:

The main output
of updmap is the files containing the individual font map
lines which the drivers (dvips, pdftex, etc.) read to handle
fonts.

The map files
for dvips (psfonts.map) and pdftex and dvipdfmx (pdftex.map)
are written to
TEXMFVAR/fonts/map/updmap/{dvips,pdftex}/.

In addition,
information about Kanji fonts is written to
TEXMFVAR/fonts/map/updmap/dvipdfmx/kanjix.map, and
optionally to TEXMFVAR/fonts/map/updmap/pxdvi/xdvi-ptex.map.
These are for Kanji only and are not like other map files.
dvipdfmx reads pdftex.map for the map entries for non-Kanji
fonts.

If no option is
given, so the invocation is just "updmap-user" or
"updmap-sys", these output files are always
recreated.

Otherwise, if
an option such as --enable or --disable is
given, the output files are recreated if the list of enabled
map files (from updmap.cfg) has changed. The --force
option overrides this, always recreating the output
files.

Explanation of
the map types:

The normal type
is Map.

The only
difference between Map and MixedMap is that MixedMap entries
are not added to psfonts_pk.map. The purpose is to help
users with devices that render Type 1 outline fonts worse
than mode-tuned Type 1 bitmap fonts. So, MixedMap is used
for fonts that are available as both Type 1 and
Metafont.

KanjiMap
entries are added to psfonts_t1.map and kanjix.map.

Explanation of
the OPTION names for --showoptions,
--showoption, --setoption: 
dvipsPreferOutline

true,false (default true)

Whether dvips
uses bitmaps or outlines, when both are available.

dvipsDownloadBase35

true,false (default true)

Whether dvips
includes the standard 35 PostScript fonts in its output.

pdftexDownloadBase14

true,false (default true)

Whether pdftex
includes the standard 14 PDF fonts in its output.

pxdviUse

true,false (default false)

Whether maps
for pxdvi (Japanese-patched xdvi) are under updmap’s
control.

jaEmbed

(any string)

jaVariant

(any string)

scEmbed

(any string)

tcEmbed

(any string)

koEmbed

(any string)

See below.

LW35

URWkb,URW,ADOBEkb,ADOBE (default URWkb)

Adapt the font
and file names of the standard 35 PostScript fonts.

URWkb

URW fonts with "berry"
filenames (e.g. uhvbo8ac.pfb)

URW

URW fonts with "vendor" filenames (e.g.
n019064l.pfb) 

ADOBEkb

Adobe fonts with
"berry" filenames (e.g. phvbo8an.pfb)

ADOBE

Adobe fonts with "vendor" filenames (e.g.
hvnbo___.pfb) 

These options
are only read and acted on by updmap; dvips, pdftex, etc.,
do not know anything about them. They work by changing the
default map file which the programs read, so they can be
overridden by specifying command-line options or
configuration files to the programs, as explained at the
beginning of updmap.cfg.

The options
jaEmbed and jaVariant (formerly kanjiEmbed and kanjiVariant)
specify special replacements in the map lines. If a map
contains the string @jaEmbed@, then this will be replaced by
the value of that option; similarly for jaVariant. In this
way, users of Japanese TeX can select different fonts to be
included in the final output. The counterpart for Simplified
Chinese, Traditional Chinese and Korean fonts are scEmbed,
tcEmbed and koEmbed respectively.

ENVIRONMENT

Explanation of
trees and files normally used:

If
--cnffile is specified on the command line (can be
given multiple times), its value(s) is(are) used. Otherwise,
updmap reads all the updmap.cfg files found by running
’kpsewhich -all updmap.cfg’, in the order
returned by kpsewhich (which is the order of trees defined
in texmf.cnf).

In either case,
if multiple updmap.cfg files are found, all the maps
mentioned in all the updmap.cfg files are merged.

Thus, if
updmap.cfg files are present in all trees, and the default
layout is used as shipped with TeX Live on Debian, the
following files are read, in the given order.

For updmap-sys:

TEXMFSYSCONFIG /etc/texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg 
TEXMFSYSVAR /var/lib/texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg 
TEXMFLOCAL /usr/local/share/texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg

TEXMFDEBIAN /usr/share/texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg 
TEXMFDIST
/usr/share/texlive/texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg

For
updmap-user: 
TEXMFCONFIG $HOME/.texmf-config/web2c/updmap.cfg 
TEXMFVAR $HOME/.texmf-var/web2c/updmap.cfg 
TEXMFHOME $HOME/texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg 
TEXMFSYSCONFIG /etc/web2c/updmap.cfg 
TEXMFSYSVAR /var/lib/texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg 
TEXMFLOCAL /usr/local/share/texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg

TEXMFDEBIAN /usr/share/texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg 
TEXMFDIST
/usr/share/texlive/texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg

According to
the actions, updmap might write to one of the given files or
create a new updmap.cfg, described further below.

Where and which
updmap.cfg changes are saved:

When no options
are given, the updmap.cfg file(s) are only read, not
written. It’s when an option --setoption,
--enable or --disable is specified that an
updmap.cfg needs to be updated. In this case:

1) If config
files are given on the command line, then the first one
given is used to save any such changes.

2) If the
config files are taken from kpsewhich output, then the
algorithm is more complex:

2a) If
$TEXMFCONFIG/web2c/updmap.cfg or
$TEXMFHOME/web2c/updmap.cfg appears in the list of
used files, then the one listed first by kpsewhich
--all (equivalently, the one returned by kpsewhich
updmap.cfg), is used.

2b) If neither
of the above two are present and changes are made, a new
config file is created in
$TEXMFCONFIG/web2c/updmap.cfg.

In general, the
idea is that if the user cannot write to a given config
file, a higher-level one can be used. That way, the
distribution’s settings can be overridden system-wide
using TEXMFLOCAL, and system settings can be overridden
again in a particular user’s TEXMFHOME.

Resolving
multiple definitions of a font:

If a font is
defined in more than one map file, then the definition
coming from the first-listed updmap.cfg is used. If a font
is defined multiple times within the same map file, one is
chosen arbitrarily. In both cases a warning is issued.

Disabling
maps:

updmap.cfg
files with higher priority (listed earlier) can disable maps
mentioned in lower priority (listed later) updmap.cfg files
by writing, e.g.,

#! Map
mapname.map

or

#! MixedMap
mapname.map

in the higher-priority
updmap.cfg file.

(The #! must be at the

beginning of
the line, with at least one space or tab afterward, and
whitespace between each word on the list.)

As an example,
suppose you have a copy of MathTime Pro fonts and want to
disable the Belleek version of the fonts; that is, disable
the map belleek.map. You can create the file
$TEXMFCONFIG/web2c/updmap.cfg with the content

#! Map
belleek.map Map mt-plus.map Map mt-yy.map

and call
updmap.

Listing of
maps:

The two options
--listmaps and --listavailablemaps list all
maps defined in any of the updmap.cfg files (for
--listmaps), and only those actually found on the
system (for --listavailablemaps). The output format
is one line per font map, with the following fields
separated by tabs: map, type (Map, MixedMap, KanjiMap),
status (enabled, disabled), origin (the updmap.cfg file
where it is mentioned, or ’builtin’ for the
three basic maps).

In the case of
--listmaps there can be one additional fields (again
separated by tab) containing ’(not available)’
for those map files that cannot be found.

updmap-user vs.
updmap-sys:

When updmap-sys
is run, TEXMFSYSCONFIG and TEXMFSYSVAR are used instead of
TEXMFCONFIG and TEXMFVAR, respectively. This is the primary
difference between updmap-sys and updmap-user.

Other locations
may be used if you give them on the command line, or these
trees don’t exist, or you are not using the original
TeX Live.

To see the
precise locations of the various files that will be read and
written, give the -n option (or read the source).

EXAMPLES

The log file is
written to TEXMFVAR/web2c/updmap.log.

FILES

Configuration
and input files: 
updmap.cfg

Main configuration file. In
texmf-dist/web2c by default, but may be located
elsewhere depending on your distribution. Each texmf tree
read should have its own updmap.cfg.

PostScript fonts for use with dvips(1).

pdftex35.map

Map file for standard 35
PostScript fonts for use with pdftex(1).

For dvips(1). Same as
psfonts_t1.map if option dvipsPreferOutline
active, else as psfonts_pk.map.

psfonts_pk.map

For dvips(1). Without
information from MixedMap files. (Setting of
dvipsPreferOutline ignored.)
