NAME

sasl_client_init
- Cyrus SASL documentation

SYNOPSIS

#include

int
sasl_client_init(const sasl_callback_t *callbacks )

DESCRIPTION

sasl_client_init
initializes SASL.

It must be
called before any calls to sasl_client_start(3). This
call initializes all SASL client drivers (e.g.
authentication mechanisms). These are usually found in the
/usr/lib/sasl2 directory but the directory may be
overridden with the SASL_PATH environment
variable.

RETURN VALUE

SASL callback
functions should return SASL return codes. See sasl.h for a
complete list. SASL_OK indicates success.

The following
return codes indicate errors and should either be handled or
the authentication session should be quit:

•

SASL_BADVERS: Mechanism version mismatch

•

SASL_BADPARAM: Error in config file

•

SASL_NOMEM: Not enough memory to complete
operation
