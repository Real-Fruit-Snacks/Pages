GEM(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual GEM(4)

NAME

gem — ERI/GEM/GMAC
Ethernet device driver

SYNOPSIS

To compile this driver into the
kernel, place the following lines in your kernel
configuration file:

device
miibus 
device gem

Alternatively,
to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following line in loader.conf(5):

if_gem_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION

The gem driver provides
support for the GMAC Ethernet hardware found mostly in the
last Apple PowerBooks G3s and most G4-based Apple hardware,
as well as Sun UltraSPARC machines.

All controllers
supported by the gem driver have TCP checksum offload
capability for both receive and transmit, support for the
reception and transmission of extended frames for vlan(4)
and a 512-bit multicast hash filter.

HARDWARE

Chips supported by the
gem driver include:

•

Apple GMAC

•

Sun ERI 10/100 Mbps
Ethernet

•

Sun GEM Gigabit Ethernet

The following
add-on cards are known to work with the gem driver at
this time:

•

Sun Gigabit Ethernet PCI
2.0/3.0 (GBE/P) (part no. 501-4373)

•

Sun Gigabit Ethernet SBus
2.0/3.0 (GBE/S) (part no. 501-4375)

NOTES

On sparc64 the gem driver
respects the local-mac-address? system configuration
variable which can be set in the Open Firmware boot monitor
using the setenv command or by eeprom(8). If set to
’’false’’ (the default), the
gem driver will use the system’s default MAC
address for all of its devices. If set to
’’true’’, the unique MAC address of
each interface is used if present rather than the
system’s default MAC address.

Supported
interfaces having their own MAC address include the on-board
Sun ERI 10/100 Mbps on boards equipped with more than one
Ethernet interface and the Sun Gigabit Ethernet 2.0/3.0 GBE
add-on cards.

HISTORY

The gem device driver
appeared in NetBSD 1.6. The first FreeBSD version to
include it was FreeBSD 5.0.
