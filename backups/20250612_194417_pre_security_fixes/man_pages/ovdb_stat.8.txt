Display information from the ovdb database

SYNOPSIS

ovdb_stat
[-Hgci] [-r artnumrange]
newsgroup [newsgroup ...]

ovdb_stat
-HklmMtv [-d database]

DESCRIPTION

ovdb_stat
displays information from the ovdb database:
Berkeley DB statistics, newsgroup data, and overview
records. The output can optionally be in HTML format.

The number of
overview records stored in the database can be obtained with
the "inndf -n" command.

OPTIONS

-g

Newsgroup high water mark, low
marker mark, article count, and flag for the given
newsgroups (as stored in the ovdb groupinfo database)
are displayed.

-c

Similar to -g, except the high water mark, low
water mark, and article count are calculated by actually
scanning the overview records and counting them. This can be
a lengthy operation on groups with lots of articles.

-i

Internal data regarding the given newsgroups are
displayed. 

-r
artnumrange

Overview records are retrieved.
The artnumrange parameter may be a single article
number, or a range of articles in the format
"low-high".

-H

Output is presented in HTML format.

-k

Displays lock region statistics, as returned by the
Berkeley DB "lock_stat()" call.

-l

Displays log region statistics, as returned by the
Berkeley DB "log_stat()" call.

-m

Displays global memory pool statistics, as returned by
the Berkeley DB "memp_stat()" call.

-M

Same as -m, and also displays memory pool
statistics for each database file.

-t

Displays log region statistics, as returned by the
Berkeley DB "txn_stat()" call.

-v

Displays ovdb version, and Berkeley DB version.

-d database

Displays information about the
given database, as returned by the Berkeley DB
"db->stat()" call. This operation may take a
long time on busy systems (several minutes or more).

WARNINGS

ovdb_stat
may be safely killed with the INT, TERM, or HUP signals. It
catches those signals and exits cleanly. Do not kill
ovdb_stat with other signals, unless absolutely
necessary, because it may leave stale locks in the database
environment.
