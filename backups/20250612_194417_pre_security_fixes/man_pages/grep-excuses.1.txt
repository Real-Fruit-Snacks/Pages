NAME

grep-excuses -
search the testing excuses files for a specific
maintainer

SYNOPSIS

grep-excuses
[options] [maintainer|package]

DESCRIPTION

grep-excuses
downloads the autoremovals and update_excuses.html files and
greps them for the specified maintainer or package name. The
wget package is required for this script. If no name
is given on the command line, first the environment variable
DEBFULLNAME is used if it is defined, and failing
that, the configuration variable described below is
used.

OPTIONS

--no-conf,
--noconf

Do not read any configuration
files. This can only be used as the first option given on
the command-line.

--wipnity, -w

Get information from
https://qa.debian.org/excuses.php>. One or more
package names must be given when using this option.

--help

Show a brief usage message.

--version

Show version and copyright
information.

--autopkgtests

Investigate and show
autopkgtest (ci.debian.net) failures in your packages but
apparently caused by new versions of other packages trying
to migrate. (--no-autopkgtests can be used to
override GREP_EXCUSES_AUTOPKGTESTS.)

--no-autoremovals

Investigate and show only
testing propagation excuses, not autoremovals.

--experimental,
-e

Print pseudo-excuses for manual
migration from experimental to unstable.

--debug

Print debugging output to
stderr (including url(s) fetched).

CONFIGURATION VARIABLES

The two
configuration files /etc/devscripts.conf and
~/.devscripts are sourced in that order to set
configuration variables. Command line options can be used to
override configuration file settings. Environment variable
settings are ignored for this purpose. The currently
recognised variable is: 
GREP_EXCUSES_MAINTAINER

The default maintainer, email
or package to grep for if none is specified on the command
line.

GREP_EXCUSES_AUTOPKGTESTS

Boolean: whether to show
autopkgtest failures in other packages. See
--autopkgtests.
