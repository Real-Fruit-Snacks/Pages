NAME

nbdkit-ddrescue-filter
- nbdkit filter for serving from ddrescue dump

SYNOPSIS

nbdkit
--filter=ddrescue plugin [plugin-args...] 
ddrescue-mapfile=file.map

nbdkit
--filter=ddrescue file file=file.img
ddrescue-mapfile=file.map 
[plugin-args...]

DESCRIPTION

"nbdkit-ddrescue-filter"
is a filter for nbdkit(1) which overlays bad blocks
according to a GNU ddrescue(1) mapfile. This is
mainly useful for testing disk images recovered with
ddrescue, to detect which files or filesystem structures are
impacted, or attempting fsck on them.

Note that the
current implementation is read-only.

EXAMPLES

Expose a
rescued disk image with detected bad sectors:

nbdkit --filter=ddrescue file
file=disk.img ddrescue-mapfile=disk.map

The above
command serves the disk image disk.img and maps the bad
sectors listed in disk.img so that read attempts on them do
not return a valid block full of zeroes.

PARAMETERS

The
"ddrescue-mapfile" parameter must point to a valid
GNU ddrescue mapfile.

DATA FORMAT

The file
pointed to by the "ddrescue-mapfile" parameter
should conform to the format of a GNU ddrescue(1)
mapfile.

FILES

$filterdir/nbdkit-ddrescue-filter.so

The filter.

Use
"nbdkit --dump-config" to find the location of
$filterdir.

VERSION

"nbdkit-ddrescue-filter"
first appeared in nbdkit 1.22.
