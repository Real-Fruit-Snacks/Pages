NAME

pamshadedrelief
- generate shaded relief image from an elevation map

SYNOPSIS

pamshadedrelief

[-gamma
g]

DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

pamshadedrelief
creates a shaded relief image from an elevation map. A
shaded relief image is a visual image of terrain, showing
the terrain as if illuminated by oblique light and viewed
from above, so that the brightess of each spot depends upon
its slope. A common example of a shaded relief image is a
relief map of the Earth, which shows mountains and
valleys.

The image
pamshadedrelief creates is as if illumated by a light
source from the left.

The output
image is a PAM with tuple type GRAYSCALE.

The program
pamcrater is a good thing to use to demonstrate the
function of pamshadedrelief. It generates a terrain
map of a cratered landscape.

OPTIONS

In addition to
the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most
notably -quiet, see
 Common Options ),
pamshadedrelief recognizes the following command line
option: 
-gamma factor 
-g factor

The specified factor is
used to gamma adjust the image in the same manner as
performed by pnmgamma. The default value is 1.0,
which results in a medium contrast image. Values larger than
1 lighten the image and reduce contrast, while values less
than 1 darken the image, increasing contrast.

Note that this
is separate from the gamma correction that is part of the
definition of the PAM GRAYSCALE format. The image
pamshadedrelief generates is a genuine,
gamma-corrected PAM GRAYSCALE image in any case. This option
simply changes the contrast and may compensate for a display
device that does not correctly render PAM GRAYSCALE
images.

DESIGN NOTES

The-gamma
option isn’t really necessary since you can achieve
the same effect by piping the output from
pamshadedrelief through pnmgamma. However,
pamshadedrelief performs an internal gamma map anyway
in the process of rendering the elevation array into the PAM
GRAYSCALE format, so there’s no additional overhead in
allowing an additional gamma adjustment.
