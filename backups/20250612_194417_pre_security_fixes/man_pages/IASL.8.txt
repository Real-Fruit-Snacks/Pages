DESCRIPTION

The iasl utility is a
compiler/decompiler for ACPI Source Language (ASL) and ACPI
Machine Language (AML). Major features of iasl
include:

•

Full support for the ACPI 2.0b
Specification including ASL grammar elements and
operators.

•

Extensive compiler syntax and
semantic error checking, especially in the area of control
methods. This reduces the number of errors that are not
discovered until the AML code is actually interpreted (i.e.,
the compile-time error checking reduces the number of
run-time errors).

•

Multiple types of output files,
including formatted listing files with intermixed source,
several types of AML files, and error messages.

OPTIONS 
−b p|t|b

Create compiler debug/trace
file (*.txt). Types: Parse/Tree/Both.

−c

Parse only, no
output generation.

−d file

Disassemble AML to ASL source
code file (*.dsl).

−dc file

Disassemble AML and immediately
compile it. (Obtain DSDT from current system if no input
file.)

−e

Generate
External() statements for unresolved symbols.

−f

Ignore errors,
force creation of AML output file(s).

−g

Get ACPI tables
and write to files (*.dat).

−h

Additional help
and compiler debug options.

−hc

Display
operators allowed in constant expressions.

−hr

Display ACPI
reserved method names.

−i a|c

Create
assembler or C include file (*.inc or
*.h).

−l

Create mixed
listing file (ASL source and AML) (*.lst).

−ln

Create
namespace file (*.nsp).

−ls

Create combined
source file (expanded includes) (*.src).

−oa

Disable all
optimizations (compatibility mode).

−of

Disable
constant folding.

−oi

Disable integer
optimization to Zero/One/Ones.

−on

Disable named
reference string optimization.

−ot

Display compile
times.

−p
prefix

Specify filename prefix for all
output files (including .aml).

−s a|c

Create AML in
assembler or C source file (*.asm or *.c).

−t a|c

Create AML in
assembler or C hex table (*.hex).

−vi

Less verbose
errors and warnings for use with IDEs.

−vo

Enable
optimization comments.

−vr

Disable
remarks.

−vs

Disable
signon.

−x level

Set debug level for trace
output.
