arp — Address
Resolution Protocol

SYNOPSIS

device ether

DESCRIPTION

The Address Resolution Protocol
(ARP) is used to dynamically map between Protocol Addresses
(such as IP addresses) and Local Network Addresses (such as
Ethernet addresses). This implementation maps IP addresses
to Ethernet, ARCnet, or Token Ring addresses. It is used by
all the Ethernet interface drivers.

ARP caches
Internet-Ethernet address mappings. When an interface
requests a mapping for an address not in the cache, ARP
queues the message which requires the mapping and broadcasts
a message on the associated network requesting the address
mapping. If a response is provided, the new mapping is
cached and any pending message is transmitted. ARP will
queue at most one packet while waiting for a response to a
mapping request; only the most recently
’’transmitted’’ packet is kept. If
the target host does not respond after several requests, the
host is considered to be down allowing an error to be
returned to transmission attempts. Further demand for this
mapping causes ARP request retransmissions, that are
ratelimited to one packet per second. The error is EHOSTDOWN
for a non-responding destination host, and EHOSTUNREACH for
a non-responding router.

The ARP cache is
stored in the system routing table as dynamically-created
host routes. The route to a directly-attached Ethernet
network is installed as a
’’cloning’’ route (one with the
RTF_CLONING flag set), causing routes to individual hosts on
that network to be created on demand. These routes time out
periodically (normally 20 minutes after validated; entries
are not validated when not in use).

ARP entries may
be added, deleted or changed with the arp(8) utility.
Manually-added entries may be temporary or permanent, and
may be ’’published’’, in which case
the system will respond to ARP requests for that host as if
it were the target of the request.

In the past, ARP
was used to negotiate the use of a trailer encapsulation.
This is no longer supported.

ARP watches
passively for hosts impersonating the local host (i.e., a
host which responds to an ARP mapping request for the local
host’s address).

Proxy ARP is a
feature whereby the local host will respond to requests for
addresses other than itself, with its own address. Normally,
proxy ARP in FreeBSD is set up on a host-by-host basis using
the arp(8) utility, by adding an entry for each host inside
a given subnet for which proxying of ARP requests is
desired. However, the ’’proxy all’’
feature causes the local host to act as a proxy for
all hosts reachable through some other network
interface, different from the one the request came in from.
It may be enabled by setting the sysctl(8) MIB variable
net.link.ether.inet.proxyall to 1.

MIB Variables

The ARP protocol implements a
number of configurable variables in
net.link.ether.inet branch of the sysctl(3) MIB.

allow_multicast

Install ARP
entries with the multicast bit set in the hardware address.
Installing such entries is an RFC 1812 violation, but some
proprietary load balancing techniques require routers to do
so. Turned off by default.

garp_rexmit_count

Retransmit
gratuitous ARP (GARP) packets when an IPv4 address is added
to an interface. A GARP is always transmitted when an IPv4
address is added to an interface. A non-zero value causes
the GARP packet to be retransmitted the stated number of
times. The interval between retransmissions is doubled each
time, so the retransmission intervals are: {1, 2, 4, 8, 16,
...} (seconds). The default value of zero means only the
initial GARP is sent; no additional GARP packets are
retransmitted. The maximum value is sixteen.

The default
behavior of a single GARP packet is usually sufficient.
However, a single GARP might be dropped or lost in some
circumstances. This is particularly harmful when a shared
address is passed between cluster nodes. Neighbors on the
network link might then work with a stale ARP cache and send
packets destined for that address to the node that
previously owned the address, which might not respond.

log_arp_movements

Log movements
of IP addresses from one hardware address to another. See
DIAGNOSTICS below. Turned on by default.

log_arp_permanent_modify

Log attempts by
a remote host to modify a permanent ARP entry. See
DIAGNOSTICS below. Turned on by default.

log_arp_wrong_iface

Log attempts to
insert an ARP entry on an interface when the IP network to
which the address belongs is connected to another interface.
See DIAGNOSTICS below. Turned on by default.

max_log_per_second

Limit the
number of remotely triggered logging events to a configured
value per second. Default is 1 log message per second.

max_age

How long an ARP
entry is held in the cache until it needs to be refreshed.
Default is 1200 seconds.

maxhold

How many
packets to hold in the per-entry output queue while the
entry is being resolved. Default is one packet.

maxtries

Number of
retransmits before a host is considered down and an error is
returned. Default is 5 tries.

proxyall

Enables ARP
proxying. Turned off by default.

wait

Lifetime of an
incomplete ARP entry. Default is 20 seconds.

DIAGNOSTICS

arp: %x:%x:%x:%x:%x:%x is
using my IP address %d.%d.%d.%d on %s!  ARP has
discovered another host on the local network which responds
to mapping requests for its own Internet address with a
different Ethernet address, generally indicating that two
hosts are attempting to use the same Internet address.

arp: link
address is broadcast for IP address %d.%d.%d.%d! 
ARP requested information for a host, and received an answer
indicating that the host’s ethernet address is the
ethernet broadcast address. This indicates a misconfigured
or broken device.

arp:
%d.%d.%d.%d moved from %x:%x:%x:%x:%x:%x to
%x:%x:%x:%x:%x:%x on %s  ARP had a cached value for
the ethernet address of the referenced host, but received a
reply indicating that the host is at a new address. This can
happen normally when host hardware addresses change, or when
a mobile node arrives or leaves the local subnet. It can
also indicate a problem with proxy ARP. This message can
only be issued if the sysctl
net.link.ether.inet.log_arp_movements is set to 1,
which is the system’s default behaviour.

arpresolve:
can’t allocate llinfo for %d.%d.%d.%d  The
route for the referenced host points to a device upon which
ARP is required, but ARP was unable to allocate a routing
table entry in which to store the host’s MAC address.
This usually points to a misconfigured routing table. It can
also occur if the kernel cannot allocate memory.

arp:
%d.%d.%d.%d is on if0 but got reply from %x:%x:%x:%x:%x:%x
on if1  Physical connections exist to the same
logical IP network on both if0 and if1. It can also occur if
an entry already exists in the ARP cache for the IP address
above, and the cable has been disconnected from if0, then
reconnected to if1. This message can only be issued if the
sysctl net.link.ether.inet.log_arp_wrong_iface is set
to 1, which is the system’s default behaviour.

arp:
%x:%x:%x:%x:%x:%x attempts to modify permanent entry for
%d.%d.%d.%d on %s  ARP has received an ARP reply
that attempts to overwrite a permanent entry in the local
ARP table. This error will only be logged if the sysctl
net.link.ether.inet.log_arp_permanent_modify is set
to 1, which is the system’s default behaviour.

arp:
%x:%x:%x:%x:%x:%x is multicast  Kernel refused to
install an entry with multicast hardware address. If you
really want such addresses being installed, set the sysctl
net.link.ether.inet.allow_multicast to a positive
value.
