UMCS(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual UMCS(4)

NAME

umcs — USB support
for serial adapters based on the MCS7820 and MCS7840
chips

SYNOPSIS

To compile this driver into the
kernel, place the following lines in your kernel
configuration file:

device usb

device ucom 
device umcs

Alternatively,
to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following line in loader.conf(5):

umcs_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION

The umcs driver provides
support for various multiport serial adapters based on the
MosCom MCS7820 and MCS7840 chips. They are 2- or 4-port
adapters with full-featured 16550-compatible UARTs and very
flexible baud generators. Also, these chips support
RS422/RS485 and IrDA operations.

The device is
accessed through the ucom(4) driver which makes it behave
like a tty(4).

Different ports
on device are presented as sub-units, like
/dev/ttyU0.1 and /dev/ttyU0.2.

HARDWARE

The umcs driver was
tested on the following adapters:

•

ST Lab U-360 two-port serial
USB adapter

•

ST Lab U-400 four-port serial
USB adapter

BUGS

This driver doesn’t
support access to any fine tunes of chip, like RS522/RS485
mode, non-standard baudrates, etc.
