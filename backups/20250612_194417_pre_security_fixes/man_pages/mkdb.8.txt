NAME

mkdb âˆ’
create a new GNATS database

SYNOPSIS

mkdb
databasename

DESCRIPTION

Looks up
databasename in the GNATS databases file and
creates a database in the location specified there.
mkdb creates the directory and populates it with a
set of default files copied from the
/usr/share/gnats/defaults directory.

Note the
implications of this: an entry in databases must be
created before mkdb is run.

The command
should be run as the GNATS user, by default
gnats.

OPTIONS

databasename

Specifies the name of the
database to be created.
