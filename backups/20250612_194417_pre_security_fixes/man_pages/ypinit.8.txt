NAME

ypinit - NIS
database install and build program

SYNOPSIS

/usr/lib/yp/ypinit [-m]
[-s master_name] 

DESCRIPTION

ypinit
builds the domain subdirectory of /var/yp for the current
default domain. After building the domain subdirectory,
ypinit builds a complete set of administrative maps
for your system and places them in this directory. The first
map created by ypinit -m is the ypservers map. You
should run it as root on the hosts, which should be the
master ypserver.You should have only one master server per
NIS domain.

All databases
are built from scratch, either from information available to
the program at runtime, or from the ASCII data base files in
/etc. These files are listed below under FILES.

An NIS database
on a slave server is set up by copying an existing database
from a running server. The master_name argument
should be the hostname of an NIS server (either the master
server for all the maps, or a server on which the data base
is up-to-date and stable).

OPTIONS

-m

If the local host is the NIS
master.

-s

Set up a slave server with the
database from master_name

FILES

/etc/passwd,
/etc/group, /etc/hosts, /etc/networks, /etc/services,
/etc/protocols, /etc/netgroup, /etc/rpc
