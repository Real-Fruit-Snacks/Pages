PWQGEN(1) BSD General Commands Manual PWQGEN(1)

NAME

pwqgen â€” Generate
quality controllable random passphrase

SYNOPSIS

pwqgen
[options]

DESCRIPTION

The pwqgen program
generates a random passphrase using the libpasswdqc library.
Strength of the generated passphrase depends on the amount
of randomness read from /dev/urandom.

OPTIONS 
random=N

(default: random=47) The
size of randomly-generated passphrase in bits (24 to
136).

config=FILE

Load config FILE in the
passwdqc.conf format. This file may define any
options described in passwdqc.conf(5), but only the
random and config options are honored by
pwqgen.

--version

Output pwqgen program
version and exit.

-h, --help

Output pwqgen help text
and exit.

EXIT STATUS

pwqgen exits with
non-zero status when it encounters invalid config file,
invalid option, invalid parameter value, when it fails to
obtain enough randomness, and in any case when it fails to
generate a passphrase.

FILES

/etc/passwdqc.conf (not
read unless this suggested file location is specified with
the config=/etc/passwdqc.conf option).
