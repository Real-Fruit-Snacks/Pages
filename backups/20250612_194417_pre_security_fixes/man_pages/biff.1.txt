BIFF(1) BSD General Commands Manual BIFF(1)

NAME

biff — be notified
if mail arrives and who it is from

SYNOPSIS

biff [ny]

DESCRIPTION

Biff informs the system
whether you want to be notified when mail arrives during the
current terminal session.

Options
supported by biff:

n

Disables
notification.

y

Enables
notification.

When mail
notification is enabled, the header and first few lines of
the message will be printed on your screen whenever mail
arrives. A ’’biff y’’ command is
often included in the file .login or .profile
to be executed at each login.

Biff
operates asynchronously via the comsat(8) service. If that
service is not enabled, biff will not do anything. In
that case, or for synchronous notification, use the
MAIL variable of sh(1) or the mail variable of
csh(1).

SEE ALSO

csh(1), mail(1), sh(1),
comsat(8)

HISTORY

The biff command appeared
in 4.0BSD.

BUGS

su(1), and biff don’t seem
to get on too well. This is probably due to the tty still
being owned by the person using su. This can result in
’’Permission denied’’ messages when
attempting to change the biff status of your session.

Please report
bugs to netbug [AT] ftp.org including diffs/patches,
compiler error logs or as complete a bug report as is
possible.
