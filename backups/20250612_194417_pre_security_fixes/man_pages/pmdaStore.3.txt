DESCRIPTION

As part of the
Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) API (see
PMDA(3)), pmdaStore is the generic callback
for storing a value into a metric. pmdaStore is
usually a no-op as, by default, no metrics can be altered.
Also, the implementation of a store callback which does
permit metrics to be altered by pmstore(1) is very
application dependent.

CAVEAT

The PMDA must
be using PMDA_PROTOCOL_2 or later, as specified in
the call to pmdaDSO(3) or pmdaDaemon(3).

DIAGNOSTICS

pmdaStore
returns PM_ERR_PERMISSION to indicate that no metrics
may be modified.
