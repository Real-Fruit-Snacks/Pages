sq network -
Retrieve and publish certificates over the network

SYNOPSIS

sq network
fetch [OPTIONS] QUERY 
sq network keyserver [OPTIONS] SUBCOMMAND

sq network wkd [OPTIONS] SUBCOMMAND

sq network dane [OPTIONS] SUBCOMMAND

DESCRIPTION

Retrieve and
publish certificates over the network.

OpenPGP
certificates can be discovered and updated from, and
published on services accessible over the network. This is a
collection of commands to interact with these services.

SUBCOMMANDS

sq network
fetch 
Retrieve certificates using all supported network
services.

This command
will try to locate relevant certificates given a query,
which may be a fingerprint, a key ID, an email address, or a
https URL. It may also discover and import certificate
related to the one queried, such as alternative certs,
expired certs, or revoked certs.

Discovering
related certs is useful: alternative certs support key
rotations, expired certs allow verification of signatures
made in the past, and discovering revoked certs is important
to get the revocation information. The PKI mechanism will
help to select the correct cert, see ’sq
pki’.

By default, any
returned certificates are stored in the local certificate
store. This can be overridden by using
’--output’ option.

When a
certificate is retrieved from a verifying key server
(currently, this is limited to a list of known servers:
’hkps://keys.openpgp.org’,
’hkps://keys.mailvelope.com’, and
’hkps://mail-api.proton.me’), WKD, DANE, or via
https, and imported into the local certificate store, the
User IDs are also certificated with a local server-specific
key. That proxy certificate is in turn certified as a
minimally trusted CA (trust amount: 1 of 120) by the local
trust root. How much a proxy key server CA is trusted can be
tuned using ’sq pki link add’ or ’sq pki
link retract’ in the usual way.

sq network
keyserver 
Retrieve and publishes certificates via key servers.

The OpenPGP
HTTP Keyserver Protocol (HKP) is a method for publishing and
retrieving certificates from key servers.

sq network
wkd 
Retrieve and publishes certificates via Web Key
Directories.

The Web Key
Directory (WKD) is a method for publishing and retrieving
certificates from web servers.

sq network
dane 
Retrieve and publishes certificates via DANE.

DNS-Based
Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) is a method for
publishing and retrieving certificates in DNS as specified
in RFC 7929.
