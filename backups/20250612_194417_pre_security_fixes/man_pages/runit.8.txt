NAME

runit - a UNIX
process no 1

SYNOPSIS

runit

DESCRIPTION

runit
must be run as Unix process no 1. It performs the
system’s booting, running, and shutdown in three
stages:

STAGE 1

runit
runs /etc/runit/1 and waits for it to terminate. The
system’s one time tasks are done here.
/etc/runit/1 has full control of /dev/console
to be able to start an emergency shell if the one time
initialization tasks fail. If /etc/runit/1 crashes,
or exits 100, runit will skip stage 2 and enter stage
3.

STAGE 2

runit
runs /etc/runit/2, which should not return until
system shutdown; if it crashes, or exits 111, it will be
restarted. Normally /etc/runit/2 starts
runsvdir(8). runit is able to handle the
ctrl-alt-del keyboard request in stage 2, see below.

STAGE 3

If runit
is told to shutdown the system, or stage 2 returns, it
terminates stage 2 if it is running, and runs
/etc/runit/3. The systems tasks to shutdown and
possibly halt or reboot the system are done here. If stage 3
returns, runit checks if the file
/run/runit.reboot exists and has the execute by owner
permission set. If so, the system is rebooted, it’s
halted otherwise. If /etc/runit/nosync exists,
runit doesn’t invoke sync(). This is useful in
vservers.

CTRL-ALT-DEL

If runit
receives the ctrl-alt-del keyboard request and the file
/etc/runit/ctrlaltdel exists and has the execute by
owner permission set, runit runs
/etc/runit/ctrlaltdel, waits for it to terminate, and
then sends itself a CONT signal.

SIGNALS

runit
only accepts signals in stage 2.

If runit
receives a CONT signal and the file /run/runit.stopit
exists and has the execute by owner permission set,
runit is told to shutdown the system.

If runit
receives a PWR signal, runit is told to shutdown the
system.

if runit
receives an INT signal, a ctrl-alt-del keyboard request is
triggered.

ENVIRONMENT

When the
runitdir=name variable is set and runit is
init, runit will check if a directory named
name exists in /etc/runit/runsvdir/ and then
will use runsvchdir to change the directory of
runsvdir to name in place of the default.

If
runitdir is set to runitdir=solo runit
will use the solo directory for runsvdir and
it will also refrain from start any sysv service that is
enabled in /etc/rc2.d/ This is intended for use with
containers that need to start only some selected
services.
