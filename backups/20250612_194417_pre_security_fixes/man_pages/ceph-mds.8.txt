NAME

ceph-mds - ceph
metadata server daemon

SYNOPSIS

ceph-mds
-i ID> [flags]

DESCRIPTION

ceph-mds
is the metadata server daemon for the Ceph distributed file
system. One or more instances of ceph-mds collectively
manage the file system namespace, coordinating access to the
shared OSD cluster.

Each ceph-mds
daemon instance should have a unique name. The name is used
to identify daemon instances in the ceph.conf.

Once the daemon
has started, the monitor cluster will normally assign it a
logical rank, or put it in a standby pool to take over for
another daemon that crashes. Some of the specified options
can cause other behaviors.

OPTIONS

-f,
--foreground

Foreground: do not daemonize
after startup (run in foreground). Do not generate a pid
file. Useful when run via ceph-run(8).

-d

Debug mode: like -f, but also send all log output
to stderr.

--setuser userorgid

Set uid after starting. If a
username is specified, the user record is looked up to get a
uid and a gid, and the gid is also set as well, unless
--setgroup is also specified.

--setgroup
grouporgid

Set gid after starting. If a
group name is specified the group record is looked up to get
a gid.

-c ceph.conf,
--conf=ceph.conf

Use ceph.conf
configuration file instead of the default
/etc/ceph/ceph.conf to determine monitor addresses
during startup.

-m monaddress[:port]

Connect to specified monitor
(instead of looking through ceph.conf).

--id/-i ID

Set ID portion of the MDS
name.

AVAILABILITY

ceph-mds
is part of Ceph, a massively scalable, open-source,
distributed storage system. Please refer to the Ceph
documentation at http://ceph.com/docs for more
