NAME

firewalld.service
- firewalld service configuration files

SYNOPSIS

/etc/firewalld/services/service.xml

/usr/lib/firewalld/services/service.xml

DESCRIPTION

A firewalld
service configuration file provides the information of a
service entry for firewalld. The most important
configuration options are ports, modules and destination
addresses.

This example
configuration file shows the structure of a service
configuration file:

My Service 
description

137"
protocol="tcp"/> 
igmp"/> 
nf_conntrack_netbios_ns"/> 
224.0.0.251"
ipv6="ff02::fb"/> 
ssdp"/> 
ftp"/> 

OPTIONS

The config can
contain these tags and attributes. Some of them are
mandatory, others optional.

service

The mandatory service start and end tag defines the service.
This tag can only be used once in a service configuration
file. There are optional attributes for services:

version="string"

To give the service a
version.

short

Is an optional start and end tag and is used to give an
service a more readable name.

description

Is an optional start and end tag to have a description for a
service.

port

Is an optional empty-element tag and can be used several
times to have more than one port entry. All attributes of a
port entry are mandatory:

port="string"

The port string can be a
single port number or a port range
portid-portid or also empty to match a
protocol only.

protocol="string"

The protocol value can either
be tcp, udp, sctp or dccp.

For
compatibility with older firewalld versions, it is possible
to add protocols with the port option where the port is
empty. With the addition of native protocol support in the
service, this it not needed anymore. These entries will
automatically be converted to protocols. With the next
modification of the service file, the enries will be listed
as protocols.

protocol

Is an optional empty-element tag and can be used several
times to have more than one protocol entry. A protocol entry
has exactly one attribute:

value="string"

The protocol can be any
protocol supported by the system. Please have a look at
/etc/protocols for supported protocols.

source-port

Is an optional empty-element tag and can be used several
times to have more than one source port entry. All
attributes of a source port entry are mandatory:

port="string"

The port string can be a
single port number or a port range
portid-portid.

protocol="string"

The protocol value can either
be tcp, udp, sctp or dccp.

module

This element is deprecated. Please use helper described
below in the section called “helper”.

destination

Is an optional empty-element tag and can be used only once.
The destination specifies the destination network as a
network IP address (optional with /mask), or a plain IP
address. The use of hostnames is not recommended, because
these will only be resolved at service activation and
transmitted to the kernel. For more information in this
element, please have a look at --destination in
iptables(8) and ip6tables(8).

ipv4="address[/mask]"

The IPv4 destination address
with optional mask.

ipv6="address[/mask]"

The IPv6 destination address
with optional mask.

include

Is an optional empty-element tag and can be used several
times to have more than one include entry. An include entry
has exactly one attribute:

service="string"

The include can be any service
supported by firewalld.

Warning:Firewalld
will only check that the included service is a valid
service if it's applied to a zone.

helper

Is an optional empty-element tag and can be used several
times to have more than one helper entry. An helper entry
has exactly one attribute:

name="string"

The helper can be any helper
supported by firewalld.
