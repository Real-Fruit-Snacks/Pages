NAME

pmLookupText
- return text describing a performance metric

C SYNOPSIS

#include

int
pmLookupText(pmID pmid, int
level, char **buffer);

cc ...
-lpcp

DESCRIPTION

Retrieve
descriptive text about the performance metric identified by
pmid.

The argument
level should be either PM_TEXT_ONELINE for a
one-line summary, else PM_TEXT_HELP for a more
verbose description, suited to a help dialog.

The space
pointed to by buffer will have been allocated in
pmLookupText with malloc(3), and it is the
responsibility of the caller to free(3) the space
when it is no longer required.

pmLookupText
returns zero on success.

DIAGNOSTICS

PM_ERR_NOTHOST

For archives created with
versions of PCP prior to 4.0, if the current PMAPI context
is an archive (help and one-line text was previously not
maintained in the archives)
