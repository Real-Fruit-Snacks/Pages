NAME

nbdkit-ext2-filter
- read and write files inside ext2, ext3 or ext4
filesystems

SYNOPSIS

nbdkit
--filter=ext2 file fs.img ext2file=/disks/disk.raw

nbdkit
--filter=ext2 --filter=partition file fs.img \ 
partition=1 ext2file=exportname

DESCRIPTION

"nbdkit-ext2-filter"
is an nbdkit filter which can read and write files inside
ext2, ext3 or ext4 filesystem images.

Suppose you
have an ext2/3/4 filesystem image called fs.img which
contains inside itself a file called disk.raw inside
a directory on the filesystem called /disks, then you
could serve that file over NBD using:

nbdkit
--filter=ext2 file fs.img ext2file=/disks/disk.raw

Commonly disk
images are partitioned. In that case, you must select just
the partition of a disk image that contains an ext2
filesystem, by using nbdkit-partition-filter(1):

nbdkit
--filter=ext2 --filter=partition file fs.img \ 
partition=1 ext2file=/disks/disk.raw

This filter can
both read and write to the file inside the filesystem. Use
the -r flag to force a readonly connection, but note
this does not guarantee that no writes are made to
the filesystem. In particular we may have to replay the ext3
journal in order to open a filesystem even read-only.

The filter does
not support multiple parallel connections, because
there is a risk of corrupting the filesystem (as if the
filesystem was mounted by multiple machines). If a second
connection is made to nbdkit, it will block until the first
connection closes.

The filter is
implemented using the ext2fs library which is provided in
most Linux distros, and also available as part of the
e2fsprogs project.

nbdkit-guestfs-plugin(1)
is a more generic plugin which can read files from all kinds
of different filesystem types, even if they are partitioned
or use logical volumes. It uses libguestfs instead of
e2fsprogs.

PARAMETERS

ext2file=PATH

The full path of the file
within the filesystem that will be exposed over NBD. The
path must be absolute (starts with "/").

ext2file=exportname

The plugin will expose the path
within the filesystem chosen by the exportname passed by the
client. Note that this mode allows the client to deduce
which files exist within the disk image, which may be a
security risk in some situations.

At present,
when using this mode, the server does not advertise any
particular exports; however, you may use
nbdkit-exportname-filter(1) to perform that task.
Similarly, the underlying plugin must support the default
export name, "".

FILES

$filterdir/nbdkit-ext2-filter.so

The filter.

Use
"nbdkit --dump-config" to find the location of
$filterdir.

VERSION

"nbdkit-ext2-filter"
first appeared in nbdkit 1.18, replacing
"nbdkit-ext2-plugin" which was added in nbdkit 1.4
and removed in nbdkit 1.22.
