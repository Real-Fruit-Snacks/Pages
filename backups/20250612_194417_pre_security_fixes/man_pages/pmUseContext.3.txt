NAME

pmUseContext
- change current PMAPI context

C SYNOPSIS

#include

int
pmUseContext(int handle);

cc ...

DESCRIPTION

An application
using the Performance Metrics Application Programming
Interface (PMAPI) may manipulate several concurrent
contexts, each associated with a source of performance
metrics, e.g. pmcd(1) on some host, or an archive of
performance metrics as created by pmlogger(1).

Calling
pmUseContext causes the current PMAPI context to be
set to the context identified by handle. The value of
handle must be one returned from an earlier call to
pmNewContext(3) or pmDupContext(3).

Below the
PMAPI, all contexts used by an application are saved in
their most recently modified state, so pmUseContext
restores the context to the state it was in the last time
the context was used, not the state of the context when it
was established.

DIAGNOSTICS

PM_ERR_NOCONTEXT

handle
does not identify a valid PMAPI context
