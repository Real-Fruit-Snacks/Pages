NAME

ppmcolormask -
produce mask of areas of a certain color in a PPM file

SYNOPSIS

ppmcolormask
-color=color_list [ppmfile]

ppmcolormask
color [ppmfile]

EXAMPLES

ppmcolormask
-color red testimg.ppm >redmask.pbm 
pamcomp background.ppm testimg.ppm -alpha=redmask.pbm
>test.ppm

ppmcolormask
-color=red,pink,salmon testimg.ppm >reddishmask.pbm

ppmcolormask
-color=bk:red,bk:orange,bk:yellow testimg.ppm
>firemask.pbm

DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

ppmcolormask
reads a PPM file as input and produces a PBM (bitmap) file
as output. The output file is the same dimensions as the
input file and is black in all places where the input file
is a color indicated by the -color option, and white
everywhere else.

The output of
ppmcolormask is useful as a transparency mask input
to pamcomp. Note that you don’t need
ppmcolormask and pamcomp if you are ultimately
converting to PNG with pnmtopng because the
-transparent option on pnmtopng does the same
thing.

ppmfile
is the input file. If you don’t specify
ppmfile, the input is from Standard Input.

The output goes
to Standard Output.

In the obsolete
alternative syntax, specifying the color names a
single exact color to be masked.

ppmchange
does a similar thing: it modifies an image by changing
colors you specify to other colors you specify. The two
programs give you somewhat different means of specifying
colors in the input image.

To make a mask
of an image’s background, without having to tell it
what color it is, use pambackground.

OPTIONS

In addition to
the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most
notably -quiet, see
 Common Options ),
ppmcolormask recognizes the following command line
option: 
-color=color_list

This mandatory option specifies
the colors that are to be masked (where the image is one of
these colors, the output mask will be black).

Examples:

•

-color=red

•

-color=red,pink,salmon

•

-color=rgb:80/80/ff

•

-color=bk:red,bk:orange,bk:yellow

color_list
is a list of colors separated by commas. Each color is
either an exact color name as described for the
argument of the
pnm_parsecolor() library routine or one of the
Berlin-Kay color names .
In the latter case, all colors that are better described by
that Berlin-Kay color name than any other are in the mask
set.

The algorithm
ppmcolormask uses to determine to which colors a
Berlin-Kay color name applies is based on a Sugeno-type
fuzzy inference system developed by Kenan Kalajdzic
in 2006. The fuzzy model consists of partially linear
membership functions defined in the HSV color space.
Although more complex algorithms for fuzzy color matching
exist, this algorithm is intentionally simplified to achieve
a satisfactory speed using relatively compact code.

This option was
new in Netpbm 10.34 (June 2006). Before that, you must use
the color argument and cannot specify a Berlin-Kay
color.
