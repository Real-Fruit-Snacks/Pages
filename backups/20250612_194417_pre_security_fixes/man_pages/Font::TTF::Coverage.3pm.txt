NAME
       Font::TTF::Coverage - Opentype coverage and class definition objects

DESCRIPTION
       Coverage tables and class definition objects are virtually identical
       concepts in OpenType. Their difference comes purely in their storage.
       Therefore we can say that a coverage table is a class definition in
       which the class definition for each glyph is the corresponding index in
       the coverage table. The resulting data structure is that a Coverage
       table has the following fields:

       cover
           A boolean to indicate whether this table is a coverage table (TRUE)
           or a class definition (FALSE)

       val A hash of glyph ids against values (either coverage index or class
           value)

       fmt The storage format used is given here, but is recalculated when the
           table is written out.

       count
           A count of the elements in a coverage table for use with add. Each
           subsequent addition is added with the current count and increments
           the count.

       max Maximum class value in a class table.

METHODS
   new($isCover [, vals])
       Creates a new coverage table or class definition table, depending upon
       the value of $isCover. if $isCover then vals may be a list of glyphs to
       include in order.  If no $isCover, then vals is a hash of glyphs
       against class values.

   read($fh)
       Reads the coverage/class table from the given file handle

   out($fh, $state)
       Writes the coverage/class table to the given file handle. If $state is
       1 then the output string is returned rather than being output to a
       filehandle.

   $c->add($glyphid[, $class])
       Adds a glyph id to the coverage or class table.  Returns the index or
       class number of the glyphid added.

   $c->signature
       Returns a vector of all the glyph ids covered by this coverage table or
       class

   @map=$c->sort
       Sorts the coverage table so that indexes are in ascending order of
       glyphid.  Returns a map such that $map[$new_index]=$old_index.

   $c->out_xml($context)
       Outputs this coverage/class in XML
