NAME

netromd - Send
and receive NET/ROM routing messages

SYNOPSIS

netromd [-c]
[-d] [-i] [-l] [-p pause] [-q quality] [-t interval]
[-v]

DESCRIPTION

For a NET/ROM
based network to operate correctly, a periodic broadcast of
routing information needs to occur. Typically this occurs
once every hour on every port which is expected to carry
NET/ROM traffic. The purpose of netromd is to send
and receive NET/ROM routing broadcasts. To operate correctly
a set of parameters that corresponds to each AX.25 port
needs to be passed to the program. This information is
encoded in a configuration file, by default which is
/etc/ax25/nrbroadcast with each line representing one port,
see the manual page for nrbroadcast(5).

To cut down the
length of these routing broadcasts, only the information
about the highest quality neighbour for a particular node is
transmitted. The transmission is also limited to those node
that have a certain minimum value in their obsolesence
count, this value is decremented every time a routing
broadcast is transmitted, and is refreshed by receiving a
routing broadcast which contains that particular node.

The value of
the default quality is traditionally assigned a value that
represents the quality of the radio links on that port. A
higher number representing better radio links with 255 (the
maximum) reserved for wire connections. The practise in the
UK is to set the default quality to a low value, typically
10, and manually set up the trusted neighbouring nodes in
the neighbour list manually. The worst quality for
auto-updates value is a way to filter out low quality (ie
distant) nodes.

The verbose
flag may be either 0 or 1, representing no and yes. By
specifying no, the program will only generate a routing
message containing information about the node on which it is
running, by specifying the yes option, all the information
in the nodes routing tables will be transmitted. The quality
advertised for the other node callsigns on this machine may
be set using the -q option.

Between each
transmission netromd pauses for five seconds
(default) in order to avoid flooding the channels that it
must broadcast on. The value of this delay is settable with
the -p option.

OPTIONS

-c

Forces strict compliance to
Software 2000 specifications. At present this only
determines how node mnemonics with lower case characters
will be handled. With compliance enabled mixed case node
mnemonics will be ignored. The default is to accept node
mnemonics of mixed case.

-d

Switches on debugging messages, the default is off.
Logging must be enabled for them to be output.

-i

Transmit a routing broadcast immediately, the default is
to wait for the time interval to elapse before transmitting
the first routing broadcast.

-l

Enables logging of errors and debug messages to the
system log. The default is off.

-p pause

Sets the delay between transmissions of individual
routing broadcast packets. The default is five seconds.

-q quality

Sets the quality of the subsidiary nodes relative to the
main node. The default is 255.

-t interval

The time interval between routing broadcasts, in
minutes. The default is 60 minutes.

-v

Display the version.
