NAME
       "XS::Parse::Infix::Builder" - build-time support for "XS::Parse::Infix"

SYNOPSIS
       In Build.PL:

          use XS::Parse::Infix::Builder;

          my $build = Module::Build->new(
             ...,
             configure_requires => {
                ...
                'XS::Parse::Infix::Builder' => 0,
             }
          );

          XS::Parse::Infix::Builder->extend_module_build( $build );

          ...

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides a build-time helper to assist authors writing XS
       modules that use XS::Parse::Infix. It prepares a Module::Build-using
       distribution to be able to make use of "XS::Parse::Infix".

FUNCTIONS
   write_XSParseInfix_h
          XS::Parse::Infix::Builder->write_XSParseInfix_h

       Writes the XSParseInfix.h file to the current working directory. To
       cause the compiler to actually find this file, see
       "extra_compiler_flags".

   extra_compiler_flags
          @flags = XS::Parse::Infix::Builder->extra_compiler_flags

       Returns a list of extra flags that the build scripts should add to the
       compiler invocation. This enables the C compiler to find the
       XSParseInfix.h file.

   extend_module_build
          XS::Parse::Infix::Builder->extend_module_build( $build )

       A convenient shortcut for performing all the tasks necessary to make a
       Module::Build-based distribution use the helper.
