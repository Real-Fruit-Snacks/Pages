CHKGRP(8)

NAME

chkgrp — check the
syntax of the group file

SYNOPSIS

chkgrp
[groupfile]

DESCRIPTION

The chkgrp utility scans
the given file or, failing that, the system-wide group file
for errors. Specifically, it checks that every non-blank,
non-comment entry is composed of four colon-separated
fields, that none of them contains whitespace, and that the
third field (the group ID) is numeric.

FILES 
/etc/group

group database
file

SEE ALSO

getgrent(3), group(5)

DIAGNOSTICS

For each error found,
chkgrp will print an error message containing the
name of the file being scanned and the line number on which
the error was found. Otherwise no output is produced.

The
chkgrp utility returns EX_DATAERR if errors were
found in the group file, and EX_OK otherwise.

HISTORY

The chkgrp utility
appeared in FreeBSD 3.0.

AUTHORS

The chkgrp utility and
this manual page were written by Dag-Erling Smørgrav

BUGS

Should check fields more
thoroughly for allowed/disallowed characters, and the range
of the group ID.
