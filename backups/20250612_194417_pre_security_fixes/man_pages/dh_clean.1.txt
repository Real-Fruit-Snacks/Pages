NAME

dh_clean -
clean up package build directories

SYNOPSIS

dh_clean
[debhelper options] [-k] [-d]
[-Xitem] [path ...]

DESCRIPTION

dh_clean
is a debhelper program that is responsible for cleaning up.
It should be the last step of the clean target and
other debhelper commands generally assume that
dh_clean will clean up after them.

It removes the
package build directories, and removes some other files
including debian/files, and any detritus left behind
by other debhelper commands. It also removes common files
that should not appear in a Debian diff: 
#*# *~ DEADJOE *.orig *.rej *.SUMS
TAGS .deps/* *.P *-stamp

It does not run
"make clean" to clean up after the build process.
Use dh_auto_clean(1) to do things like that.

FILES

debian/clean

Can list other paths to be
removed.

Note that
directories listed in this file must end with a
trailing slash. Any content in these directories will be
removed as well.

Supports
substitution variables in compat 13 and later as documented
in debhelper(7).

OPTIONS

-k,
--keep

This is deprecated, use
dh_prep(1) instead.

The option is
removed in compat 12.

-d,
--dirs-only

Only clean the package build
directories, do not clean up any other files at all.

-Xitem
--exclude=item

Exclude files that contain
item anywhere in their filename from being deleted,
even if they would normally be deleted. You may use this
option multiple times to build up a list of things to
exclude.

path ...

Delete these paths
too.

Note that
directories passed as arguments must end with a
trailing slash. Any content in these directories will be
removed as well.

SEE ALSO

This program is
a part of debhelper.
