NAME

git-annex-forget
- prune git-annex branch history

SYNOPSIS

git annex
forget

DESCRIPTION

Causes the
git-annex branch to be rewritten, throwing away historical
data about past locations of files. The resulting branch
will use less space, but git annex log will not be
able to show where files used to be located.

When this
rewritten branch is merged into other clones of the
repository, git-annex will automatically perform the
same rewriting to their local git-annex branches. So
the forgetfulness will automatically propagate out from its
starting point until all repositories running git-annex have
forgotten their old history. (You may need to force git to
push the branch to any git repositories not running
git-annex.)

OPTIONS

--drop-dead

Also prune
references to repositories that have been marked as
dead.

Also the
git-annex-common-options(1) can be used.
