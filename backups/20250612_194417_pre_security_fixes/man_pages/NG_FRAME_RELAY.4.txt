NG_FRAME_RELAY(4)

NAME

ng_frame_relay —
frame relay netgraph node type

SYNOPSIS

#include

DESCRIPTION

The frame_relay node type
performs encapsulation, de-encapsulation, and multiplexing
of packets using the frame relay protocol. It supports up to
1024 DLCI’s. The LMI protocol is handled by a separate
node type (see ng_lmi(4)).

The downstream
hook should be connected to the synchronous line, i.e., the
switch. Then hooks dlci0, dlci1, through dlci1023 are
available to connect to each of the DLCI channels.

HOOKS

This node type supports the
following hooks:

downstream

The connection
to the synchronous line.

dlciX

Here X is a
decimal number from 0 to 1023. This hook corresponds to the
DLCI X frame relay virtual channel.

CONTROL MESSAGES

This node type supports only the
generic control messages.

SHUTDOWN

This node shuts down upon
receipt of a NGM_SHUTDOWN control message, or when all hooks
have been disconnected.

SEE ALSO

netgraph(4), ng_lmi(4),
ngctl(8)

HISTORY

The ng_frame_relay node
type was implemented in FreeBSD 4.0.

BUGS

Technically, frames on DLCI X
should not be transmitted to the switch until the LMI
protocol entity on both ends has configured DLCI X as
active. The ng_frame_relay node type ignores this
restriction, and will always pass data received on a DLCI
hook to downstream. Instead, it should query the LMI node
first.
