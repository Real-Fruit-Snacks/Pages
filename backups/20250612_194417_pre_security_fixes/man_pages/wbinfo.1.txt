DESCRIPTION

This tool is
part of the samba(7) suite.

The wbinfo
program queries and returns information created and used by
the winbindd(8) daemon.

The
winbindd(8) daemon must be configured and running for
the wbinfo program to be able to return information.

OPTIONS

-a|--authenticate
username%password

Attempt to authenticate a user
via winbindd(8). This checks both authentication
methods and reports its results.

Note

Do not be tempted to use this functionality for
authentication in third-party applications. Instead use
ntlm_auth(1).

--allocate-gid

Get a new GID out of
idmap

--allocate-uid

Get a new UID out of
idmap

--all-domains

List all domains (trusted
and own domain).

-c|--change-secret

Change the trust account
password. May be used in conjunction with domain in
order to change interdomain trust account
passwords.

--change-secret-at
domain-controller

Change the trust account
password at a specific domain controller. Fails if the
specified domain controller cannot be contacted.

--ccache-save
username%password

Store user and password
for ccache.

--change-user-password
username

Change the password of a
user. The old and new password will be prompted.

--dc-info
domain

Displays information about
the current domain controller for a domain.

--domain
name

This parameter sets the
domain on which any specified operations will performed. If
special domain name '.' is used to represent the current
domain to which winbindd(8) belongs. A '*' as the
domain name means to enumerate over all domains (NOTE: This
can take a long time and use a lot of memory).

-D|--domain-info
domain

Show most of the info we
have about the specified domain.

--dsgetdcname
domain

Find a DC for a
domain.

--gid-info
gid

Get group info from
gid.

--group-info
group

Get group info from group
name.

-g|--domain-groups

This option will list all
groups available in the Windows NT domain for which the
samba(7) daemon is operating in. Groups in all
trusted domains can be listed with the --domain='*' option.
Note that this operation does not assign group ids to any
groups that have not already been seen by
winbindd(8).

--get-auth-user

Print username and
password used by winbindd(8) during session setup to
a domain controller. Username and password can be set using
--set-auth-user. Only available for root.

--getdcname
domain

Get the DC name for the
specified domain.

-G|--gid-to-sid
gid

Try to convert a UNIX
group id to a Windows NT SID. If the gid specified does not
refer to one within the idmap gid range then the operation
will fail.

-?

Print brief help
overview.

-i|--user-info
user

Get user info.

-I|--WINS-by-ip
ip

The -I option
queries winbindd(8) to send a node status request to
get the NetBIOS name associated with the IP address
specified by the ip parameter.

-K|--krb5auth
username%password

Attempt to authenticate a
user via Kerberos.

--krb5ccname
KRB5CCNAME

Allows one to request a
specific kerberos credential cache type used for
authentication.

--lanman

Use lanman cryptography
for user authentication.

--logoff

Logoff a user.

--logoff-uid
UID

Define user uid used
during logoff request.

--logoff-user
USERNAME

Define username used
during logoff request.

--lookup-sids
SID1,SID2...

Looks up SIDs. SIDs must
be specified as ASCII strings in the traditional Microsoft
format. For example,
S-1-5-21-1455342024-3071081365-2475485837-500.

-m|--trusted-domains

Produce a list of domains
trusted by the Windows NT server winbindd(8) contacts
when resolving names. This list does not include the Windows
NT domain the server is a Primary Domain Controller
for.

-n|--name-to-sid
name

The -n option
queries winbindd(8) for the SID associated with the
name specified. Domain names can be specified before the
user name by using the winbind separator character. For
example CWDOM1/Administrator refers to the Administrator
user in the domain CWDOM1. If no domain is specified then
the domain used is the one specified in the
smb.conf(5) workgroup parameter.

-N|--WINS-by-name
name

The -N option
queries winbindd(8) to query the WINS server for the
IP address associated with the NetBIOS name specified by the
name parameter.

--ntlmv1

Use NTLMv1 cryptography
for user authentication.

--ntlmv2

Use NTLMv2 cryptography
for user authentication. NTLMv2 is the default method, this
option is only maintained for compatibility.

--online-status
domain

Display whether winbind
currently maintains an active connection or not. An optional
domain argument limits the output to the online status of a
given domain.

--own-domain

List own domain.

--pam-logon
username%password

Attempt to authenticate a
user in the same way pam_winbind would do.

-p|--ping

Check whether
winbindd(8) is still alive. Prints out either
'succeeded' or 'failed'.

-P|--ping-dc

Issue a no-effect command
to our DC. This checks if our secure channel connection to
our domain controller is still alive. It has much less
impact than wbinfo -t.

-r|--user-groups
username

Try to obtain the list of
UNIX group ids to which the user belongs. This only works
for users defined on a Domain Controller.

There are
two scenaries:

1. User
authenticated: When the user has been authenticated, the
access token for the user is cached. The correct group
memberships are then returned from the cached user token
(which can be outdated).

2. User
*NOT* authenticated: The information is queries from the
domain controller using the machine account credentials
which have limited permissions. The result is normally
incomplete and can be also incorrect.

-R|--lookup-rids
rid1, rid2, rid3...

Converts RIDs to names.
Uses a comma separated list of rids.

--remove-gid-mapping
GID,SID

Removes an existing GID to
SID mapping from the database.

--remove-uid-mapping
UID,SID

Removes an existing UID to
SID mapping from the database.

-s|--sid-to-name
sid

Use -s to resolve a
SID to a name. This is the inverse of the -n option
above. SIDs must be specified as ASCII strings in the
traditional Microsoft format. For example,
S-1-5-21-1455342024-3071081365-2475485837-500.

--separator

Get the active winbind
separator.

--sequence

This command has been
deprecated. Please use the --online-status option
instead.

--set-auth-user
username%password

Store username and
password used by winbindd(8) during session setup to
a domain controller. This enables winbindd to operate in a
Windows 2000 domain with Restrict Anonymous turned on
(a.k.a. Permissions compatible with Windows 2000 servers
only).

--set-gid-mapping
GID,SID

Create a GID to SID
mapping in the database.

--set-uid-mapping
UID,SID

Create a UID to SID
mapping in the database.

-S|--sid-to-uid
sid

Convert a SID to a UNIX
user id. If the SID does not correspond to a UNIX user
mapped by winbindd(8) then the operation will
fail.

--sid-aliases
sid

Get SID aliases for a
given SID.

--sid-to-fullname
sid

Converts a SID to a full
username (DOMAIN\username).

--sids-to-unix-ids
sid1,sid2,sid3...

Resolve SIDs to Unix IDs.
SIDs must be specified as ASCII strings in the traditional
Microsoft format. For example,
S-1-5-21-1455342024-3071081365-2475485837-500.

-t|--check-secret

Verify that the
workstation trust account created when the Samba server is
added to the Windows NT domain is working. May be used in
conjunction with domain in order to verify
interdomain trust accounts.

-u|--domain-users

This option will list all
users available in the Windows NT domain for which the
winbindd(8) daemon is operating in. Users in all
trusted domains can be listed with the --domain='*' option.
Note that this operation does not assign user ids to any
users that have not already been seen by winbindd(8)
.

--uid-info
uid

Get user info for the user
connected to user id UID.

--usage

Print brief help
overview.

--user-domgroups
sid

Get user domain
groups.

--user-sidinfo
sid

Get user info by
sid.

--user-sids
sid

Get user group SIDs for
user.

-U|--uid-to-sid
uid

Try to convert a UNIX user
id to a Windows NT SID. If the uid specified does not refer
to one within the idmap range then the operation will
fail.

--verbose

Print additional
information about the query results.

-Y|--sid-to-gid
sid

Convert a SID to a UNIX
group id. If the SID does not correspond to a UNIX group
mapped by winbindd(8) then the operation will
fail.

-V|--version

Prints the program version
number.

-?|--help

Print a summary of command
line options.

--usage

Display brief usage
message.

EXIT STATUS

The wbinfo
program returns 0 if the operation succeeded, or 1 if the
operation failed. If the winbindd(8) daemon is not
working wbinfo will always return failure.

kernel is developed.

wbinfo and
winbindd were written by Tim Potter.

The
conversion to DocBook for Samba 2.2 was done by Gerald
Carter. The conversion to DocBook XML 4.2 for Samba 3.0 was
