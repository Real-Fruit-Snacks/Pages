NAME

dpt-clean-mr-repos
- remove local repos which are gone from
salsa.debian.org

SYNOPSIS

dpt
clean-mr-repos [--force] [--help]

DESCRIPTION

dpt
clean-mr-repos checks which repos are locally in the
DPT_PACKAGES directory that do no
longer exist in .mrconfig.packages, i.e. which are no
longer on salsa.debian.org in the group with active
packages. The script needs dpt salsa mrconfig to be
run beforehand as this creates .mrconfig.packages.
Removal of obsolete repos happens only with
--force.

OPTIONS

--help

Show this help.

--force

Actually remove the local
repositories. Without --force they are just
listed.

CONFIGURATION

dpt
clean-mr-repos uses the
"DPT_PACKAGES" environment variable.

See
dpt-config(5) for details.
