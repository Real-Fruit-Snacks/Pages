NAME

pamtopam - copy
PAM image

SYNOPSIS

pamtopam

DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

pamtopam
simply copies a PAM image from Standard Input to Standard
Output. This may seem an unnecessary duplication of
cat, but remember that a PAM program can read a PBM,
PGM, or PPM image as if it were PAM. So pamtopam can
read either a PBM, PGM, PPM, or PAM image and produce a PAM
image as output.

Even that is of
limited usefulness because of the fact that almost any
program to which you would feed the resulting PAM image
could also just take the original image directly. However,
sometimes you really want a true PAM image.

You can do a
more general job of translating PAM/PNM to PAM with
pamchannel.

OPTIONS

There are no
command line options defined specifically for
