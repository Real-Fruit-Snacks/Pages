NAME

pmidi - A midi
file player for ALSA.

SYNOPSIS

pmidi [
-pclient:port ] [ -l ] [
-ddelay ] file...

DESCRIPTION

The
pmidi command reads in the specified midi files and
plays them through the ALSA sequencer. You can specify on
the command line which sequencer port that you wish to use.
Use the -l option to get a list of possible sequencer
ports for your machine.

OPTIONS 
-pclient:port

Specify the ALSA port to send
the midi file to.

-l

List the possible output ports that could be used.

-ddelay

Delay after song ends. This is
used to prevent the last note of a song being chopped off
early. The default is two seconds.

Port
numbers 
You can specify client:port numbers in the ALSA_OUTPUT_PORTS
environment variable. You can also supply a comma (or space
if quoted correctly) separated list of client:port numbers.
This will allow you to play midi files that use more than 16
channels.

Examples

pmidi song.mid song2.mid 
pmidi -p "64:0, 64:1" song.mid

TROUBLE SHOOTING

Before you
start you need to have ALSA installed and
configured correctly. This man page cannot cover all general
ALSA topics, but here are a few things to
check when things do not seem to be working.

Checking
ALSA

1.

First check that the correct sequencer modules are
loaded for your sound card:

-

For a card with an external Midi
connection, you need to load snd-seq-midi.

-

For the OPL2/3 internal synthesiser you need to load
snd-synth-opl3. 

-

For the AWE32/64 internal synthesiser you need to load
snd-synth-emu8000. 

-

For the SB Live! internal synthesiser you need to load
snd-synth-emu10k1. 

-

(Let me know of any more)

2a

If you have an
AWE32/64 or SB Live! you will need to load the sounds with
sfxload in the same way as for the standard kernel
drivers.

2b

If you have the OPL3 FM
synthesiser you will have to load the FM instruments with
sbiload. See note below.

3.

Make sure that the synth in the mixer is turned up and
unmuted if appropriate.

Before
use 
Because you may have more than one sound card and each sound
card may have several MIDI connections, you have to tell
pmidi which one to use.

First find out
what the possibilities are for your system:

If you run:

pmidi -l

it will give you a list of the
possible devices that it can play to. On my system I
get:

Any of the port
numbers in the first column can be used with pmidi. In the
example above the first one is the external Midi port, the
next four are the internal wave table synthesiser. Then
there are two software synthesisers running, FluidSynth
(http://www.fluidsynth.org) and Timididy.

If you
don’t see anything listed then check that the correct
ALSA modules are loaded as in the section "Checking
ALSA".
