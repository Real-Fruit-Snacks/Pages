NAME

sq pki lookup -
Lookup the certificates associated with a User ID

SYNOPSIS

sq pki
lookup [OPTIONS] USERID

DESCRIPTION

Lookup the
certificates associated with a User ID.

Identifies
authenticated bindings (User ID and certificate pairs) where
the User ID matches the specified User ID.

If a binding
could be authenticated to the specified level (by default:
fully authenticated, i.e., a trust amount of 120), then the
exit status is 0. Otherwise the exit status is 1.

If a binding
could be partially authenticated (i.e., its trust amount is
greater than 0), then the binding is displayed, even if the
trust is below the specified threshold.

OPTIONS

Subcommand
options 
-a, --amount=AMOUNT

The required amount of
trust.

120 indicates
full authentication; values less than 120 indicate partial
authentication. When ’--certification-network’
is passed, this defaults to 1200, i.e., ’sq pki’
tries to find 10 paths.

--certification-network

Treats the network as a
certification network.

Normally,
’sq pki’ treats the Web of Trust network as an
authentication network where a certification only means that
the binding is correct, not that the target should be
treated as a trusted introducer. In a certification network,
the targets of certifications are treated as trusted
introducers with infinite depth, and any regular expressions
are ignored. Note: The trust amount remains unchanged. This
is how most so-called PGP path-finding algorithms work.

--email

Changes the USERID parameter to
match User IDs with the specified email address.

Interprets the
USERID parameter as an email address, which is then used to
select User IDs with that email address.

Unlike when
comparing User IDs, email addresses are first normalized by
the domain to ASCII using IDNA2008 Punycode conversion, and
then converting the resulting email address to lowercase
using the empty locale.

If multiple
User IDs match, they are each considered in turn, and this
function returns success if at least one of those User IDs
can be authenticated. Note: The paths to the different User
IDs are not combined.

--gossip

Treats all certificates as
unreliable trust roots.

This option is
useful for figuring out what others think about a
certificate (i.e., gossip or hearsay). In other words, this
finds arbitrary paths to a particular certificate.

Gossip is
useful in helping to identify alternative ways to
authenticate a certificate. For instance, imagine Ed wants
to authenticate Laura’s certificate, but asking her
directly is inconvenient. Ed discovers that Micah has
certified Laura’s certificate, but Ed hasn’t yet
authenticated Micah’s certificate. If Ed is willing to
rely on Micah as a trusted introducer, and authenticating
Micah’s certificate is easier than authenticating
Laura’s certificate, then Ed has learned about an
easier way to authenticate Laura’s certificate.

USERID

The User ID to
authenticate.

This is case
sensitive, and must be the whole User ID, not just a
substring or an email address.

Global
options 
See sq(1) for a description of the global
options.

EXAMPLES

Lookup
certificates that can be authenticated for the given user
ID.

sq pki lookup
"Alice alice [AT] example.org>"

Lookup
certificates that have a user ID with the specified email
address, and that user ID can be authenticated.

sq pki lookup
--email alice [AT] example.org
