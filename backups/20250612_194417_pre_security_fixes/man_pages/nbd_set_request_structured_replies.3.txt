NAME

nbd_set_request_structured_replies
- control use of structured replies

SYNOPSIS

#include

int nbd_set_request_structured_replies ( 
struct nbd_handle *h, bool request 
);

DESCRIPTION

By default,
libnbd tries to negotiate structured replies with the
server, as this protocol extension must be in use before
nbd_can_meta_context(3) or nbd_can_df(3) can
return true. However, for integration testing, it can be
useful to clear this flag rather than find a way to alter
the server to fail the negotiation request. It is also
useful to set this to false prior to using
nbd_set_opt_mode(3) if it is desired to control when
to send nbd_opt_structured_reply(3) during
negotiation.

Note that
setting this knob to false also disables any automatic
request for extended headers.

RETURN VALUE

If the call is
successful the function returns 0.

ERRORS

On error -1 is
returned.

Refer to
"ERROR HANDLING" in libnbd(3) for how to
get further details of the error.

The following
parameters must not be NULL: "h". For more
information see "Non-NULL parameters" in
libnbd(3).
