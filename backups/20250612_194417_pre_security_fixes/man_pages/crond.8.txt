DESCRIPTION

Cron
is automatically started at boot time.

Cron
searches /var/spool/cron/crontabs for crontab files
which are named after user accounts; together with the
system crontab /etc/crontab, the found crontabs are
loaded into the memory. Cron also searches for any
files in the /etc/cron.d directory, which have a
different format (see crontab(5)). Cron
examines all stored crontabs and checks each job to see if
it needs to be run in the current minute. When executing
commands, any output is mailed to the owner of the crontab
(or to the user specified in the MAILTO environment
variable in the crontab, if such exists). Any job output can
also be sent to syslog by using the -s option.

There are two
ways how changes in crontables are checked. The first method
is checking the modtime of a file. The second method is
using inotify support, which is only available on Linux.
When the daemon uses inotify, it logs this fact to syslog on
startup. The inotify support checks for changes in all
crontables and accesses the hard disk only when a change is
detected.

When using the
modtime option, Cron checks its crontables’
modtimes every minute to check for any changes and reloads
the crontables which have changed. There is no need to
restart Cron after some of the crontables were
modified. The modtime option is also used when inotify can
not be initialized.

Cron
checks these files and directories: 
/etc/crontab

system crontab, usually used to
run daily, weekly, monthly jobs. See crontab(5) for
more details.

/etc/cron.d/

directory that contains system
cronjobs stored for different users.

/var/spool/cron/crontabs

directory that contains user
crontables created by the crontab(1) command.

Daylight
Saving Time and other time changes 
Local time changes of less than three hours, such as those
caused by the Daylight Saving Time changes, are handled in a
special way. This only applies to jobs that run at a
specific time and jobs that run with a granularity greater
than one hour. Jobs that run more frequently are scheduled
normally.

If time was
adjusted one hour forward, those jobs that would have run in
the interval that has been skipped will be run immediately.
Conversely, if time was adjusted backward, running the same
job twice is avoided.

Time changes of
more than 3 hours are considered to be corrections to the
clock or the timezone, and the new time is used
immediately.

It is possible
to use different time zones for crontables. See
crontab(5) for more information.

PAM Access
Control 
Cron supports access control with PAM if the system has
PAM installed. For more information, see pam(8). A
PAM configuration file for crond is installed in
/etc/pam.d/crond. The daemon loads the PAM
environment from the pam_env module. This can be overridden
by defining specific settings in the appropriate crontab
file.

OPTIONS

-h

Prints a help message and
exits. 

-i

Disables inotify support.

-m

This option allows you to specify a shell command to use
for sending Cron mail output instead of using
sendmail(8) This command must accept a fully
formatted mail message (with headers) on standard input and
send it as a mail message to the recipients specified in the
mail headers. Specifying the string off will disable
the sending of mail.

-n

Tells the daemon to run in the foreground. This can be
useful when starting it out of init. With this option is
needed to change pam setting. /etc/pam.d/crond must
not enable pam_loginuid.so module.

-f

the same as -n, consistent with other crond
implementations. 

-i

Disables inotify support (if present)

-p

Allows Cron to accept any user set crontables
(read: lift owner, type and mode restrictions)

-P

Don’t set PATH. PATH is instead inherited from the
environment. 

-c

This option enables clustering support, as described
below. 

-s

This option will direct Cron to send the job
output to the system log using syslog(3). This is
useful if your system does not have sendmail(8)
installed or if mail is disabled.

-x

This option allows you to set debug flags.

-V

Print version and exit.

CLUSTERING SUPPORT

In this version
of Cron it is possible to use a network-mounted
shared /var/spool/cron across a cluster of hosts and
specify that only one of the hosts should run the crontab
jobs in this directory at any one time. This is done by
starting Cron with the -c option, and have the
/var/spool/cron/.cron.hostname file contain just one
line, which represents the hostname of whichever host in the
cluster should run the jobs. If this file does not exist, or
the hostname in it does not match that returned by
gethostname(2), then all crontab files in this
directory are ignored. This has no effect on cron jobs
specified in the /etc/crontab file or on files in the
/etc/cron.d directory. These files are always run and
considered host-specific.

Rather than
editing /var/spool/cron/.cron.hostname directly, use
the -n option of crontab(1) to specify the
host.

You should
ensure that all hosts in a cluster, and the file server from
which they mount the shared crontab directory, have closely
synchronised clocks, e.g., using ntpd(8), otherwise
the results will be very unpredictable.

Using cluster
sharing automatically disables inotify support, because
inotify cannot be relied on with network-mounted shared file
systems.

CAVEATS

All
crontab files have to be regular files or symlinks to
regular files, they must not be executable or writable for
anyone else but the owner. This requirement can be
overridden by using the -p option on the crond
command line. If inotify support is in use, changes in the
symlinked crontabs are not automatically noticed by the cron
daemon. The cron daemon must receive a SIGHUP signal to
reload the crontabs. This is a limitation of the inotify
API.

The syslog
output will be used instead of mail, when sendmail is not
installed.
