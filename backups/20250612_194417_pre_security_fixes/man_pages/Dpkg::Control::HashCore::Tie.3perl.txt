NAME
       Dpkg::Control::HashCore::Tie - ties a Dpkg::Control::Hash object

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides a class that is used to tie a hash.  It implements
       hash-like functions by normalizing the name of fields received in keys
       (using Dpkg::Control::Fields::field_capitalize).  It also stores the
       order in which fields have been added in order to be able to dump them
       in the same order.  But the order information is stored in a parent
       object of type Dpkg::Control.

       Note: This is a private module, its API can change at any time.

FUNCTIONS
       Dpkg::Control::Hash->new($parent)
           Return a reference to a tied hash implementing storage of simple
           "field: value" mapping as used in many Debian-specific files.

CHANGES
