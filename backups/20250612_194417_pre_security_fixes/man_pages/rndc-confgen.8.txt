NAME

rndc-confgen -
rndc key generation tool

SYNOPSIS

rndc-confgen
[-a] [-A algorithm] [-b keysize]
[-c keyfile] [-h] [-k keyname]
[-p port] [-s address] [-t chrootdir]
[-u user]

DESCRIPTION

rndc-confgen
generates configuration files for rndc. It can be
used as a convenient alternative to writing the
rndc.conf file and the corresponding controls
and key statements in named.conf by hand.
Alternatively, it can be run with the -a option to
set up a rndc.key file and avoid the need for a
rndc.conf file and a controls statement
altogether.

OPTIONS

-a

This option sets automatic
rndc configuration, which creates a file
/etc/bind/rndc.key that is read by both rndc
and named on startup. The rndc.key file
defines a default command channel and authentication key
allowing rndc to communicate with named on the
local host with no further configuration.

If a more
elaborate configuration than that generated by
rndc-confgen -a is required, for example if rndc is
to be used remotely, run rndc-confgen without the
-a option and set up - rndc.conf and
named.conf as directed.

-A algorithm

This option specifies the
algorithm to use for the TSIG key. Available choices are:
hmac-md5, hmac-sha1, hmac-sha224, hmac-sha256, hmac-sha384,
and hmac-sha512. The default is hmac-sha256.

-b keysize

This option specifies the size
of the authentication key in bits. The size must be between
1 and 512 bits; the default is the hash size.

-c keyfile

This option is used with the
-a option to specify an alternate location for
rndc.key.

-h

This option prints a short summary of the options and
arguments to rndc-confgen.

-k keyname

This option specifies the key
name of the rndc authentication key. This must be a
valid domain name. The default is rndc-key.

-p port

This option specifies the
command channel port where named listens for
connections from rndc. The default is 953.

-q

This option prevets printing the written path in
automatic configuration mode.

-s address

This option specifies the IP
address where named listens for command-channel
connections from rndc. The default is the loopback
address 127.0.0.1.

-t chrootdir

This option is used with the
-a option to specify a directory where named
runs chrooted. An additional copy of the rndc.key is
written relative to this directory, so that it is found by
the chrooted named.

-u user

This option is used with the
-a option to set the owner of the generated
rndc.key file. If -t is also specified, only
the file in the chroot area has its owner changed.

EXAMPLES

To allow
rndc to be used with no manual configuration,
run:

rndc-confgen
-a

To print a
sample rndc.conf file and the corresponding
controls and key statements to be manually
inserted into named.conf, run:

rndc-confgen
