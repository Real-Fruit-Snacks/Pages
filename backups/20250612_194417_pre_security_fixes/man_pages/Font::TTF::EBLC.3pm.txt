       calculated from EBDT, when it is 'update'-ed.

       bitmapSizeTable
           An array of tables of following information

           indexSubTableArrayOffset (R)
           indexTablesSize (R)
           numberOfIndexSubTables (R)
           colorRef
           hori
           vert
           startGlyphIndex (R)
           endGlyphIndex (R)
           ppemX
           ppemY
           bitDepth
           flags
       indexSubTableArray (R)
           An array which contains range information.

       indexSubTable (R)
           An array which contains offsets of EBDT table.

   $t->read
       Reads the location information of embedded bitmap from the TTF file
       into memory

   $t->out($fh)
