NAME

fsp_prof
− file for fsp remote login data

DESCRIPTION

The
.fsp_prof file contains data for logging in to a
remote host over the network for file transfers by
fsp commands. This file resides in the user’s
current or home directory on the machine initiating the file
transfer. A system wide default file will be also used. If
passwords are stored in this file, its permissions should be
set to disallow read access by group and others (see
chmod(1)).

The following
tokens are recognized; they may be separated by
SPACE or NEWLINE characters
(except the host command which has to be on a line of
its own): 
host|machine name | internet-addr [
alias ...]

Identify a remote machine name.
The auto-login process searches the .fsp_prof file
for a token that matches the alias or hostname given. Once a
match is made, the subsequent .fsp_prof tokens are
processed, stopping when the EOF is reached
or another host token is encountered.
