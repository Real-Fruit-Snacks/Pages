NAME

hugetlbfs_unlinked_fd,
hugetlbfs_unlinked_fd_for_size - Obtain a file descriptor
for a new unlinked file in hugetlbfs

SYNOPSIS

#include

int
hugetlbfs_unlinked_fd(void); 
int hugetlbfs_unlinked_fd_for_size(long page_size);

DESCRIPTION

These functions
return an open file descriptor for a unique, newly-created
file in a hugetlbfs filesystem. To avoid leaking hugepages,
the file is unlinked automatically before the function
returns.

For
hugetlbfs_unlinked_fd, the default huge page size is used
(see gethugepagesize(3)). For
hugetlbfs_unlinked_fd_for_size, a valid huge page size must
be specified (see gethugepagesizes(3)).

RETURN VALUE

On success, a
valid open file descriptor is returned. On failure, -1 is
returned and errno may be set appropriately.
