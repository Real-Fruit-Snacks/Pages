NAME

distrib.pats -
default values for Usenet Distribution header

DESCRIPTION

The file
/etc/news/distrib.pats is used to determine the
default value of the Distribution header. It consists of a
series of lines; blank lines and lines beginning with a
number sign (’’#’’) are ignored. All
other lines consist of three fields separated by a
colon:

weight:pattern:value

The first field
is the weight to assign to this match. If a newsgroup
matches multiple lines, the line with the heighest weight is
used. This should be an arbitrary number greater than zero.
Unlike other INN files, the order of lines in this file is
not important.

The second
field is the name of the newsgroup or a
wildmat(3)-style pattern to specify a set of
newsgroups. Multiple patterns are not allowed.

The third field
is the value that should be used if this line is picked as
the best match. It can be an empty string.

Programs such
as inews(1) that process a user’s posting
should consult this file, typically by using the
DDxxx routines, documented in libinn(3). The
intent is that all newsgroups to which an article is posted
be used to index into this file, and the value with the
highest weight should be used as the value of the
Distribution header, if none was specified.
