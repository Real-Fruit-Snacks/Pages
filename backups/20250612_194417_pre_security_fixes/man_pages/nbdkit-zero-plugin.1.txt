DESCRIPTION

"nbdkit-zero-plugin"
is a zero length plugin for nbdkit(1). It presents a
virtual device of size 0. This plugin is used to test corner
cases in nbdkit, the NBD protocol and NBD clients.

If you want a
read-only plugin with non-zero size containing zero bytes,
use nbdkit-null-plugin(1). For a writable plugin that
starts off initialized to zeroes (a RAM disk), use
nbdkit-memory-plugin(1).
