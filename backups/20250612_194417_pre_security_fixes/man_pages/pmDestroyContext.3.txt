NAME

pmDestroyContext
- destroy a PMAPI context

C SYNOPSIS

#include

int
pmDestroyContext(int handle);

cc ...
-lpcp

DESCRIPTION

An application
using the Performance Metrics Application Programming
Interface (PMAPI) may manipulate several concurrent
contexts, each associated with a source of performance
metrics, e.g. pmcd(1) on some host, or an archive of
performance metrics as created by pmlogger(1).

pmDestroyContext
destroys the PMAPI context identified by handle.
Typically this would imply some termination of a connection
to a PMCD or closing an archive file, and orderly
clean-up.

The context
must have been previously created using
pmNewContext(3) or pmDupContext(3).

On success,
pmDestroyContext returns zero. If handle was
the current PMAPI context, then the current context becomes
undefined. This means the application must explicitly
re-establish a valid PMAPI context with
pmUseContext(3), or create a new context with
pmNewContext(3) or pmDupContext(3), before the
next PMAPI operation that requires a PMAPI context.

DIAGNOSTICS

PM_ERR_NOCONTEXT

handle
does not identify a valid PMAPI context
