NAME

nbd_set_handshake_flags
- control use of handshake flags

SYNOPSIS

#include

int nbd_set_handshake_flags ( 
struct nbd_handle *h, uint32_t flags 
);

DESCRIPTION

By default,
libnbd tries to negotiate all possible handshake flags that
are also supported by the server, since omitting a handshake
flag can prevent the use of other functionality such as TLS
encryption or structured replies. However, for integration
testing, it can be useful to reduce the set of flags
supported by the client to test that a particular server can
handle various clients that were compliant to older versions
of the NBD specification.

The
"flags" argument is a bitmask, including zero or
more of the following handshake flags: 
"LIBNBD_HANDSHAKE_FLAG_FIXED_NEWSTYLE" = 1

The server gracefully handles
unknown option requests from the client, rather than
disconnecting. Without this flag, a client cannot safely
request to use extensions such as TLS encryption or
structured replies, as the request may cause an older server
to drop the connection.

"LIBNBD_HANDSHAKE_FLAG_NO_ZEROES"
= 2

If the client is forced to use
"NBD_OPT_EXPORT_NAME" instead of the preferred
"NBD_OPT_GO", this flag allows the server to send
fewer all-zero padding bytes over the connection.

For
convenience, the constant
"LIBNBD_HANDSHAKE_FLAG_MASK" is available to
describe all flags supported by this build of libnbd. Future
NBD extensions may add further flags, which in turn may be
enabled by default in newer libnbd. As such, when attempting
to disable only one specific bit, it is wiser to first call
nbd_get_handshake_flags(3) and modify that value,
rather than blindly setting a constant value.

RETURN VALUE

If the call is
successful the function returns 0.

ERRORS

On error -1 is
returned.

Refer to
"ERROR HANDLING" in libnbd(3) for how to
get further details of the error.

The following
parameters must not be NULL: "h". For more
information see "Non-NULL parameters" in
libnbd(3).

HANDLE STATE

nbd_set_handshake_flags
can be called when the handle is in the following state:

┌─────────────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────┐

│ Handle created, before connecting │ ✅
allowed │ 
│ Connecting │ ❌ error │ 
│ Connecting & handshaking (opt_mode) │
❌ error │ 
│ Connected to the server │ ❌ error
│ 
│ Connection shut down │ ❌ error │

│ Handle dead │ ❌ error │ 

└─────────────────────────────────────┴─────────────────────────┘

VERSION

This function
first appeared in libnbd 1.2.

If you need to
test if this function is available at compile time check if
the following macro is defined:

#define
LIBNBD_HAVE_NBD_SET_HANDSHAKE_FLAGS 1
