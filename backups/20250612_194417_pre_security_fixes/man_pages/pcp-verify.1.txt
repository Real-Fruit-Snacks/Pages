NAME

pcp-verify
- verify aspects of a PCP installation

SYNOPSIS

pcp verify
[-a archive] [-h host]
[-csvV?]

DESCRIPTION

pcp-verify
inspects various aspects of a PCP collector installation and
reports on whether it is configured correctly for certain
modes of operation.

By default,
pcp-verify checks that PMCD is running and no agents
are in a failed state. These checks can be extended and
refined using the command line options.

OPTIONS

The available
command line options are: 
-a archive, --archive=archive

Use the archive for
verification.

-c,
--containers

Verify the collector
installation for monitoring containers.

-h host,
--host=host

Connect to the PMCD on
host for verification.

-s, --secure

Verify that the required
components for encrypted communication are in place.

-v, --verbose

Increase the verbosity, and
report on each check as it is made. In the absence of any
issues found, pcp-verify operates silently.

-V, --version

Display version number and
exit.

-?, --help

Display usage message and
exit.

DIAGNOSTICS

pcp-verify
will exit with a non-zero status if it finds anything worth
reporting, otherwise it is silent and returns zero.

PCP ENVIRONMENT

Environment
variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On
each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains
the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).

For environment
variables affecting PCP tools, see
pmGetOptions(3).
