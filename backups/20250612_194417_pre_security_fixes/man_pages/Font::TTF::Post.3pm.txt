NAME
       Font::TTF::Post - Holds the Postscript names for each glyph

DESCRIPTION
       Holds the postscript names for glyphs. Note that they are not held as
       an array, but as indexes into two lists. The first list is the standard
       Postscript name list defined by the TrueType standard. The second comes
       from the font directly.

       Looking up a glyph from a Postscript name or a name from a glyph number
       is achieved through methods rather than variable lookup.

       This class handles PostScript table types of 1, 2, 2.5 & 3, but not
       version 4.  Support for version 2.5 is as per Apple spec rather than
       MS.

       The way to look up Postscript names or glyphs is:

           $pname = $f->{'post'}{'VAL'}[$gnum];
           $gnum = $f->{'post'}{'STRINGS'}{$pname};

INSTANCE VARIABLES
       Due to different systems having different limitations, there are
       various class variables available to control what post table types can
       be written.

       $Font::TTF::Post::no25
           If set tells Font::TTF::Post::out to use table type 2 instead of
           2.5 in case apps cannot handle version 2.5.

       VAL Contains an array indexed by glyph number of Postscript names. This
           is used when writing out a font.

       STRINGS
           An associative array of Postscript names mapping to the highest
           glyph with that name. These may not be in sync with VAL.

       In addition there are the standard introductory variables defined in
       the standard:

           FormatType
           italicAngle
           underlinePosition
           underlineThickness
           isFixedPitch
           minMemType42
           maxMemType42
           minMemType1
           maxMemType1

METHODS
   $t->read
       Reads the Postscript table into memory from disk

   $t->out($fh)
       Writes out a new Postscript name table from memory or copies from disk

   $t->XML_element($context, $depth, $key, $val)
       Outputs the names as one block of XML

   $t->minsize()
       Returns the minimum size this table can be. If it is smaller than this,
       then the table must be bad and should be deleted or whatever.

BUGS
       o   No support for type 4 tables
