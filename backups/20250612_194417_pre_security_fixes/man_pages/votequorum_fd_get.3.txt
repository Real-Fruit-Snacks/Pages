NAME

votequorum_fd_get
- Dispatches callbacks from the votequorum service

SYNOPSIS

#include

int
votequorum_fd_get(votequorum_handle_t handle,
int *fd);

DESCRIPTION

The
votequorum_fd_get function is used to retrieve the
file descriptor that may be used with the poll system call
to determine when votequorum_dispatch(3) wonâ€™t
block. The handle argument may not be used directly
with poll because it is not the file descriptor, but
instead an internal identifier used by the votequorum
library.

RETURN VALUE

This call
returns the CS_OK value if successful, otherwise an error is
returned.
