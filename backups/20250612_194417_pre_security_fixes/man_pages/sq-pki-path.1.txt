NAME

sq pki path -
Verify the specified path

SYNOPSIS

sq pki
path [OPTIONS] FINGERPRINT|KEYID
USERID

DESCRIPTION

Verify the
specified path.

A path is a
sequence of certificates starting at the root, and a User
ID. This function checks that each path segment has a valid
certification, which also satisfies any constraints (trust
amount, trust depth, regular expressions).

If a valid path
is not found, then this subcommand also lints the path. In
particular, it report if any certifications are
insufficient, e.g., not enough trust depth, or invalid,
e.g., because they use SHA-1, but the use of SHA-1 has been
disabled.

OPTIONS

Subcommand
options 
-a, --amount=AMOUNT

The required amount of
trust.

120 indicates
full authentication; values less than 120 indicate partial
authentication. When ’--certification-network’
is passed, this defaults to 1200, i.e., ’sq pki’
tries to find 10 paths.

--certification-network

Treats the network as a
certification network.

Normally,
’sq pki’ treats the Web of Trust network as an
authentication network where a certification only means that
the binding is correct, not that the target should be
treated as a trusted introducer. In a certification network,
the targets of certifications are treated as trusted
introducers with infinite depth, and any regular expressions
are ignored. Note: The trust amount remains unchanged. This
is how most so-called PGP path-finding algorithms work.

--gossip

Treats all certificates as
unreliable trust roots.

This option is
useful for figuring out what others think about a
certificate (i.e., gossip or hearsay). In other words, this
finds arbitrary paths to a particular certificate.

Gossip is
useful in helping to identify alternative ways to
authenticate a certificate. For instance, imagine Ed wants
to authenticate Laura’s certificate, but asking her
directly is inconvenient. Ed discovers that Micah has
certified Laura’s certificate, but Ed hasn’t yet
authenticated Micah’s certificate. If Ed is willing to
rely on Micah as a trusted introducer, and authenticating
Micah’s certificate is easier than authenticating
Laura’s certificate, then Ed has learned about an
easier way to authenticate Laura’s certificate.

FINGERPRINT|KEYID
USERID

A path consists of one or more
certificates (designated by their fingerprint or Key ID) and
ending in the User ID that is being authenticated

Global
options 
See sq(1) for a description of the global
options.

EXAMPLES

Verify that
Alice ceritified a particular User ID for Bob’s
certificate.
