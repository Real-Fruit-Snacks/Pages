NAME

mode2 -
Show kernel output available for LIRC drivers

SYNOPSIS

mode2
--driver driver> [--device
device>] [other options]

mode2
--raw --device device> [other
options]

mode2
--driver driver> --list-devices

DESCRIPTION

The original
purpose of this program has been to check operation of
home-brew LIRC receiver hardware and to see the IR waveform
of the remote controller without an expensive oscilloscope.
Over time, mode2 has evolved to a generic tool to
check what kind of output the kernel makes available for
lirc.

mode2 will
simply print pulse and space lengths to stdout for drivers
supporting LIRC_MODE_MODE2. For drivers supporting
LIRC_MODE_LIRCCODE such as TV-cards and the irman driver
writes the decoded, integer values.

From version
0.9.4, mode2 can also list the devices available for
a given driver. This requires enumeration support which is
available in most but not all drivers.

When given the
correct driver mode2 should always work. Without a driver,
the --raw option should always work for /dev/lirc* devices.
At the time of writing, usb devices also works in most
cases. However, since it is tricky to get the path to the
usb device, such ones are normally best accessed using a
driver.

Not all drivers
requires a device.

OPTIONS

-d
--device=device

Read from given device.

-H
--driver=driver

Use given driver.

-m --mode

Write pulse/space data as raw
config files. Does not affect LIRCCODE drivers.

-s
--scope=time

Enable ’scope like
display with time us per char. Does not affect lirccode
drivers.

-k --keep-root

Don’t drop root
privileges after opening device. See RUNNING AS ROOT.

-l --list-devices

List all available devices for
given driver. Requires support not present in all
drivers.

-g --gap=time

Treat spaces longer than time
as the gap. Time is in microseconds.

-r --raw

Access device directly. This is
primarely intended to be used with kernel rc drivers i .e.,
when accessing /dev/lirc* devices. Using other
devices might work, but is in general undefined.

-A
--driver-options=key:value[|key:value...]

Set driver-specific option
named key to given value.

-U
--plugindir=directory

Load drivers from directory.
See DRIVER LOADING.

-O, --options-file
path>

File containing default values
for all options. A relative path is interpreted from current
directory. See [FILES] below.

-D
--loglevel=level

Determine the amount of logging
information. [level] can be a symbolic syslog level:
’error’,’warning, ’info’,
’notice’ or ’debug’. lirc also
defines three additional levels ’trace’,
’trace1’ and ’trace2’ which gives
even more messages (’trace2’ bringing the most).
However, in the log these messages are marked as
’debug’. The level can also be an integer in the
range 3 (almost no messages) to 10.

-h --help

Display usage summary.

-v --version

Display version.

RUNNING AS ROOT

In many cases
mode2 needs to run as root to access devices not available
to regular users. On the other hand, running as root creates
problems such as log files owned by root, security concerns
etc.

In order to
cope with this, mode2 by default drops root privileges after
opening the input device. This support is based on that root
permissions are accquired using sudo(1) e. g., using

$ sudo mode2
--raw /dev/lirc0

If not using
sudo, the same behaviour could be accomplished using the
SUDO_USER environment variable e. g.,

#
SUDO_USER=$LOGNAME mode2 --raw /dev/lirc0

The --keep-root
option will make mode2 to keep root privileges for the
complete run.

EXAMPLES

Invoked with a
MODE2 type driver with mode2 prints space/mark
timings: 
al@snorken $ ./mode2 --driver default --device /dev/lirc0

Using driver default on device /dev/lirc0 
Trying device: /dev/lirc0 
Using device: /dev/lirc0 
pulse 2750 
space 800 
pulse 500 
space 350 
pulse 550 
space 350 
pulse 550 
...

Invoked with a
LIRCCODE type driver mode2 prints decoded values:

$ ./mode2
--driver atilibusb 
Using driver atilibusb on device /dev/lirc0 
Trying device: /dev/bus/usb/001/007 
Using device: /dev/bus/usb/001/007 
code: 0x14709b0000 
code: 0x14709b0000 
code: 0x14709b0000 
code: 0x14709b0000 
code: 0x14709b0000 
...

Invoked using
mode2 --list-devices for the devinput driver with a

single X10 RF usb device plugged in: 
$ ./mode2 --list-devices --driver devinput 
/dev/input/event12 [0bc7:0006] X10 WTI RF receiver vers:
1.10 serial: ? 
/dev/input/by-id/usb-X10_WTI_RF_receiver-event-if00 ->
../event12 
/dev/input/by-path/pci-0000:0b:00.0-usb-0:1:1.0-event ->
../event12

DRIVER LOADING

Drivers are
loaded dynamically. The search path used for this is
determined by (falling priority):

-

The --plugindir option.

-

The ’plugindir’ entry in the [lircd] section
of the lirc_options.conf file.

-

The environment variable LIRC_PLUGINDIR.

-

A hardcoded default
(/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/lirc/plugins). 

ENVIRONMENT

LIRC_LOGLEVEL

Used as fallback when there is
no --loglevel option present. Syntax is the same as for
--loglevel, see OPTIONS.

FILES

/etc/lirc/lirc_options.conf

The options file holding
default values for command line options in the [mode2]
section. For some values including debug, plugindir, driver
and device mode2 falls back to the [lircd] section if not
found in [mode2].

The location of this file can be changed using the
-O/--options-file command-line option or using the
environment variable LIRC_OPTIONS_PATH.

~/.cache/mode2.log

Debug log. Setting the
XDG_CACHE_HOME environment variable relocates this file to
$XDG_CACHE_HOME/mode2.log. The amount of logging respects
the LIRC_LOGLEVEL environment variable, defaulting to the
debug value in lirc_options.conf.
