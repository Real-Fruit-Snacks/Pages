NAME

xhfs -
graphical interface for manipulating HFS volumes

SYNOPSIS

xhfs
[left-path [right-path]]

DESCRIPTION

xhfs
presents a graphical front-end for browsing and copying
files on HFS-formatted volumes.

The display is
divided into two parts, left and right, which can each
independently view a directory on either an HFS volume or
the host (UNIX) filesystem. Double-clicking the name of a
directory in either view will open that directory. A pop-up
menu at the top of each directory view can be used to
navigate to any directory between the current and the
beginning of the hierarchy.

Text files can
be viewed by double-clicking them. Any file or set of files
can be copied to the directory shown in the other view by
selecting them and clicking the "Copy" button.
Copying is performed according to the selected copy mode:

MacBinary II

The file(s) will be copied
using the MacBinary II format. This is the recommended mode
for transferring arbitrary Macintosh files.

BinHex

The file(s) will be copied using the BinHex format. This
mode should be used to encode Macintosh files into strict
ASCII format.

Text

In this mode, only the data fork(s) of the selected
file(s) are copied. Furthermore, translation is performed on
the data’s end-of-line characters to conform to the
standard for text files on the destination.

Raw Data

In this mode, only the data
fork(s) of the selected file(s) are copied. However, no
translation is performed whatsoever on the data.

Automatic

A copy mode will be selected
automatically according to a set of heuristics.
