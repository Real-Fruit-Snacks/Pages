NAME

pngtopnm -
Convert a PNG image to PNM: replaced by pngtopam

SYNOPSIS

pngtopnm
[-verbose] [-alpha | -mix]
[-background=color]
[-gamma=value] [-text=filename]
[-time] [pngfile]

Minimum unique
abbreviation of option is acceptable. You may use double
hyphens instead of single hyphen to denote options. You may
use white space in place of the equals sign to separate an
option name from its value.

DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

pngtopnm
was obsoleted by pngtopam(1), introduced with Netpbm
10.44 (September 2008). pngtopam is backward
compatible with pngtopnm, plus adds many additional
functions, including the ability to produce a PAM image that
includes a transparency (alpha) channel.

Starting in
Release 10.48, pngtopnm is just an alias for
pngtopam.

pngtopnm
remained in the Netpbm package through Release 10.47 because
it may have fewer bugs than pngtopam in those
releases, and may be faster in some environments. But
pngtopnm’s incompatibility with the most
current PNG libraries makes it impractical to maintain along
with pngtopam now.

In releases
before 10.48, you can use the pngtopam documentation
for pngtopnm, considering the following
differences:

•

pngtopnm options are a subset of
pngtopam’s, as documented above.

•

Any change that the pngtopam manual says happened
in or after Netpbm 10.44 doesn’t apply to
pngtopnm.
