DESCRIPTION

mga is
an Xorg driver for Matrox video cards. The driver is fully
accelerated, and provides support for the following
framebuffer depths: 8, 15, 16, 24, and an 8+24 overlay mode.
All visual types are supported for depth 8, and both
TrueColor and DirectColor visuals are supported for the
other depths except 8+24 mode which supports PseudoColor,
GrayScale and TrueColor. Multi-card configurations are
supported. XVideo is supported on G200 and newer systems,
with either TexturedVideo or video overlay. The
second head of dual-head cards is supported for the G450 and
G550.

SUPPORTED HARDWARE

The mga
driver supports PCI and AGP video cards based on the
following Matrox chips. They are listed in approximate
chronological order of production (with the most recent
chipsets listed last), so consult this list when you are
unsure whether your card is meant when references are made
to ’G200 and later’ chips, for example. 
MGA2064W 
MGA1064SG

Mystique

MGA2164W

Millennium II

G100

Productiva G100

G200

Millennium G200 and Mystique G200

G400

Millennium G400, Millennium G400 MAX, Millennium G450,
and Marvel G450 eTV

G550

Millennium G550 and Millennium G550 Dual DVI

CONFIGURATION DETAILS

Please refer to
xorg.conf(5) for general configuration details. This section
only covers configuration details specific to this
driver.

The driver
auto-detects the chipset type, but the following
ChipSet names may optionally be specified in the
config file "Device" section, and will
override the auto-detection:

"mga2064w",
"mga1064sg", "mga2164w", "mga2164w
agp", "mgag100", "mgag200",
"mgag200 pci", "mgag400",
"mgag550".

The G450 is
Chipset "mgag400" with ChipRev 0x80.

The driver will
auto-detect the amount of video memory present for all chips
except the Millennium II. In the Millennium II case it
defaults to 4096 kBytes. When using a Millennium II,
the actual amount of video memory should be specified with a
VideoRam entry in the config file
"Device" section.

The following
driver Options are supported: 
Option "ColorKey"
"integer"

Set the colormap index used for
the transparency key for the depth 8 plane when operating in
8+24 overlay mode. The value must be in the range 2-255.
Default: 255.

Option "HWCursor"
"boolean"

Enable or disable the HW
cursor. Default: on.

Option "MGASDRAM"
"boolean"

Specify whether G100, G200 or
G400 cards have SDRAM. The driver attempts to auto-detect
this based on the card’s PCI subsystem ID. This option
may be used to override that auto-detection. The mga
driver is not able to auto-detect the presence of of SDRAM
on secondary heads in multihead configurations so this
option will often need to be specified in multihead
configurations. Default: auto-detected.

Option "NoAccel"
"boolean"

Disable or enable acceleration.
Default: acceleration is enabled.

Option
"AccelMethod"
"string"

Chooses between available
acceleration architectures. Valid options are XAA and
EXA. XAA is the traditional acceleration architecture
and support for it is very stable. EXA is a newer
acceleration architecture with better performance for the
Render and Composite extensions, but the rendering code for
it is newer and possibly unstable. The default is
XAA.

Option
"OverclockMem"

Set clocks to values used by
some commercial X Servers (G100, G200 and G400 only).
Default: off.

Option "PciRetry"
"boolean"

Enable or disable PCI retries.
Default: off.

Option "Rotate"
"CW" 
Option "Rotate" "CCW"

Rotate the display clockwise or
counterclockwise. This mode is unaccelerated. Default: no
rotation.

Option "ShadowFB"
"boolean"

Enable or disable use of the
shadow framebuffer layer. Default: off.

Option
"SyncOnGreen"
"boolean"

Enable or disable combining the
sync signals with the green signal. Default: off.

Option "UseFBDev"
"boolean"

Enable or disable use of on
OS-specific fb interface (and is not supported on all OSs).
See fbdevhw(4) for further information. Default: off.

Option "VideoKey"
"integer"

This sets the default pixel
value for the YUV video overlay key. Default: undefined.

Option
"TexturedVideo"
"boolean"

This has XvImage support use
the texture engine rather than the video overlay. This
option is only supported by G200 and later chips, and only
at 16 and 32 bits per pixel. Default: off.

Option
"OldDmaInit"
"boolean"

This forces the driver to use
the old DMA initialization path for DRI. Use this option
only to support a older version of the DRI driver with a
newer DRM (version 3.2 or later). This option also disables
the use of direct rendering on PCI cards. Default: off.

Option
"ForcePciDma"
"boolean"

This forces the use of PCI DMA
even if AGP DMA could be used. This option is primarily
intended for testing purposes, but it could also be used on
systems with a buggy or poorly function AGP implementation.
Default: off.
