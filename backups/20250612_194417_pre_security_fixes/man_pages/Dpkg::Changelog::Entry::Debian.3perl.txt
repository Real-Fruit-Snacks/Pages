NAME
       Dpkg::Changelog::Entry::Debian - represents a Debian changelog entry

DESCRIPTION
       This class represents a Debian changelog entry.  It implements the
       generic interface Dpkg::Changelog::Entry.  Only functions specific to
       this implementation are described below, the rest are inherited.

METHODS
       @items = $entry->get_change_items()
           Return a list of change items. Each item contains at least one
           line.  A change line starting with an asterisk denotes the start of
           a new item.  Any change line like ""[ RaphaÃ«l Hertzog ]"" is
           treated like an item of its own even if it starts a set of items
           attributed to this person (the following line necessarily starts a
           new item).

       @errors = $entry->parse_header()
       @errors = $entry->parse_trailer()
           Return a list of errors. Each item in the list is an error message
           describing the problem. If the empty list is returned, no errors
           have been found.

       $entry->normalize()
           Normalize the content. Strip whitespaces at end of lines, use a
           single empty line to separate each part.

       $src = $entry->get_source()
           Return the name of the source package associated to the changelog
           entry.

       $ver = $entry->get_version()
           Return the version associated to the changelog entry.

       @dists = $entry->get_distributions()
           Return a list of target distributions for this version.

       $ctrl = $entry->get_optional_fields()
           Return a set of optional fields exposed by the changelog entry.  It
           always returns a Dpkg::Control object (possibly empty though).

       $urgency = $entry->get_urgency()
           Return the urgency of the associated upload.

       $maint = $entry->get_maintainer()
           Return the string identifying the person who signed this changelog
           entry.

       $time = $entry->get_timestamp()
           Return the timestamp of the changelog entry.

       $time = $entry->get_timepiece()
           Return the timestamp of the changelog entry as a Time::Piece
           object.

           This function might return undef if there was no timestamp.

UTILITY FUNCTIONS
       $bool = match_header($line)
           Checks if the line matches a valid changelog header line.

       $bool = match_trailer($line)
           Checks if the line matches a valid changelog trailing line.

       @closed_bugs = find_closes($changes)
           Takes one string as argument and finds "Closes: #123456, #654321"
           statements as supported by the Debian Archive software in it.
           Returns all closed bug numbers in an array.
