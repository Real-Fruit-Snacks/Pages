NAME

rup - remote
uptime display

SYNOPSIS

rup { -u
| -v | hosts ... }

DESCRIPTION

rup
displays a summary of the current status of a particular
host or all hosts on the local network. 
The output shows how long the system has been up, the number
of users currently on the system (if the system is running
the current version of rpc.rstatd(8)), and the load
averages. 
The load average numbers give the number of jobs in the run
queue averaged over 1, 5 and 15 minutes. 
The rpc.rstatd(8) daemon must be running on the
remote host for this command to work. 
rup uses an RPC protocol defined in
/usr/include/rpcsvc/rstat.x
