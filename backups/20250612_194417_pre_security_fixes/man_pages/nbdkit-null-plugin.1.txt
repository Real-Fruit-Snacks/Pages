NAME

nbdkit-null-plugin
- nbdkit bitbucket plugin

SYNOPSIS

nbdkit null
[[size=]SIZE]

DESCRIPTION

"nbdkit-null-plugin"
is a null plugin for nbdkit(1). Everything written to
the virtual device is discarded, and reads back as
zeroes.

Most NBD
consumers will be very confused by this device. Trying to
create filesystems etc on it will likely fail badly. If the
client is caching writes locally then you will get
inconsistent read behaviour.

The null plugin
is also used when probing for installed filters, see
"Detect if a filter is installed" in
nbdkit-probing(1).

PARAMETERS

[size=]SIZE

Specify the virtual size of the
disk image.

This parameter
is optional. If omitted then a zero-sized device is
created.

"size="
is a magic config key and may be omitted in most cases. See
"Magic parameters" in nbdkit(1).

FILES

$plugindir/nbdkit-null-plugin.so

Use
"nbdkit --dump-config" to find the location of
$plugindir.

VERSION

"nbdkit-null-plugin"
first appeared in nbdkit 1.2.
