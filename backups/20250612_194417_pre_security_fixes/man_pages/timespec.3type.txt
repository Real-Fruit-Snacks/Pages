timespec(3type)                                                timespec(3type)

NAME
       timespec - time in seconds and nanoseconds

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <time.h>

       struct timespec {
           time_t     tv_sec;   /* Seconds */
           /* ... */  tv_nsec;  /* Nanoseconds [0, 999'999'999] */
       };

DESCRIPTION
       Describes times in seconds and nanoseconds.

       tv_nsec  is of an implementation-defined signed type capable of holding
       the specified range.  Under glibc, this is usually long, and long  long
       on X32.  It can be safely down-cast to any concrete 32-bit integer type
       for processing.

STANDARDS
       C11 and later; POSIX.1-2001 and later.

VERSIONS
       Prior to C23, tv_nsec was long.

NOTES
       The following headers also  provide  this  type:  <aio.h>,  <mqueue.h>,
       <sched.h>, <signal.h>, <sys/select.h>, and <sys/stat.h>.
