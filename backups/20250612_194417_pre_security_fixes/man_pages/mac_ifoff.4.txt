DESCRIPTION

The mac_ifoff interface
silencing module allows administrators to enable and disable
incoming and outgoing data flow on system network interfaces
via the sysctl(8) interface.

To disable
network traffic over the loopback (lo(4)) interface, set the
sysctl(8) OID security.mac.ifoff.lo_enabled to 0
(default 1).

To enable
network traffic over other interfaces, set the sysctl(8) OID
security.mac.ifoff.other_enabled to 1 (default
0).

To allow BPF
traffic to be received, even while other traffic is
disabled, set the sysctl(8) OID
security.mac.ifoff.bpfrecv_enabled to 1 (default
0).

BUGS

While the MAC Framework design
is intended to support the containment of the root user, not
all attack channels are currently protected by entry point
checks. As such, MAC Framework policies should not be relied
on, in isolation, to protect against a malicious privileged
user.
