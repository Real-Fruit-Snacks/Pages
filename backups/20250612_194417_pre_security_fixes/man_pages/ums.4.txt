kernel, place the following lines in your kernel
configuration file:

device uhci 
device ohci

Alternatively,
to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following line in loader.conf(5):

DESCRIPTION

The ums driver provides
support for mice that attach to the USB port. Supported are
mice with any number of buttons and mice with a wheel.

The
/dev/ums0 device presents the mouse as a
sysmouse or mousesystems type device. See
moused(8) for an explanation of these mouse types.

SYSCTL VARIABLES

The following variables are
available as both sysctl(8) variables and loader(8)
tunables:

hw.usb.ums.debug

Debug output level, where 0 is
debugging disabled and larger values increase debug message
verbosity. Default is 0.

EXAMPLES

Use the first USB mouse on the
system as your console mouse:

moused -p
/dev/ums0 -t auto

To be able to
use the USB mouse under X, change the "Pointer"
section in xorg.conf to the following:

Device

If you want to
be able to use the mouse in both virtual consoles as well as
in X change it to:
