NAME

touchwin,
touchline, untouchwin, wtouchln,
is_linetouched, is_wintouched - curses
refresh control routines

SYNOPSIS

#include

int touchwin(WINDOW *win); 
int touchline(WINDOW *win, int start, int count); 
int untouchwin(WINDOW *win); 
int wtouchln(WINDOW *win, int y, int n, int changed); 
bool is_linetouched(WINDOW *win, int line); 
bool is_wintouched(WINDOW *win);

DESCRIPTION

The
touchwin and touchline routines throw away all
optimization information about which parts of the window
have been touched, by pretending that the entire window has
been drawn on. This is sometimes necessary when using
overlapping windows, since a change to one window affects
the other window, but the records of which lines have been
changed in the other window do not reflect the change. The
routine touchline only pretends that count
lines have been changed, beginning with line
start.

The
untouchwin routine marks all lines in the window as
unchanged since the last call to wrefresh.

The
wtouchln routine makes n lines in the window,
starting at line y, look as if they have
(changed=1) or have not
(changed=0) been changed since the last call
to wrefresh.

The
is_linetouched and is_wintouched routines
return TRUE if the specified line/window was modified
since the last call to wrefresh; otherwise they
return FALSE. In addition, is_linetouched
returns ERR if line is not valid for the given
window.

RETURN VALUE

All routines
return the integer ERR upon failure and an integer
value other than ERR upon successful completion,
unless otherwise noted in the preceding routine
descriptions.

X/Open does not
define any error conditions. In this implementation

is_linetouched

returns an error if the window
pointer is null, or if the line number is outside the
window.

The constant
ERR is distinct from TRUE and FALSE,
which are the normal return values of this function. Because
the function returns a bool, returning ERR
(which is neither TRUE nor FALSE) may not be
supported by the compiler.

To provide
error-checking and also match the X/Open function prototype,
the ERR is provided by a macro named
is_linetouched. The actual function returns
FALSE when it detects an error.

wtouchln

returns an error if the window
pointer is null, or if the line number is outside the
window.

PORTABILITY

These functions
were introduced by SVr4. The Solaris curses header file, for
instance, defines both an actual function and macro for
each. The macros give the same result as the actual
functions. SVr4 curses does not check the window parameter
win to ensure that it is not NULL; otherwise
this implementation behaves the same as SVr4.

The XSI Curses
standard, Issue 4 describes these functions, but defines no
error conditions.

NOTES

All of these
routines except wtouchln may be macros.
