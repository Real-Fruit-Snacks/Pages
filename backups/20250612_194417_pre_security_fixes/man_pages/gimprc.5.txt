NAME

gimprc - gimp
configuration file

DESCRIPTION

The
gimprc file is a configuration file read by GIMP when
it starts up. There are two of these: one system-wide one
stored in /etc/gimp/2.0/gimprc and a per-user
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/GIMP/2.10/gimprc which may override
system settings.

Comments are
introduced by a hash sign (#), and continue until the end of
the line. Blank lines are ignored.

The
gimprc file associates values with properties. These
properties may be set by lisp-like assignments of the
form:

(property-name value)

where:

property-name

is one of the property names
described below.

value

is the value the property is to be set to.

Either spaces
or tabs may be used to separate the name from the value.

PROPERTIES

Valid
properties and their default values are: 
(temp-path "${gimp_temp_dir}")

Sets the folder
for temporary storage. Files will appear here during the
course of running GIMP. Most files will disappear when GIMP
exits, but some files are likely to remain, so it is best if
this folder not be one that is shared by other users. This
is a single folder.

(swap-path
"${gimp_cache_dir}")

Sets the swap
file location. GIMP uses a tile based memory allocation
scheme. The swap file is used to quickly and easily swap
tiles out to disk and back in. Be aware that the swap file
can easily get very large if GIMP is used with large images.
Also, things can get horribly slow if the swap file is
created on a folder that is mounted over NFS. For these
reasons, it may be desirable to put your swap file in
"/tmp". This is a single folder.

(swap-compression
"fast")

The compression
method used for tile data stored in the swap file. This is a
string value.

(num-processors 1)

Sets how many
threads GIMP should use for operations that support it. This
is an integer value.

(tile-cache-size 2g)

When the amount
of pixel data exceeds this limit, GIMP will start to swap
tiles to disk. This is a lot slower but it makes it possible
to work on images that wouldn’t fit into memory
otherwise. If you have a lot of RAM, you may want to set
this to a higher value. The integer size can contain a
suffix of ’B’, ’K’, ’M’
or ’G’ which makes GIMP interpret the size as
being specified in bytes, kilobytes, megabytes or gigabytes.
If no suffix is specified the size defaults to being
specified in kilobytes.

(use-opencl no)

When enabled,
uses OpenCL for some operations. Possible values are yes and
no.

Specifies the
language to use for the user interface. This is a string

value. 
(interpolation-type cubic)

Sets the level
of interpolation used for scaling and other transformations.
Possible values are none, linear, cubic, nohalo and
lohalo.

(default-threshold 15)

Tools such as
fuzzy-select and bucket fill find regions based on a
seed-fill algorithm. The seed fill starts at the initially
selected pixel and progresses in all directions until the
difference of pixel intensity from the original is greater
than a specified threshold. This value represents the
default threshold. This is an integer value.

PATH EXPANSION

Strings of type
PATH are expanded in a manner similar to bash(1).
Specifically: tilde (~) is expanded to the user’s home
directory. Note that the bash feature of being able to refer
to other user’s home directories by writing ~userid/
is not valid in this file.

${variable} is
expanded to the current value of an environment variable.
There are a few variables that are pre-defined: 
gimp_dir

The personal gimp directory
which is set to the value of the environment variable
GIMP2_DIRECTORY or to $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/GIMP/2.10.

gimp_data_dir

Base for paths to shareable
data, which is set to the value of the environment variable
GIMP2_DATADIR or to the compiled-in default value
${datarootdir}/gimp/2.0.

gimp_plug_in_dir

Base to paths for
architecture-specific plug-ins and modules, which is set to
the value of the environment variable GIMP2_PLUGINDIR or to
the compiled-in default value /usr/lib/gimp/2.0.

gimp_sysconf_dir

Path to configuration files,
which is set to the value of the environment variable
GIMP2_SYSCONFDIR or to the compiled-in default value
/etc/gimp/2.0.

gimp_cache_dir

Path to cached files, which is
set to the value of the environment variable GIMP2_CACHEDIR
or to the system default for per-user cached files.

gimp_temp_dir

Path to temporary files, which
is set to the value of the environment variable
GIMP2_TEMPDIR or to the system default for temporary
files.
