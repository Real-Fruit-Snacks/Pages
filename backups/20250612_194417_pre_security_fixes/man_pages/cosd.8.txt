NAME

cosd −
ceph object storage daemon

SYNOPSIS

cosd
−i osdnum [
−−osd−data datapath ] [
−−osd−journal journal ] [
−−mkfs ]

DESCRIPTION

cosd is
the object storage daemon for the Ceph distributed file
system. It is responsible for storing objects on a local
file system and providing access to them over the
network.

The
datapath argument should be a directory on a btrfs
file system where the object data resides. The
journal is optional, and is only useful
performance-wise when it resides on a different disk than
datapath with low latency (ideally, an NVRAM
device).

OPTIONS

−D

Debug mode: do not daemonize
after startup (run in foreground) and send log output to
stdout. 

−f

do not daemonize after startup (run in foreground), but
log to the usual location. Useful when run via
crun(8). 

−−osd−data
osddata

Use object store at
osddata.

−−osd−journal
journal

Journal updates to
journal.

−−mkfs

Create an empty object repository. Normally invoked by
mkcephfs(8). 

−c
ceph.conf,
−−conf=ceph.conf

Use ceph.conf
configuration file instead of the default
/etc/ceph/ceph.conf for runtime configuration
options.

−m
monaddress[:port]

Connect to specified monitor
(instead of looking through ceph.conf).
