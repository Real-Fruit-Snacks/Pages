NAME

nbd_set_debug_callback
- set the debug callback

SYNOPSIS

#include

typedef struct { 
int (*callback) (void *user_data, const char *context, 
const char *msg); 
void *user_data; 
void (*free) (void *user_data); 
} nbd_debug_callback; 
int nbd_set_debug_callback ( 
struct nbd_handle *h, 
nbd_debug_callback debug_callback 
);

DESCRIPTION

Set the debug
callback. This function is called when the library emits
debug messages, when debugging is enabled on a handle. The
callback parameters are "user_data" passed to this
function, the name of the libnbd function emitting the debug
message ("context"), and the message itself
("msg"). If no debug callback is set on a handle
then messages are printed on "stderr".

The callback
should not call "nbd_*" APIs on the same handle
since it can be called while holding the handle lock and
will cause a deadlock.

RETURN VALUE

If the call is
successful the function returns 0.

ERRORS

On error -1 is
returned.

Refer to
"ERROR HANDLING" in libnbd(3) for how to
get further details of the error.

The following
parameters must not be NULL: "h". For more
information see "Non-NULL parameters" in
libnbd(3).

VERSION

This function
first appeared in libnbd 1.0.

If you need to
test if this function is available at compile time check if
the following macro is defined:

#define
LIBNBD_HAVE_NBD_SET_DEBUG_CALLBACK 1
