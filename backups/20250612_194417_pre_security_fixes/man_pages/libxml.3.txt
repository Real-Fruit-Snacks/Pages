NAME

libxml -
library used to parse XML files

DESCRIPTION

The
libxml library is used to parse XML files. Its
internal document representation is as close as possible to
the DOM (Document Object Model) interface, an API for
accessing XML or HTML structured documents.

The
libxml library also has a SAX-like interface,
which is designed to be compatible with expat(1).
NOTE: SAX, the Simple API for XML, is a standard
interface for event-based XML parsing, developed
collaboratively by the members of the XML-DEV mailing list,
currently hosted by OASIS. The expat library is a XML
1.0 parser written in C, which aims to be fully conforming.
It is currently not a validating XML processor.

The
libxml library now includes a nearly complete
XPath implementation. The XPath (XML Path
Language) is a language for addressing parts of an XML
document, designed to be used by both XSLT and
XPointer.

The
libxml library exports Push and Pull type parser
interfaces for both XML and html.
