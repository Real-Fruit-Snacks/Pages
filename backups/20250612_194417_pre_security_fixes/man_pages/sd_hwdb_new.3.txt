NAME

sd_hwdb_new,
sd_hwdb_new_from_path, sd_hwdb_ref, sd_hwdb_unref - Create a
new hwdb object and create or destroy references to it

SYNOPSIS

#include

int
sd_hwdb_new(sd_hwdb **hwdb); 

int
sd_hwdb_new_from_path(const char *path,
sd_hwdb **hwdb); 

sd_hwdb*
sd_hwdb_ref(sd_hwdb *hwdb); 

sd_hwdb*
sd_hwdb_unref(sd_hwdb *hwdb); 

DESCRIPTION

sd_hwdb_new()
creates a new hwdb object to access the binary hwdb
database. Upon initialization, the file containing the
binary representation of the hardware database is located
and opened. The new object is returned in hwdb.

sd_hwdb_new_from_path()
may be used to specify the path from which the binary
hardware database should be opened.

The hwdb
object is reference counted. sd_hwdb_ref() and
sd_hwdb_unref() may be used to get a new reference or
destroy an existing reference to an object. The caller must
dispose of the reference acquired with sd_hwdb_new()
by calling sd_hwdb_unref() when done with the
object.

Use
sd_hwdb_seek(3), sd_hwdb_get(3), and
sd_hwdb_enumerate(3) to access entries.

RETURN VALUE

On success,
sd_hwdb_new() and sd_hwdb_new_from_path()
return a non-negative integer. On failure, a negative
errno-style error code is returned.

sd_hwdb_ref()
always returns the argument.

sd_hwdb_unref()
always returns NULL.

Errors

Returned errors may indicate the following problems:

-ENOENT

The binary hardware database
file could not be located. See systemd-hwdb(8) for
more information.

Added in
version 246.

-EINVAL

The located binary hardware
database file is in an incompatible format.

Added in
version 246.

-ENOMEM

Memory allocation failed.

Added in
version 246.

NOTES

Functions
described here are available as a shared library, which can
be compiled against and linked to with the
libsystemd pkg-config(1) file.

The code
described here uses getenv(3), which is declared to
be not multi-thread-safe. This means that the code calling
the functions described here must not call setenv(3)
from a parallel thread. It is recommended to only do calls
to setenv() from an early phase of the program when
no other threads have been started.

HISTORY

sd_hwdb_new(),
sd_hwdb_ref(), and sd_hwdb_unref() were added
in version 246.

sd_hwdb_new_from_path()
was added in version 252.
