DESCRIPTION

s3virge
is an Xorg driver for S3 based video cards. The driver is
fully accelerated, and provides support for the following
framebuffer depths: 8, 15, 16, and 24. All visual types are
supported for depth 8, and TrueColor visuals are supported
for the other depths. XVideo hardware up scaling is
supported in depth 16 and 24 on the DX, GX, GX2, MX, MX+,
and Trio3D/2X. Doublescan modes are supported and tested in
depth 8 and 16 on DX, but disable XVideo. Doublescan modes
on other chipsets are untested.

SUPPORTED HARDWARE

s3virge driver supports PCI and AGP video cards based
on the following S3 chips:

ViRGE DX

86C375

ViRGE GX

86C385

ViRGE GX2

86C357

ViRGE MX

86C260

ViRGE MX+

86C280

Trio 3D

86C365

Trio 3D/2X

86C362, 86C368

CONFIGURATION DETAILS

Please refer to
xorg.conf(5) for general configuration details. This section
only covers configuration details specific to this driver.
All options names are case and white space insensitive when
parsed by the server, for example, "virge vx" and
"VIRGEvx" are equivalent.

The driver
auto-detects the chipset type, but the following
ChipSet names may optionally be specified in the
config file ""Device"" section,
and will override the auto-detection:

"virge",
"86c325", "virge vx",
"86c988", "virge dx",
"86c375", "virge gx",
"86c385", "virge gx2",
"86c357", "virge mx",
"86c260", "virge mx+",
"86c280", "trio 3d", "86c365",
"trio 3d/2x", "86c362",
"86c368".

The following
Cursor Options are supported: 
Option "HWCursor"
["boolean"]

Enable or disable the HW
cursor. Default: on.

Option "SWCursor"
["boolean"]

Inverse of
"HWCursor". Default: off.

The following
display Options are supported: 
Option "ShadowFB"
["boolean"]

Use shadow framebuffer.
Disables HW acceleration. Default: off.

Option "Rotate"
"cw | ccw"

Rotate the screen CW -
clockwise or CCW - counter clockwise. Disables HW
Acceleration and HW Cursor, uses ShadowFB. Default: no
rotation.

Option "XVideo"
["boolean"]

Disable XVideo support by using
the off option. This changes FIFO settings which prevent
screen noise for high-res modes. Default: on

The following
video memory Options are supported: 
Option "slow_edodram"

Switch the standard ViRGE to
2-cycle edo mode. Try this if you encounter pixel corruption
on the ViRGE. Using this option will cause a large decrease
in performance. Default: off.

Option
"fpm_vram"

Switch the ViRGE/VX to fast
page mode vram mode. Default: off.

Option "slow_dram |
fast_dram"

Change Trio 3D and 3D/2X memory
options. Default: Use BIOS defaults.

Option
"early_ras_precharge |
late_ras_precharge"

adjust memory parameters. One
of these will us the same settings as your video card
defaults, and using neither in the config file does the
same. Default: none.

Option "set_mclk"
"integer"

sets the memory clock, where
integer is in kHz, and integer 

Option
"set_refclk"
"integer"

sets the ref clock for ViRGE
MX, where integer is in kHz. Default: probe the
memory clock value, and use it at server start.

The following
acceleration and graphics engine Options are
supported: 
Option "NoAccel"

Disable acceleration. Very
useful for determining if the driver has problems with
drawing and acceleration routines. This is the first option
to try if your server runs but you see graphic corruption on
the screen. Using it decreases performance, as it uses
software emulation for drawing operations the video driver
can accelerate with hardware. Default: acceleration is
enabled.

Option
"UseFB"

There are two framebuffer
rendering methods. fb and cfb. Both are available in the
driver. fb is the newer and default method. To switch back
to cfb use this option with no, off or other negative
parameter. Default: on.

Option
"fifo_aggressive | fifo_moderate |
fifo_conservative"

alter the settings for the
threshold at which the pixel FIFO takes over the internal
memory bus to refill itself. The smaller this threshold, the
better the acceleration performance of the card. You may try
the fastest setting (fifo_aggressive) and move down
if you encounter pixel corruption. The optimal setting will
probably depend on dot-clock and on color depth. Note that
specifying any of these options will also alter other memory
settings which may increase performance, so trying
fifo_conservative will in most cases be a slight
benefit (this uses the chip defaults). If pixel corruption
or transient streaking is observed during drawing operations
then removing any fifo options is recommended. Default:
none.

The following
PCI bus Options are supported: 
Option "pci_burst"
["boolean"]

will enable PCI burst mode.
This should work on all but a few broken PCI chipsets, and
will increase performance. Default: off.

Option "pci_retry"
["boolean"]

will allow the driver to rely
on PCI Retry to program the ViRGE registers.
pci_burst must be enabled for this to work. This will
increase performance, especially for small fills/blits,
because the driver does not have to poll the ViRGE before
sending it commands to make sure it is ready. It should work
on most recent PCI chipsets. Default: off.

The following
ViRGE MX LCD Options are supported: 
Option "lcd_center" 
Option "set_lcdclk"
"integer"

allows setting the clock for a
ViRGE MX LCD display. integer is in Hz. Default: use
probed value.

The following
additional Options are supported: 
Option "ShowCache"
["boolean"]

Enable or disable viewing
offscreen cache memory. A development debug option. Default:
off.

Option
"mx_cr3a_fix"
["boolean"]

Enable or disable a cr3a fix
added for ViRGE MX. Default: on.

KNOWN BUGS

The VideoRam
generic driver parameter is presently ignored by the s3virge
driver. On PPC this is reported to cause problems for 2M
cards, because they may autodetect as 4M.

SUPPORT

For assistance

http://www.x.org. If you find a problem with Xorg or have a
question not answered in the FAQ please use our bug report
form available on the web site. When reporting problems with
the driver send as much detail as possible, including
chipset type, a server output log, and operating system
specifics.
