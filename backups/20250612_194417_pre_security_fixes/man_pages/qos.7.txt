NAME

qos - Quality
of Service specification

DESCRIPTION

The
text2qos and qos2text functions use the format
described in this man page. Because all standard ATM tools
on Linux use those functions to convert to or from the
textual representation of QOS specifications, they expect
them in the same format too.

The most
fundamental parameters are the traffic class and the
AAL (ATM Adaption Layer) type. If the connection is
bi-directional, both directions have the same traffic class
and the same AAL type. The traffic class and the AAL type
are the first elements (in any order) in a QOS
specification. The traffic class is the only required
element. If the AAL type is omitted, the application will
provide a default value. The following traffic classes are
recognized:

ubr

Unassigned Bit Rate

cbr

Constant Bit Rate

abr

Available Bit Rate

The following
AAL types are recognized:

aal0

("raw ATM")

aal5

If both, the traffic class and
the AAL type are specified, they are separated by a
comma.

If more
parameters are supplied, the traffic class and AAL type must
be followed by a colon. Traffic parameters can be specified
independently for the transmit and the receive direction.
Their parameter lists are prefixed with tx: and
rx:, respectively. If both parameter lists are
present, the tx: list must precede the rx:
list. If a parameter is equal for both directions, it can be
placed in a common parameter list (without prefix). The
general format is as follows:

class_and_aal:common_list,tx:list,rx:list

Each list
consists of elements specifying a parameter. Elements can
appear in any order and they are separated with commas. The
following elements are recognized: 
pcr=rate

is a synonym for
max_pcr=rate

max_pcr=rate

The upper limit for the peak
cell rate to assign. If omitted, any rate up to link speed
may be chosen.

min_pcr=rate

The lower limit for the peak
cell rate to assign. If omitted, any rate above zero can be
chosen.

sdu=size

is a synonym for
max_sdu=size

max_sdu=size

The size of the largest packet
that may be sent or received. If omitted, a
context-dependent default value is used.

Values are
specified as follows:

rate

The (decimal) rate, optionally followed by a unit. The
unit may be prefixed with one of the multipliers k,
M, or G, meaning 1’000,
1’000’000, or 1’000’000’000,
respectively. The units cps (cells per second) and
bps (bits per second) are recognized. If multiplier
and unit are omitted, cells per second are assumed. Note
that the rate is always converted to cells per second, so
rounding errors may occur when specifying the rate in bits
per second. Rates measured in bits per second are considered
to be user data rates, i.e. one cell corresponds to 384
bits. The rate can be a fractional value, e.g.
1.3Mbps. It is an error to specify only a multiplier
without a unit. Link speed can be indicated by using the
keyword max as the rate.

size

The (decimal) number of bytes.

The tx:
or rx: lists may also just contain the single element
none, which indicates that the corresponding
direction is not used. It is an error to specify none
for both direction.

Note that
commas must never follow colons or other commas. Also,
whitespace is not allowed inside a QOS specification. QOS
specifications are case-insensitive.

EXAMPLES

Each of the
following lines contains a valid QOS specification:

ubr 
ubr:pcr=100kbps 
cbr,aal0:pcr=64kbps 
CBR:max_pcr=11Mbps,min_pcr=10mbps,sdu=8192 
aal5,ubr:tx:none 
cbr:tx:pcr=30000,rx:none

The following
specificiations are equivalent:

CBR,AAL5:PCR=48Mbps

cbr,aal5:max_pcr=125000 
cbr,aal5:tx:pcr=125kcps,rx:pcr=125kcps
