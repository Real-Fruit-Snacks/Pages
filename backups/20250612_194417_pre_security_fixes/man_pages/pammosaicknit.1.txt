NAME

pammosaicknit -
validate a mosaic knitting pattern

SYNOPSIS

pammosaicknit
[in_netpbmfile]

DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

pammosaicknit
helps the user create
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slip-stitch_knitting#Mosaic_knitting">mosaic
knitting patterns . The program inputs a black-and-white
Netpbm image that describes a mosaic knitting pattern and
outputs a color Netpbm image of the same pattern but with
invalid runs shown in red.

A valid
knitting pattern starts with a "black" row on the
bottom and alternates "white" and
"black" rows. A "black" row can contain
any arrangement of black pixels but no more than three
consecutive white pixels. A "white" row can
contain any arrangement of white pixels but no more than
three consecutive black pixels. Columns wrap horizontally,
so a "white" row that both begins and ends with
two black pixels is deemed to contain four consecutive black
pixels. Because this is an invalid number for a
"white" row, those four pixels will be recolored
red in the output image.

For clarity,
there are two shades of red in the output image. Dark red
pixels indicate pixels that were black in the input image
but which must contain one or more white pixels. Light red
pixels indicate pixels that were white in the input image
but which must contain one or more black pixels.

If the output
image contains no red pixels, then the input image
represents a valid mosaic knitting pattern.

OPTIONS

There are no
command line options defined specifically for
pammosaicknit, but it recognizes the options common
to all programs based on libnetpbm (See
 Common Options
.)

ARGUMENTS

pammosaicknit’s
only argument, in_netpbmfile, is the name of an image
file that represents a mosaic knitting pattern. If you
don’t specify in_netpbmfile, the program reads
the image from Standard Input.

NOTES

If the input
image is not a black-and-white image, pammosaicknit
converts it internally to black and white by thresholding
each pixel’s luminosity. The output image is always a
color image containing at most four colors (black, white,
dark red, light red).
