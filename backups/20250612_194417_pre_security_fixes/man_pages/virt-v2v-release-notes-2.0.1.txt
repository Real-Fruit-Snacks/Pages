virt-v2v-release-notes
- virt-v2v release notes for 2.0

DESCRIPTION

These are the
release notes for virt-v2v 2.0. This describes
the major changes since 1.42.

No release
notes were published for 1.44, so that release is covered
here.

Virt-v2v 2.0.0
was released on 14 March 2022.

Security

There were no security-related bugs found in this
release.

New
features 
Virt-v2v has been modularised allowing external programs to
examine the state of the conversion and inject their own
copying step. Further enhancements will be made to this new
architecture in forthcoming releases.

The command
line is almost identical apart from some debugging features
that were removed (see below). The only significant
difference is that the output format (-of) now has to
be specified if it is different from the input format,
whereas previous versions of virt-v2v would use the same
output format as input format automatically.

A lot of time
was spent improving the performance of virt-v2v in common
cases.

Implement
conversion of ALT Linux guests (Mikhail Gordeev).

Many bug fixes
and performance enhancements were made to oVirt imageio
output (Nir Soffer).

There is a new
virt-v2v-in-place(1) tool which replaces the existing
virt-v2v --in-place option.

Virt-v2v can
now convert guests which use LUKS encrypted logical volumes
(Laszlo Ersek).

Option -oo
rhv-direct has been replaced by -oo rhv-proxy,
and direct mode (which is much faster) is now the default
when writing to oVirt, with proxy mode available for
restricted network configurations (thanks: Nir Soffer).

The following
command line options were removed: --print-estimate,
--debug-overlays, --no-copy.

Virt-v2v no
longer installs the RHEV-APT tool in Windows guests. This
tool was deprecated and then removed in oVirt 4.3.

Deprecated tool
virt-v2v-copy-to-local has been removed. This was deprecated
in November 2018.

Other
fixes 
Remove reference to prl_strg driver in Windows guests to
avoid BSOD (Denis Plotnikov).

Fix conversions
of UEFI Linux guests that don’t provide their own
fallback bootloader (Denis Plotnikov).

Remove use of
nbdkit-readahead-filter(1). This filter uses a naive
strategy and it had several negative effects on
conversions.

Remove prompts
for interactive passwords. Normally you should try to use
the -ip and/or -op options to supply
passwords.

For Windows
guests, we insert a schtasks command. However the parameters
of this command are timezone dependent and so it failed in
non-European timezones. (Thanks: Dinesh Herath,
Tomáš Golembiovský, Bryan Kinney, Mark
Zealey, Xiaodai Wang)

Virt-v2v will
reauthenticate with vCenter servers periodically when
copying guests over HTTPS which stops large guests and/or
slow copies taking longer than about 30 minutes from
failing.

Virt-v2v now
sets libguestfs SMP to match number of physical host CPUs,
which helps performance of certain conversion steps.

Virt-v2v output
to oVirt now attempts to set the machine and firmware type
correctly. Note an exact mapping is not always possible and
oVirt may ignore our recommendations (incorrectly)
sometimes.

Virt-v2v now
generates a virtio-vsock device for guests which support it
(Valeriy Vdovin).

All guests now
need at least 100 MB of free space for conversion to succeed
(Ming Xie).

Standard VGA
instead of QXL is now used as the video type for converted
guests (Laszlo Ersek).

Older guests
(eg RHEL 6) will use the virtio-transitional model after
conversion. This feature and the machine type are now
usually determined from the libosinfo database, falling back
to hard-coded values if libosinfo is not available (Laszlo
Ersek).

When virt-v2v
prints messages to a pipe or file it no longer wraps them,
making parsing simpler. You can enable wrapping in this mode
using --wrap (Laszlo Ersek).

Windows guest
firstboot scripts installed by virt-v2v now run in the right
order, making network configuration happen earlier (Laszlo
Ersek).

Build
changes 
libguestfs ≥ 1.44 is now required.

nbdcopy(1)
and OCaml NBD bindings, both from libnbd ≥ 1.10, are now
required.

nbdkit ≥
1.22 is now required (Nir Soffer).

pcre2 (instead
of pcre) is now required.

gnulib is no
longer bundled or used by virt-v2v.

OCaml ≥ 4.04
is now required. OCaml 4.13 support has been added in this
release.

OpenSSH scp
≥ 8.8 is now required. Earlier versions will fail because
the command line syntax was changed incompatibly.

Internals

Weblate instead of Zanata is now used for translations (Pino
Toscano).
