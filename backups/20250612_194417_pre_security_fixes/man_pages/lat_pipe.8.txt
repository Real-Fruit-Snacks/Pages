NAME

lat_pipe -
measure interprocess communication latency through pipes

SYNOPSIS

lat_pipe
[ -P  ] [ -W
 ] [ -N  ]

DESCRIPTION

lat_pipe
uses two processes communicating through a Unix pipe to
measure interprocess communication latencies. The benchmark
passes a token back and forth between the two processes
(this sort of benchmark is frequently referred to as a
’’hot potato’’ benchmark). No other
work is done in the processes.

OUTPUT

The reported
time is in microseconds per round trip and includes the
total time, i.e., the context switching overhead is
includeded. Output format is like so

Pipe
latency: 491 microseconds

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

Funding for the
development of this tool was provided by Sun Microsystems
Computer Corporation.
