NAME

sane-ibm - SANE
backend for IBM and Ricoh SCSI flatbed scanners

DESCRIPTION

The
sane-ibm library implements a SANE (Scanner Access
Now Easy) backend that provides access to the IBM 2456 and
the Ricoh IS-410, IS-420, and IS-430 flatbed scanners.
Support for the IS-410 and IS-430 is untested. Please
contact the maintainer or the sane-devel mailing list if you
own such a scanner.

This backend is
alpha-quality. It may have bugs and some scanners
haven’t been tested at all. Be careful and pull the
plug if the scanner causes unusual noise.

DEVICE NAMES

This backend
expects device names of the form:

special

Where
special is either the path-name for the special
device that corresponds to a SCSI scanner. The program
sane-find-scanner helps to find out the correct
device. Under Linux, such a device name could be
/dev/sg0 or /dev/sga, for example. See
sane-scsi(5) for details.

CONFIGURATION

The contents of
the ibm.conf file is a list of device names that
correspond to SCSI scanners. Empty lines and lines starting
with a hash mark (#) are ignored. See sane-scsi(5) on
details of what constitutes a valid device name.

FILES

/etc/sane.d/ibm.conf

The backend configuration file
(see also description of SANE_CONFIG_DIR below).

/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-ibm.a

The static library implementing
this backend.

/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-ibm.so

The shared library implementing
this backend (present on systems that support dynamic
loading).

ENVIRONMENT

SANE_CONFIG_DIR

This environment variable
specifies the list of directories that may contain the
configuration file. Under UNIX, the directories are
separated by a colon (’:’), under OS/2, they are
separated by a semi-colon (’;’). If this
variable is not set, the configuration file is searched in
two default directories: first, the current working
directory (".") and then in /etc/sane.d. If the
value of the environment variable ends with the directory
separator character, then the default directories are
searched after the explicitly specified directories. For
example, setting SANE_CONFIG_DIR to
"/tmp/config:" would result in directories
"tmp/config", ".", and
"/etc/sane.d" being searched (in this order).

SANE_DEBUG_IBM

If the library was compiled
with debug support enabled, this environment variable
controls the debug level for this backend. Higher debug
levels increase the verbosity of the output.
