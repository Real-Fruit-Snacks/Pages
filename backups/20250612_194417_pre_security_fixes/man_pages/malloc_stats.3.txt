NAME

malloc_stats -
print memory allocation statistics

SYNOPSIS

#include

void
malloc_stats(void);

DESCRIPTION

The
malloc_stats() function prints (on standard error)
statistics about memory allocated by malloc(3) and
related functions. For each arena (allocation area), this
function prints the total amount of memory allocated and the
total number of bytes consumed by in-use allocations. (These
two values correspond to the arena and
uordblks fields retrieved by mallinfo(3).) In
addition, the function prints the sum of these two
statistics for all arenas, and the maximum number of blocks
and bytes that were ever simultaneously allocated using
mmap(2).

ATTRIBUTES

For an
explanation of the terms used in this section, see
attributes(7).

CONFORMING TO

is a GNU extension.

NOTES

More detailed
information about memory allocations in the main arena can
be obtained using mallinfo(3).
