Dpkg::Vendor(3perl)              libdpkg-perl              Dpkg::Vendor(3perl)

NAME
       Dpkg::Vendor - get access to some vendor specific information

DESCRIPTION
       The files in $Dpkg::CONFDIR/origins/ can provide information about
       various vendors who are providing Debian packages. Currently those
       files look like this:

         Vendor: Debian
         Vendor-URL: https://www.debian.org/
         Bugs: debbugs://bugs.debian.org

       If the vendor derives from another vendor, the file should document the
       relationship by listing the base distribution in the Parent field:

         Parent: Debian

       The file should be named according to the vendor name. The usual
       convention is to name the vendor file using the vendor name in all
       lowercase, but some variation is permitted. Namely, spaces are mapped
       to dashes ('-'), and the file can have the same casing as the Vendor
       field, or it can be capitalized.

FUNCTIONS
       $dir = get_vendor_dir()
           Returns the current dpkg origins directory name, where the vendor
           files are stored.

       $fields = get_vendor_info($name)
           Returns a Dpkg::Control object with the information parsed from the
           corresponding vendor file in $Dpkg::CONFDIR/origins/. If $name is
           omitted, it will use $Dpkg::CONFDIR/origins/default which is
           supposed to be a symlink to the vendor of the currently installed
           operating system. Returns undef if there's no file for the given
           vendor.

       $name = get_vendor_file($name)
           Check if there's a file for the given vendor and returns its name.

           The vendor filename will be derived from the vendor name, by
           replacing any number of non-alphanumeric characters (that is
           [^A-Za-z0-9]) into "-", then the resulting name will be tried in
           sequence by lower-casing it, keeping it as is, lower-casing then
           capitalizing it, and capitalizing it.

           In addition, for historical and backwards compatibility, the name
           will be tried keeping it as is without non-alphanumeric characters
           remapping, then the resulting name will be tried in sequence by
           lower-casing it, keeping it as is, lower-casing then capitalizing
           it, and capitalizing it.  And finally the name will be tried by
           replacing only spaces to "-", then the resulting name will be tried
           in sequence by lower-casing it, keeping it as is, lower-casing then
           capitalizing it, and capitalizing it.

           But these backwards compatible name lookups will be removed during
           the dpkg 1.22.x release cycle.

       $name = get_current_vendor()
           Returns the name of the current vendor. If DEB_VENDOR is set, it
           uses that first, otherwise it falls back to parsing
           $Dpkg::CONFDIR/origins/default.  If that file doesn't exist, it
           returns undef.

       $object = get_vendor_object($name)
           Return the Dpkg::Vendor::* object of the corresponding vendor.  If
           $name is omitted, return the object of the current vendor.  If no
           vendor can be identified, then return the Dpkg::Vendor::Default
           object.

           The module name will be derived from the vendor name, by splitting
           parts around groups of non alphanumeric character (that is
           [^A-Za-z0-9]) separators, by either capitalizing or lower-casing
           and capitalizing each part and then joining them without the
           separators. So the expected casing is based on the one from the
           Vendor field in the origins file.

           In addition, for historical and backwards compatibility, the module
           name will also be looked up without non-alphanumeric character
           stripping, by capitalizing, lower-casing then capitalizing, as-is
           or lower-casing.  But these name lookups will be removed during the
           1.22.x release cycle.

       run_vendor_hook($hookid, @params)
           Run a hook implemented by the current vendor object.

       names with no special character stripping.
