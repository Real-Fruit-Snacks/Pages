NAME

Baobab -
A graphical tool to analyse disk usage

SYNOPSIS

baobab
[directory]

DESCRIPTION

baobab
is able to scan either specific folders or the whole
filesystem (local and remote), in order to give the user a
graphical tree representation including each directory size
or percentage in the branch. It also auto-detects in
real-time any change made to your home directory as far as
any mounted/unmounted device. A graphical treemap window is
also provided for any selected folder.
