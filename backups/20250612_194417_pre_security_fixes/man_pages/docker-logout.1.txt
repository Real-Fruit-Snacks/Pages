NAME
       podman-logout - Logout of a container registry

SYNOPSIS
       podman logout [options] registry

DESCRIPTION
       podman  logout  logs out of a specified registry server by deleting the
       cached credentials stored in the auth.json file. If the registry is not
       specified,  the  first  registry  under  [registries.search]  from reg-
       istries.conf will be used. The path of the authentication file  can  be
       overridden  by the user by setting the authfile flag.  The default path
       used is ${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/containers/auth.json. For more details about
       format  and  configurations of the auth,json file, please refer to con-
       tainers-auth.json(5) All the cached credentials can be removed by  set-
       ting the all flag.
