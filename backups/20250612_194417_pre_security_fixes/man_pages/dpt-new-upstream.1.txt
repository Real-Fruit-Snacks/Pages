NAME

dpt-new-upstream
- list packages with newer upstream versions

SYNOPSIS

dpt
new-upstream [--help|-h] [--man|-m] [--limit|-l
PACKAGES_LIST_FILE ]

DESCRIPTION

dpt
new-upstream queries UDD ’s
DMD for newer upstream version, compares the
results to the local git clones, categorizes the found
packages, and outputs tables by category. If this reminds
you of PET -- you’re not wrong to
assume that there was some inspiration taken from there.

/* 
UDD: Ultimate Debian Database 
DMD: Debian Maintainer Dashboard 
PET: Package Entropy Tracker

*/

OPTIONS

--help|-h

Show this help.

--man|-m

Show full manpage.

--limit|-l
PACKAGES_LIST_FILE

Output the intersection of the
full result set and of the set of packages found in
"PACKAGES_LIST_FILE".

"PACKAGES_LIST_FILE"
must be in YAML format used by Tails build
manifests, for example:

https://nightly.tails.boum.org/build_Tails_ISO_stable/lastSuccessful/archive/latest.build-manifest>

Known issue:
the current implementation assumes that every binary package
on this list is built from an identically named source
package.

CONFIGURATION

dpt
new-upstream uses the "DPT_PACKAGES"
environment variable.

See
dpt-config(5) for details.
