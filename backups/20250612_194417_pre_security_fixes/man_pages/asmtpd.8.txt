DESCRIPTION

asmtpd
is the central server daemon for Mail Avanger. Mail Avenger
is a highly-configurable MTA-independent SMTP
(Simple Mail Transport Protocol) server designed to let you
filter and fight SPAM before accepting
incoming mail from a client machine. Filtering spam before
accepting a message from a remote machine offers a number of
benefits. First, while mail is in the process of being sent
over the network, more information is available about the
client machine, allowing the possibility of more accurate
decisions about spam. (For example, machines infected with
viruses may be able to be detected by probing.)

Second,
filtering during mail transfer allows more options for what
to do with potential spam. For instance, one can defer the
mail--essentially asking the client to send it again
later--which legitimate mail clients will do automatically,
but "spam ’bots" typically won’t.
Moreover, it is much safer to reject spam before accepting a
message. With typical after-delivery spam checkers, the only
options are to discard spam silently (risking false
positives that completely disappear), or to notify the
sender, but if the sender is forged, this causes more
unwanted mail. By rejecting mail during an
SMTP transaction, this ensures legitimate
mail gets bounced to the sender, while most spam will simply
disappear.

Finally,
filtering during an SMTP transaction saves
resources, since spam messages need never to be spooled in
the mail queue.

There are many
ways of fighting and detecting spam. Though Mail Avenger has
a few basic mechanisms built-in, the philosophy of the
system is to let system administrators and individual users
plug in their own filtering criteria. The intent is for Mail
Avenger to do the hard part--talk the SMTP
network protocol, handle asynchronous DNS
resolution, SPF rule checking, probing of
remote SMTP servers for legitimacy,
etc.−−while users can set policy through
configuration files with simple shell commands.

The basic
approach is for users to create scripts in a directory
called $HOME/.avenger that specify policies for what
mail to accept and what to reject or defer. System-wide
fallback policies can also be specified by files in
/etc/avenger/. The program that executes these
scripts is called avenger, and is described more
fully in its own manual page.

asmtpd can be
configured to map different email addresses and domains to
different local users, in addition to a large number of
other configurable features. These are described more fully
in the asmtpd.conf(5) manual page.

asmtpd also
adds a new header field to messages,
"X−Avenger:", containing
information that may be of use to spam filters.
"X−Avenger:" contains a list of
semi-colon-separated tokens, which if present mean the
following: 
version=number

Specifies the version of Mail
Avenger that received the message.

receiver=hostname

Specifies that asmtpd was
running on hostname when it received the message.

client−ip=IP-address

client−port=port-number

These specify that the client
end of the TCP connection from which the mail
came used IP address IP-address and
port port-number.

client−dnsfail=error

Specifies that a reverse lookup
on the client’s IP address (to
determine the client’s hostname) resulted in
error.

bounce−res=code

Specifies that attempts to send
bounces to the bounce address of the sender result in
SMTP error code. (This is the same
value as the SENDER_BOUNCERES
environment variable described in the avenger(1)
manual page.)

syn−fingerprint=fingerprint

Contains a description of the
initial TCP SYN packet used by the client to
initiate the TCP connection over which the
mail was sent. See the description of
CLIENT_SYNFP in the avenger(1)
manual page for an explanation of the format.

colon-space

If present, means the client
included a space between the colon in the command "
MAIL FROM:" or " RCPT
TO:" and the subsequent "

eager-pipelining

If present, means that the
client attempted to pipeline SMTP commands
before receiving the "250 PIPELINING"
response to the SMTP
"HELO" or "EHLO"
command. This field has the same meaning as the
CLIENT_PIPELINING environment variable
in avenger(1).

post

If present, means the client
issued the invalid SMTP command
POST . See
CLIENT_POST in avenger(1).

network−hops=nhops

This is the number of network
hops from the server to the client that sent this mail (if
Mail Avenger can figure this out). See
CLIENT_NETHOPS in
avenger(1).

network−path=IP-list

Set to a space-separated list
of as many intermediary network hops as Mail Avenger can
efficiently discover on the way from the server to the
client that send the mail. See
CLIENT_NETHOPS in
avenger(1).

network−path−time=time

To save network traffic, Mail
Avenger briefly caches routes to a particular client.
network-path-time specifies the precise time at which
the information in network-path was discovered. The
time is expressed as a standard Unix time (number of seconds
since Jan 1, 1970).

RBL=domain
(IP-addrs)[, domain (IP-addrs),
...]

For the each real-time
blackhole list ( RBL ) domain specified in
asmtpd.conf (see the RBL
directive in the asmtpd.conf(5) man page), if the
client shows up in the RBL, IP-addrs
specifies what the RBL returns.

Usually, RBLs
just return 127.0.0.1 to specify that a client is present in
the blacklist. However, some services use different
IP addresses to encode some information about
why the client is listed. If an RBL returns
multiple IP addresses, asmtpd includes them
all, separated by spaces.

RBL−errors=domain
(error)[, domain
(error), ...]

Lists any RBL
domains Mail Avenger was unable to query at the time of
receipt of the message.

GETTING
STARTED 
The following is a brief description of how to get started
with asmtpd. More information is available in the
installation guide /usr/local/share/avenger/INSTALL,
as well as the asmtpd.conf(5) and avenger(1)
manual pages.

•

If you haven’t already, create a user called
avenger on your system. This is the user
ID under which system-wide avenger scripts
will run. (If you wish to use a name other than
"avenger", you can put the directive
"AvengerUser user" in the
asmtpd.conf configuration file when you create that.)

•

Create the directory /etc/avenger.

•

Create a file /etc/avenger/asmtpd.conf. Copy the
sample file in /usr/local/share/avenger/asmtpd.conf
and edit to taste.

•

Create a file /etc/avenger/domains. List each
domain for which you would like to receive mail, followed by
a colon, one per line. For example:

    my.first.domain:
    my.second.domain:

•

Fire it up! Run the command
"asmtpd" as root. You may also want to set things
up to run this command automatically on system startup.

•

Play with scripts. Read the man page for
avenger(1), create a .avenger/rcpt file in
your home directory, and maybe create a site-wide default
file /etc/avenger/default. You will also very likely
want to create a script /etc/avenger/unknown to
reject mail to unknown users. See the man page for
aliascheck(1) and the sample
/usr/local/share/avenger/unknown for an example of
how to do this.

•

Finally, you may want to try the avenger.local delivery
agent. See the avenger.local(8) man page for more
information. 

OPTIONS

Normally, when started, asmtpd runs as a daemon, sends its
output to the system log, and looks for its configuration
file in /etc/avenger/asmtpd.conf. The following
options change this behavior:

−d

Tells asmtpd to stay in the
foreground and send its diagnostic messages to standard
error, rather than to the system log.

−−verbose

Ordinarily, asmtpd will attempt
to avoid sending overly many duplicate copies of a message
to the system log file. The −−verbose
option changes this behavior, so that certain error
conditions (such as missing directories) get reported each
time they affect a piece of mail.

−f
config-file

Specifies an alternate location
for the configuration file.

In addition,
several other options are available to run asmtpd in various
test modes, for making use of or debugging features. 
−−spf [−f
config-file]

Runs in a mode where asmtpd
simply performs SPF tests on
 pairs it reads from
standard input. Can be used to validate asmtpd’s
SPF implementation against a different
implementation, or to debug SPF records
(particularly in conjunction with the
SPF_TRACE environment variable
discussed below).

−−rbl
[−f config-file]

Tests asmtpd’s
RBL (realtime black hole) list
implementation. The configuration file should contain one or
more RBL directives (see the manual
page for asmtpd.conf(5)). In this mode, asmtpd will
simply read IP addresses from its input and
output the result of RBL checks.

−−avenge
[−f config-file] recipient
[sender [IP-address]]

Tests the avenger script for
recipient, which must be a fully-qualified email
address with a domain. This simulates an SMTP
transaction in which client IP-address tries to send
mail from sender to recipient. If
recipient is not specified, it defaults to
postmaster@HostName (where Hostname is the
local hostname, as specified in asmtpd.conf). If
 is not specified, the local address
is used.

With this
option, asmtpd will log a transcript of avenger’s
requests to standard error, regardless of the actual
DebugAvenger setting. At the end, outputs the
SMTP response asmtpd would give to the
"RCPT" command.

−−synfp
[tcp-port [IP-address [interface
...]]]

Tests asmtpd’s
SYN fingerprinting implementation. Listens to
the network and for each incoming TCP
connection, prints the IP address and port of
the client, along with a fingerprint describing the
characteristics of the initial SYN packet
from the TCP connection. (For a description
of the SYN fingerprint format, see the
description of CLIENT_SYNFP in the man
page for avenger(1).)

By default,
asmtpd will print the fingerprints of any incoming
TCP connection. If tcp-port is
non-zero, however, asmtpd will only consider
SYN packets sent to that TCP
port number. If IP-address is supplied and is not
0.0.0.0, asmtpd will only took at TCP packets
for that particular IP address (useful if
your local machine has multiple IP
addresses). Finally, by default asmtpd will listen to
whatever network interfaces correspond to IP-address
(or all active non-loopback interfaces for 0.0.0.0 or
unspecified). You can alternatively specify explicitly which
network interfaces asmtpd should listen on (e.g., "eth0
eth1").

To use this
option, you must be root (or at least have permission to
open the /dev/bpf* packet filter devices on your
machine).

−−netpath
IP-address [network-hops]

asmtpd records the network path
to mail clients using a technique similar to the
traceroute utility found on many operating systems.
The −−netpath option tests asmtpd’s
implementation of this functionality. If network-hops
is positive, asmtpd will record only the first
network-hops hops on the way to IP-address. If
network-hops is negative, asmtpd will output only the
last network-hops hops on the way to
IP-address. If network-hops is zero, or is not
supplied, asmtpd will output the entire route (or as much as
it can discover, firewall permitting).

To use this
option, you must run asmtpd as root for it to use raw
sockets.

ENVIRONMENT

SPF_TRACE

When set to a positive integer,
causes asmtpd to send to standard error a trace of the
checks it is performing while processing SPF
records. If set to 1, simply records which
SPF traces are happening. Setting it to 2
provides more information, while setting it to 3 provides a
complete trace. (Setting the value to 4 or higher
additionally causes asmtpd to send the results of all
SPF-related DNS queries to its standard
output, a feature mostly useful to the implementor.)

TMPDIR

asmtpd creates temporary files
to hold incoming mail messages before injecting them into
the mail system. It usually creates a temporary subdirectory
of /var/tmp to hold these files (and cleans up the
directory on exit). If TMPDIR is set,
its value will be used in place of /var/tmp.

FILES

/etc/avenger/asmtpd.conf,
/etc/avenger/domains, /etc/avenger/aliases,
/etc/avenger/unknown, /etc/avenger/default,
$HOME/.avenger/rcpt* /usr/local/share/avenger/*

BUGS

If the packet
capture library (libpcap) header files were not available at
compile time, asmtpd will not support TCP SYN
fingerprints and the −−synfp option will
not be available. You may be able to fix this by installing
a package for your OS called pcap, libpcap,
or libpcap-devel (depending on the distribution), then
re-running ./configure and re-compiling Mail Avenger.
