NAME

ccmake - CMake
Curses Dialog Command-Line Reference

SYNOPSIS

ccmake
[] -B  [-S
] 
ccmake [] 

DESCRIPTION

The
ccmake executable is the CMake curses interface.
Project configuration settings may be specified
interactively through this GUI. Brief instructions are
provided at the bottom of the terminal when the program is
running.

CMake is a
cross-platform build system generator. Projects specify
their build process with platform-independent CMake
listfiles included in each directory of a source tree with
the name CMakeLists.txt. Users build a project by
using CMake to generate a build system for a native tool on
their platform.

OPTIONS

-S

Path to root directory of the
CMake project to build.

-B

Path to directory which CMake
will use as the root of build directory.

If the
directory doesn't already exist CMake will make it.

-C

Pre-load a script to populate
the cache.

When CMake is
first run in an empty build tree, it creates a
CMakeCache.txt file and populates it with
customizable settings for the project. This option may be
used to specify a file from which to load cache entries
before the first pass through the project's CMake listfiles.
The loaded entries take priority over the project's default
values. The given file should be a CMake script containing
set() commands that use the CACHE option, not
a cache-format file.

References to
CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR and CMAKE_BINARY_DIR within
the script evaluate to the top-level source and build
tree.

-D
:=, -D
=

Create or update a CMake
CACHE entry.

When CMake is
first run in an empty build tree, it creates a
CMakeCache.txt file and populates it with
customizable settings for the project. This option may be
used to specify a setting that takes priority over the
project's default value. The option may be repeated for as
many CACHE entries as desired.

If the
: portion is given it must be one of the
types specified by the set() command documentation
for its CACHE signature. If the :
portion is omitted the entry will be created with no type if
it does not exist with a type already. If a command in the
project sets the type to PATH or FILEPATH then
the  will be converted to an absolute
path.

This option may
also be given as a single argument:
-D:= or
-D=.

It's important
to note that the order of -C and -D arguments
is significant. They will be carried out in the order they
are listed, with the last argument taking precedence over
the previous ones. For example, if you specify
-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug, followed by a -C
argument with a file that calls:

set(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE
"Release" CACHE STRING "" FORCE)

then the
-C argument will take precedence, and
CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE will be set to Release.
However, if the -D argument comes after the -C
argument, it will be set to Debug.

If a set(...
CACHE ...) call in the -C file does not use
FORCE, and a -D argument sets the same
variable, the -D argument will take precedence
regardless of order because of the nature of non-FORCE
set(... CACHE ...) calls.

-U

Remove matching entries from
CMake CACHE.

This option may
be used to remove one or more variables from the
CMakeCache.txt file, globbing expressions using
* and ? are supported. The option may be
repeated for as many CACHE entries as desired.

Use with care,
you can make your CMakeCache.txt non-working.

-G

Specify a build system
generator.

CMake may
support multiple native build systems on certain platforms.
A generator is responsible for generating a particular build
system. Possible generator names are specified in the
cmake-generators(7) manual.

If not
specified, CMake checks the CMAKE_GENERATOR
environment variable and otherwise falls back to a builtin
default selection.

-T

Toolset specification for the
generator, if supported.

Some CMake
generators support a toolset specification to tell the
native build system how to choose a compiler. See the
CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET variable for details.

-A

Specify platform name if
supported by generator.

Some CMake
generators support a platform name to be given to the native
build system to choose a compiler or SDK. See the
CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM variable for details.

--toolchain

New in version 3.21.

Specify the
cross compiling toolchain file, equivalent to setting
CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE variable.

--install-prefix

New in version 3.21.

Specify the
installation directory, used by the
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX variable. Must be an absolute
path.

-Wno-dev

Suppress developer
warnings.

Suppress
warnings that are meant for the author of the
CMakeLists.txt files. By default this will also turn
off deprecation warnings.

-Wdev

Enable developer warnings.

Enable warnings
that are meant for the author of the CMakeLists.txt
files. By default this will also turn on deprecation
warnings.

-Wdeprecated

Enable deprecated functionality
warnings.

Enable warnings
for usage of deprecated functionality, that are meant for
the author of the CMakeLists.txt files.

-Wno-deprecated

Suppress deprecated
functionality warnings.

Suppress
warnings for usage of deprecated functionality, that are
meant for the author of the CMakeLists.txt files.

-Werror=

Treat CMake warnings as errors.
 must be one of the following:

dev

Make developer warnings errors.

Make warnings
that are meant for the author of the CMakeLists.txt
files errors. By default this will also turn on deprecated
warnings as errors.

deprecated

Make deprecated macro and
function warnings errors.

Make warnings
for usage of deprecated macros and functions, that are meant
for the author of the CMakeLists.txt files,
errors.

-Wno-error=

Do not treat CMake warnings as
errors.  must be one of the
following:

dev

Make warnings that are meant for the author of the
CMakeLists.txt files not errors. By default this will
also turn off deprecated warnings as errors.

deprecated

Make warnings for usage of
deprecated macros and functions, that are meant for the
author of the CMakeLists.txt files, not errors.
