NAME

sq network wkd
fetch - Retrieve certificates from a Web Key Directory

SYNOPSIS

sq network
wkd fetch [OPTIONS] ADDRESS

DESCRIPTION

Retrieve
certificates from a Web Key Directory.

By default, any
returned certificates are stored in the local certificate
store. This can be overridden by using
’--output’ option.

When a
certificate is retrieved from a WKD, and imported into the
local certificate store, any User IDs with the email address
that was looked up are certificated with a local
WKD-specific key. That proxy certificate is in turn
certified as a minimally trusted CA (trust amount: 1 of 120)
by the local trust root. How much the WKD proxy CA is
trusted can be tuned using ’sq pki link add’ or
’sq pki link retract’ in the usual way.
