NOTES

All functions
listed here are thread-agnostic and only a single specific
thread may operate on a given object during its entire
lifetime. It's safe to allocate multiple independent objects
and use each from a specific thread in parallel. However,
it's not safe to allocate such an object in one thread, and
operate or free it from any other, even if locking is used
to ensure these threads don't operate on it at the very same
time.

Functions
described here are available as a shared library, which can
be compiled against and linked to with the
libsystemd pkg-config(1) file.

HISTORY

sd_journal_has_runtime_files()
