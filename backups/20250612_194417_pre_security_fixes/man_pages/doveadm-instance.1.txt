NAME

doveadm-instance
- Manage the list of running Dovecot instances

SYNOPSIS

doveadm
[-Dv] [-f formatter] instance list

doveadm [-Dv] instance remove name
| base_dir

DESCRIPTION

The doveadm
instance commands are used to manage the list of Dovecot
instances running on the server. In most installations there
is only one Dovecot instance, but in some cases is may be
useful to have more (e.g. running director proxy and backend
in the same server).

Instances are
added to the list automatically when Dovecot is started.
Each instance is uniquely identified by its base_dir
setting. Instances can be named by setting
instance_name in each instance's dovecot.conf.
When an instance is named, it can be accessed easily by
giving -i instance_name command line
parameter for Dovecot binaries (e.g. doveadm).
