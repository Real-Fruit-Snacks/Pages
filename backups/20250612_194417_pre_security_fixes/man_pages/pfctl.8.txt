DESCRIPTION

The pfctl utility
communicates with the packet filter device using the ioctl
interface described in pf(4). It allows ruleset and
parameter configuration and retrieval of status information
from the packet filter.

Packet filtering
restricts the types of packets that pass through network
interfaces entering or leaving the host based on filter
rules as described in pf.conf(5). The packet filter can also
replace addresses and ports of packets. Replacing source
addresses and ports of outgoing packets is called NAT
(Network Address Translation) and is used to connect an
internal network (usually reserved address space) to an
external one (the Internet) by making all connections to
external hosts appear to come from the gateway. Replacing
destination addresses and ports of incoming packets is used
to redirect connections to different hosts and/or ports. A
combination of both translations, bidirectional NAT, is also
supported. Translation rules are described in
pf.conf(5).

When the
variable pf is set to YES in rc.conf(8), the rule file
specified with the variable pf_rules is loaded automatically
by the rc(8) scripts and the packet filter is enabled.

The packet
filter does not itself forward packets between interfaces.
Forwarding can be enabled by setting the sysctl(8) variables
net.inet.ip.forwarding and/or
net.inet6.ip6.forwarding, to 1. Set them permanently
in sysctl.conf(5).

The pfctl
utility provides several commands. The options are as
follows:

−A

Load only the
queue rules present in the rule file. Other rules and
options are ignored.

−a
anchor[:ruleset]

Apply flags −f,
−F and −s only to the rules in the
specified anchor and optional named ruleset
ruleset. In addition to the main ruleset,
pfctl can load and manipulate additional rulesets by
name. Named rulesets are attached at anchor points,
which are also referenced by name. Evaluation of
anchor rules from the main ruleset is described in
pf.conf(5). For example, to show all filter rules inside
anchor foo:

# pfctl -a foo
-s rules

Private tables
can also be put inside subrulesets, either by having table
statements in the pf.conf(5) file that is loaded in the
anchor, or by using regular table commands as in:

# pfctl -a
foo:bar -t mytable -T add 1.2.3.4 5.6.7.8

When a rule
referring to a table is loaded in an anchor, the rule will
use the private table if one is defined, and then fallback
to the table defined in the main ruleset, if there is one.
This is similar to C rules for variables. It is possible to
create distinct tables with the same name in the global
ruleset and in an anchor, but this is often bad design and a
warning will be issued in that case.

−D
macro=value

Define macro to be set
to value on the command line. Overrides the
definition of macro in the ruleset.

−d

Disable the
packet filter.

−e

Enable the
packet filter.

−F
modifier

Flush the filter parameters
specified by modifier (may be abbreviated):

−F nat

Flush the NAT
rules.

−F queue

Flush the queue
rules.

−F rules

Flush the
filter rules.

−F state

Flush the state
table (NAT and filter).

−F Sources

Flush the
source tracking table.

−F info

Flush the
filter information (statistics that are not bound to
rules).

−F Tables

Flush the
tables.

−F osfp

Flush the
passive operating system fingerprints.

−F all

Flush all of
the above.

−f file

Load the rules contained in
file. This file may contain macros, tables,
options, and normalization, queueing, translation, and
filtering rules. With the exception of macros and tables,
the statements must appear in that order.

−g

Include output
helpful for debugging.

−h

Help.

−i
interface

Restrict the operation to the
given interface.

−k host

Kill all of the state entries
originating from the specified host. A second
−k host option may be specified, which
will kill all the state entries from the first host
to the second host. For example, to kill all of the
state entries originating from host:

# pfctl -k
host

To kill all of
the state entries from host1 to host2:

# pfctl -k
host1 -k host2

−N

Load only the
NAT rules present in the rule file. Other rules and options
are ignored.

−n

Do not actually
load rules, just parse them.

−O

Load only the
options present in the rule file. Other rules and options
are ignored.

−p
device

Use the device file
device instead of the default /dev/pf.

−q

Only print
errors and warnings.

−R

Load only the
filter rules present in the rule file. Other rules and
options are ignored.

−r

Perform reverse
DNS lookups on states when displaying them.

−s
modifier

Show the filter parameters
specified by modifier (may be abbreviated):

−s nat

Show the
currently loaded NAT rules.

−s queue

Show the
currently loaded queue rules. When used together with
−v, per-queue statistics are also shown. When
used together with −v −v, pfctl
will loop and show updated queue statistics every five
seconds, including measured bandwidth and packets per
second.

−s rules

Show the
currently loaded filter rules. When used together with
−v, the per-rule statistics (number of
evaluations, packets and bytes) are also shown. Note that
the ’skip step’ optimization done automatically
by the kernel will skip evaluation of rules where possible.
Packets passed statefully are counted in the rule that
created the state (even though the rule isn’t
evaluated more than once for the entire connection).

−s Anchors

Show the
currently loaded anchors. If −a anchor
is specified as well, the named rulesets currently loaded in
the specified anchor are shown instead.

−s state

Show the
contents of the state table.

−s Sources

Show the
contents of the source tracking table.

−s info

Show filter
information (statistics and counters). When used together
with −v, source tracking statistics are also
shown.

−s labels

Show per-rule
statistics (label, evaluations, packets, bytes) of filter
rules with labels, useful for accounting.

−s timeouts

Show the
current global timeouts.

−s memory

Show the
current pool memory hard limits.

−s Tables

Show the list
of tables.

−s osfp

Show the list
of operating system fingerprints.

−s Interfaces

Show the list
of interfaces and interface drivers available to PF. When
used together with a double −v, interface
statistics are also shown. −i can be used to
select an interface or a group of interfaces.

−s all

Show all of the
above, except for the lists of interfaces and operating
system fingerprints.

−T command
[address ...]

Specify the command (may
be abbreviated) to apply to the table. Commands include:

−T kill

Kill a
table.

−T flush

Flush all
addresses of a table.

−T add

Add one or more
addresses in a table. Automatically create a nonexisting
table.

−T delete

Delete one or
more addresses from a table.

−T replace

Replace the
addresses of the table. Automatically create a nonexisting
table.

−T show

Show the
content (addresses) of a table.

−T test

Test if the
given addresses match a table.

−T zero

Clear all the
statistics of a table.

−T load

Load only the
table definitions from pf.conf(5). This is used in
conjunction with the −f flag, as in:

# pfctl -Tl -f
pf.conf

For the
add, delete, replace and test
commands, the list of addresses can be specified either
directly on the command line and/or in an unformatted text
file, using the −f flag. Comments starting with
a "#" are allowed in the text file. With these
commands, the −v flag can also be used once or
twice, in which case pfctl will print the detailed
result of the operation for each individual address,
prefixed by one of the following letters:

A

The
address/network has been added.

C

The
address/network has been changed (negated).

D

The
address/network has been deleted.

M

The address
matches (test operation only).

X

The
address/network is duplicated and therefore ignored.

Y

The
address/network cannot be added/deleted due to conflicting
"!" attribute.

Z

The
address/network has been cleared (statistics).

Each table
maintains a set of counters that can be retrieved using the
−v flag of pfctl. For example, the
following commands define a wide open firewall which will
keep track of packets going to or coming from the OpenBSD
ftp server. The following commands configure the firewall
and send 10 pings to the ftp server:

# printf
"table  { ftp.openbsd.org }\n \ 
pass out to  keep state\n" | pfctl -f- 
# ping -qc10 ftp.openbsd.org

We can now use
the table show command to output, for each address
and packet direction, the number of packets and bytes that
are being passed or blocked by rules referencing the table.
The time at which the current accounting started is also
shown with the Cleared line.

# pfctl -t test
-vTshow 
129.128.5.191 
Cleared: Thu Feb 13 18:55:18 2003 
In/Block: [ Packets: 0 Bytes: 0 ] 
In/Pass: [ Packets: 10 Bytes: 840 ] 
Out/Block: [ Packets: 0 Bytes: 0 ] 
Out/Pass: [ Packets: 10 Bytes: 840 ]

Similarly, it
is possible to view global information about the tables by
using the −v modifier twice and the show
Tables command. This will display the number of
addresses on each table, the number of rules which reference
the table, and the global packet statistics for the whole
table:

# pfctl
-vvsTables 
--a-r- test 
Addresses: 1 
Cleared: Thu Feb 13 18:55:18 2003 
References: [ Anchors: 0 Rules: 1 ] 
Evaluations: [ NoMatch: 3496 Match: 1 ] 
In/Block: [ Packets: 0 Bytes: 0 ] 
In/Pass: [ Packets: 10 Bytes: 840 ] 
In/XPass: [ Packets: 0 Bytes: 0 ] 
Out/Block: [ Packets: 0 Bytes: 0 ] 
Out/Pass: [ Packets: 10 Bytes: 840 ] 
Out/XPass: [ Packets: 0 Bytes: 0 ]

As we can see
here, only one packet − the initial ping request
− matched the table; but all packets passing as the
result of the state are correctly accounted for. Reloading
the table(s) or ruleset will not affect packet accounting in
any way. The two XPass counters are incremented
instead of the Pass counters when a
"stateful" packet is passed but doesn’t
match the table anymore. This will happen in our example if
someone flushes the table while the ping command is
running.

When used with
a single −v, pfctl will only display the
first line containing the table flags and name. The flags
are defined as follows:

c

For constant
tables, which cannot be altered outside pf.conf(5).

p

For persistent
tables, which don’t get automatically flushed when no
rules refer to them.

a

For tables
which are part of the active tableset. Tables without
this flag do not really exist, cannot contain addresses, and
are only listed if the −g flag is given.

i

For tables
which are part of the inactive tableset. This flag
can only be witnessed briefly during the loading of
pf.conf(5).

r

For tables
which are referenced (used) by rules.

h

This flag is
set when a table in the main ruleset is hidden by one or
more tables of the same name in sub-rulesets (anchors).

−t table

Specify the name of the
table.

−v

Produce more
verbose output. A second use of −v will produce
even more verbose output including ruleset warnings. See
previous section for its effect on table commands.

−x level

Set the debug level (may
be abbreviated) to one of the following:

−x none

Don’t
generate debug messages.

−x urgent

Generate debug
messages only for serious errors.

−x misc

Generate debug
messages for various errors.

−x loud

Generate debug
messages for common conditions.

−z

Clear per-rule
statistics.
