NAME
       Image::ExifTool::NikonCustom - Read and Write Nikon custom settings

SYNOPSIS
       This module is loaded automatically by Image::ExifTool when required.

DESCRIPTION
       The Nikon custom functions are very specific to the camera model (and
       sometimes even change with firmware version).  The information is
       stored as unformatted binary data in the ShotInfo record of the Nikon
       MakerNotes.  This module contains the definitions necessary for
       Image::ExifTool to decode this information.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
       Thanks to Jens Duttke and Warren Hatch for their help decoding the
       D300, D3 and Z9 custom settings.  And thanks to the customer service
       personnel at Best Buy for not bugging me while I spent lots of time
       playing with their cameras.
