NAME

pscap - a
program to see capabilities

SYNOPSIS

pscap [ -a |
-p pid ]

DESCRIPTION

pscap is
a program that prints out a report of process capabilities.
If the application has any capabilities, it will be in the
report with the exception of init. By giving the -a command
line option, init will be included, too. By giving a pid
with the -p command line option, only the process specified
with the pid is reported. If a process is not in the report,
it has dropped all capabilities. If the process has partial
capabilities, it is further examined to see if it has an
open-ended bounding set. If this is found to be true, a
’+’ symbol is added. If the process has ambient
capabilities, a ’@’ symbols is added.

The command
name in the output may be followed by an asterisk mark (*).
This mark denotes processes which run in child user
namespaces (relative to the user namespace of pscap
itself).
