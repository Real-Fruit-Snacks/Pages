NAME

ptmx, pts -
pseudoterminal master and slave

DESCRIPTION

The file
/dev/ptmx (the pseudoterminal multiplexor device) is
a character file with major number 5 and minor number 2,
usually with mode 0666 and ownership root:root. It is used
to create a pseudoterminal master and slave pair.

When a process
opens /dev/ptmx, it gets a file descriptor for a
pseudoterminal master and a pseudoterminal slave device is
created in the /dev/pts directory. Each file
descriptor obtained by opening /dev/ptmx is an
independent pseudoterminal master with its own associated
slave, whose path can be found by passing the file
descriptor to ptsname(3).

Before opening
the pseudoterminal slave, you must pass the master’s
file descriptor to grantpt(3) and
unlockpt(3).

Once both the
pseudoterminal master and slave are open, the slave provides
processes with an interface that is identical to that of a
real terminal.

Data written to
the slave is presented on the master file descriptor as
input. Data written to the master is presented to the slave
as input.

In practice,
pseudoterminals are used for implementing terminal emulators
such as xterm(1), in which data read from the
pseudoterminal master is interpreted by the application in
the same way a real terminal would interpret the data, and
for implementing remote-login programs such as
sshd(8), in which data read from the pseudoterminal
master is sent across the network to a client program that
is connected to a terminal or terminal emulator.

Pseudoterminals
can also be used to send input to programs that normally
refuse to read input from pipes (such as su(1), and
passwd(1)).

FILES

/dev/ptmx,
/dev/pts/*

NOTES

The Linux
support for the above (known as UNIX 98 pseudoterminal
naming) is done using the devpts filesystem, which
should be mounted on /dev/pts.
