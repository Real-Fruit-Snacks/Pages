GEOM(8) BSD System Manager’s Manual GEOM(8)

NAME

geom — universal
control utility for GEOM classes

SYNOPSIS

geom class
command [options]

DESCRIPTION

The geom utility is used
to control various GEOM classes. A class has to be aware of
geom(8) comunication methods, but there are also some
standard commands which can be used for existing, not
geom(8) aware classes. Here is the list of standard
commands:

help

List all
available commands for the given class.

list

Print detailed
information (within the given class) about all geoms (if no
additional arguments were specified) or the given geoms.
This command is only available if the given class exists in
the kernel.

load

Load the kernel
module that implements the given class. This command is only
available if the class does not yet exist in the kernel and
the file geom_⟨

class ⟩ .ko can be found in one of
the directories specifed in kern.module_path
sysctl.

unload

Unload the
kernel module which implements the given class. This command
is only available if the given class is loaded as a kernel
module.

Class-specific
commands are implemented as shared libraries which are
stored in /lib/geom/ directory and are loaded via
dlopen(3) function when the class name is known. When a
class-specific shared library exists, a direct utility
should also be available under the name of
gclass.

Currently
available classes which are aware of geom(8):

•

CONCAT

•

LABEL

•

MIRROR

•

NOP

•

RAID3

•

STRIPE

EXAMPLES

The following example shows how
to set up a stripe on three disks for automatic
configuration:

geom stripe
label -v -s 65536 data /dev/da0 /dev/da1 /dev/da2 
or: 
gstripe label -v -s 65536 data /dev/da0 /dev/da1
/dev/da2

Print the list
of all providers from the DISK class:

geom disk
list

Unload a kernel
module which implements the MD class:

geom md
unload

DIAGNOSTICS

Exit status is 0 on success, and
1 if the command fails.
