VIS-OPEN(1) BSD General Commands Manual VIS-OPEN(1)

NAME

vis-open —
Interactively select a file to open

SYNOPSIS

vis-open
[-p prompt] [-f] [--]
[files]

vis-open
-h

DESCRIPTION

vis-open takes a list of
filenames and directories on the command-line and displays
them in a menu for the user to select one. If the user
selects a directory (including ..), the directory contents
are displayed as a fresh menu. Once the user has selected a
filename, its absolute path is printed to standard
output.

vis-open
uses vis-menu(1) as its user-interface, so see that page for
more details.

-p prompt

Display prompt before
the list of items. This is passed straight through to
vis-menu(1).

-f

Normally, if
vis-open is provided with a single filename or
directory argument, it will automatically select it
(printing the filename to standard output, or presenting a
new menu with the contents of the directory). If -f
is provided, vis-open will always present the
arguments it’s given, even if there’s only
one.

--

If this token
is encountered before the first non-option argument, all
following arguments will be treated as menu-items, even if
they would otherwise be valid command-line options.

If encountered
after the first non-option argument, or after a previous
instance of -- it is treated as a menu-item.

files

File and directory names to be
presented to the user. If a name does not exist on the
filesystem and the user selects it, it is treated as a
file.

-h

If present,
vis-open prints a usage summary and exits, ignoring
any other flag and arguments.

EXIT STATUS

The vis-open utility
exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error
occurs.

In particular,
like vis-menu(1), vis-open prints nothing and sets
its exit status to 1 if the user refused to select a
file.

EXAMPLES

CHOICE=$(vis-open -p
"Select a file to stat") 
if [ $? -gt 0 ]; then

echo "No selection was made, or an error
occurred" 

else

stat "$CHOICE"

fi

BUGS

Because vis-open uses
ls(1) to obtain the contents of a directory, weird things
might happen if you have control-characters in your
filenames.
