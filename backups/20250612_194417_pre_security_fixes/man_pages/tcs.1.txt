NAME

tcs âˆ’
translate character sets

SYNOPSIS

tcs [
-slcv ] [ -f ics ] [ -t
ocs ] [ file ... ]

DESCRIPTION

Tcs
interprets the named file(s) (standard input default)
as a stream of characters from the ics character set
or format, converts them to runes, and then converts them
into a stream of characters from the ocs character
set or format on the standard output. The default value for
ics and ocs is utf, the
UTF encoding described in utf(6). The
-l option lists the character sets known to
tcs. Processing continues in the face of conversion
errors (the -s option prevents reporting of these
errors). The -c option forces the output to contain
only correctly converted characters; otherwise, 0x80
characters will be substituted for UTF
encoding errors and 0xFFFD characters will
substituted for unknown characters.

The -v
option generates various diagnostic and summary information
on standard error, or makes the -l output more
verbose.

Tcs

particular, it supports a variety of Russian and Japanese
encodings. Some of the supported encodings are
