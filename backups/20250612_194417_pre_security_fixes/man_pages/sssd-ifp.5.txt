NAME

sssd-ifp - SSSD
InfoPipe responder

DESCRIPTION

This manual
page describes the configuration of the InfoPipe responder
for sssd(8). For a detailed syntax reference, refer
to the “FILE FORMAT” section of the
sssd.conf(5) manual page.

The InfoPipe
responder provides a public D-Bus interface accessible over
the system bus. The interface allows the user to query
information about remote users and groups over the system
bus.

FIND BY
VALID CERTIFICATE 
The following options can be used to control how the
certificates are validated when using the
FindByValidCertificate() API:

•
ca_db

•
p11_child_timeout

•
certificate_verification

For more
details about the options see sssd.conf(5).

CONFIGURATION OPTIONS

These options
can be used to configure the InfoPipe responder.

allowed_uids
(string)

Specifies the comma-separated
list of UID values or user names that are allowed to access
the InfoPipe responder. User names are resolved to UIDs at
startup.

Default: 0
(only the root user is allowed to access the InfoPipe
responder)

Please note
that although the UID 0 is used as the default it will be
overwritten with this option. If you still want to allow the
root user to access the InfoPipe responder, which would be
the typical case, you have to add 0 to the list of allowed
UIDs as well.

user_attributes
(string)

Specifies the comma-separated
list of white or blacklisted attributes.

By default, the
InfoPipe responder only allows the default set of POSIX
attributes to be requested. This set is the same as returned
by getpwnam(3) and includes:

name

user's login name

uidNumber

user ID

gidNumber

primary group ID

gecos

user information, typically
full name

homeDirectory

home directory

loginShell

user shell

It is possible
to add another attribute to this set by using
“+attr_name” or explicitly remove an attribute
using “-attr_name”. For example, to allow
“telephoneNumber” but deny
“loginShell”, you would use the following
configuration:

user_attributes
= +telephoneNumber, -loginShell

Default: not
set. Only the default set of POSIX attributes is
allowed.

wildcard_limit
(integer)

Specifies an upper limit on the
number of entries that are downloaded during a wildcard
lookup that overrides caller-supplied limit.

Default: 0 (let
the caller set an upper limit)
