NAME

pcic — PC Card
bridge driver

SYNOPSIS

device pcic 
device pccard

DESCRIPTION

The pcic driver provides
support for older ISA and non-Yenta PCI PC Card bridges. The
pcic driver supports most ExCA devices attached to
the ISA bus or PCI devices that do not conform to the Yenta
specification.

The following
ISA devices, or true clones, are supported in the current
code.

Intel i82365SL Step A 
Intel i82365SL Step B 
Intel i82365SL Step C

Intel’s
original 16-bit PC Card controller.

Intel i82365SL-DF

Intel’s
last version of this device. 3.3V support was added.

VLSI 82C146

An older VLSI
part with some issues on some machines.

Cirrus Logic PD-6710 
Cirrus Logic PD-6720 
Cirrus Logic PD-6722

Cirrus
Logic’s pcic controller. Compatible with the i82365SL
Step C with the addition of a different 3.3V control.

Ricoh RF5C296 
Ricoh RF5C396

Ricoh’s
PC Card bridge chips. These are compatible with the i82365SL
Step C, but with yet another different 3.3V control.

Vadem 365 
Vadem 465

Compatible with
i82365SL Step C.

Vadem 468 
Vadem 469

Like the
earlier Vadem models, but with Vadem’s own,
incompatible, 3.3V control system.

IBM PCIC

IBM clone of
the original i82365SL part, with its own ID register value.
Has no 3.3V ability.

Many other
vendors made parts in this arena, but most of them were
compatible with one of the above chipsets.

The following
PCI pcmcia bridges are supported:

Cirrus Logic PD6729 
Cirrus Logic PD6730 
O2micro OZ6729 
O2micro OZ6730 
BUGS

This does not work at all at the
moment.
