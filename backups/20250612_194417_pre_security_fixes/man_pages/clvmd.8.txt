[−V]

DESCRIPTION

clvmd is the
daemon that distributes LVM metadata updates around a
cluster. It must be running on all nodes in the cluster and
will give an error if a node in the cluster does not have
this daemon running.

Also see
lvmlockd(8) for a newer method of using LVM on shared
storage.

OPTIONS

−C

Only valid if −d
is also specified. Tells all clvmds in a cluster to
enable/disable debug logging. Without this switch, only the
local clvmd will change its debug level to that given with
−d. 
This does not work correctly if specified on the
command-line that starts clvmd. If you want to start clvmd
and enable cluster-wide logging then the command
needs to be issued twice, eg: 
clvmd 
clvmd −d2

−d
[value] 

Set debug logging level. If
−d is specified without a value then 1
is assumed. Value can be: 
0 — Disabled 
1 — Sends debug logs to stderr (implies
−f) 
2 — Sends debug logs to syslog(3)

−E
lock_uuid 

Pass lock uuid to be reacquired
exclusively when clvmd is restarted.

−f

Don’t fork, run in the
foreground.

−h

Show help information.

−I
cluster_manager 

Selects the cluster manager to
use for locking and internal communications. As it is quite
possible to have multiple managers available on the same
system you might have to manually specify this option to
override the search.

By default,
omit −I is equivalent to -Iauto. Clvmd
will use the first cluster manager that succeeds, and it
checks them in a predefined order cman,
corosync, openais. The available managers will
be listed by order as part of the clvmd −h
output.

−R

Tells all the running instance
of clvmd in the cluster to reload their device cache
and re-read the lvm configuration file lvm.conf(5).
This command should be run whenever the devices on a cluster
system are changed.

−S

Tells the running clvmd
to exit and reexecute itself, for example at the end of a
package upgrade. The new instance is instructed to reacquire
any locks in the same state as they were previously held.
(Alternative methods of restarting the daemon have the side
effect of changing exclusive LV locks into shared
locks.)

−t
timeout 

Specifies the timeout
for commands to run around the cluster. This should not be
so small that commands with many disk updates to do will
fail, so you may need to increase this on systems with very
large disk farms. The default is 60 seconds.

−T
start_timeout 

Specifies the start timeout for
clvmd daemon startup. If the daemon does not report
that it has started up within this time then the parent
command will exit with status of 5. This does NOT mean that
clvmd has not started! What it means is that the
startup has been delayed for some reason; the most likely
cause of this is an inquorate cluster though it could be due
to locking latencies on a cluster with large numbers of
logical volumes. If you get the return code of 5 it is
usually not necessary to restart clvmd it will start
as soon as that blockage has cleared. This flag is to allow
startup scripts to exit in a timely fashion even if the
cluster is stalled for some reason.

The default is
0 (no timeout) and the value is in seconds.
Don’t set this too small or you will experience
spurious errors. 10 or 20 seconds might be sensible.

This timeout
will be ignored if you start clvmd with the
−d.

−V

Display the version of the
cluster LVM daemon.

NOTES

Activation

In a clustered VG, clvmd is used for activation, and the
following values are possible with lvchange/vgchange
−a:

y|sy

clvmd activates the LV in shared mode (with a shared
lock), allowing multiple nodes to activate the LV
concurrently. If the LV type prohibits shared access, such
as an LV with a snapshot, an exclusive lock is automatically
used instead. clvmd attempts to activate the LV concurrently
on all nodes.

ey

clvmd activates the LV in exclusive mode (with an
exclusive lock), allowing a single node to activate the LV.
clvmd attempts to activate the LV concurrently on all nodes,
but only one will succeed.

ly

clvmd attempts to activate the LV only on the local
node. If the LV type allows concurrent access, then shared
mode is used, otherwise exclusive.

n

clvmd attempts to deactivate the LV on all nodes.

ln

clvmd attempts to deactivate the LV on the local
node.
