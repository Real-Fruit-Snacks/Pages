DESCRIPTION

The routines
described in this document are part of the libwrap.a
library. They implement a rule-based access control language
with optional shell commands that are executed when a rule
fires.

request_init()
initializes a structure with information about a client
request. request_set() updates an already initialized
request structure. Both functions take a variable-length
list of key-value pairs and return their first argument. The
argument lists are terminated with a zero key value. All
string-valued arguments are copied. The expected keys (and
corresponding value types) are: 
RQ_FILE (int)

The file descriptor associated
with the request.

RQ_CLIENT_NAME (char *)

The client host name.

RQ_CLIENT_ADDR (char *)

A printable representation of
the client network address.

RQ_CLIENT_SIN (struct
sockaddr_in *)

An internal representation of
the client network address and port. The contents of the
structure are not copied.

RQ_SERVER_NAME (char *)

The hostname associated with
the server endpoint address.

RQ_SERVER_ADDR (char *)

A printable representation of
the server endpoint address.

RQ_SERVER_SIN (struct
sockaddr_in *)

An internal representation of
the server endpoint address and port. The contents of the
structure are not copied.

RQ_DAEMON (char *)

The name of the daemon process
running on the server host.

RQ_USER (char *)

The name of the user on whose
behalf the client host makes the request.

hosts_access()
consults the access control tables described in the
hosts_access(5) manual page. When internal endpoint
information is available, host names and client user names
are looked up on demand, using the request structure as a
cache. hosts_access() returns zero if access should be
denied. fromhost() must be called before hosts_access().

hosts_ctl() is
a wrapper around the request_init() and hosts_access()
routines with a perhaps more convenient interface (though it
does not pass on enough information to support automated
client username lookups). The client host address, client
host name and username arguments should contain valid data
or STRING_UNKNOWN. hosts_ctl() returns zero if access should
be denied.

The
allow_severity and deny_severity variables
determine how accepted and rejected requests may be logged.
They must be provided by the caller and may be modified by
rules in the access control tables.

DIAGNOSTICS

Problems are
reported via the syslog daemon.

BUGS

hosts_access()
uses the strtok() library function. This may interfere with
other code that relies on strtok().
