NAME

sctp_recvmsg -
Receive a message from a SCTP socket.

SYNOPSIS

#include

#include  
#include 

int
sctp_recvmsg(int sd, void * msg,
size_t len, 
struct sockaddr * from, socklen_t *
fromlen, 
struct sctp_sndrcvinfo * sinfo, int *
msg_flags);

DESCRIPTION

sctp_recvmsg
is a wrapper library function that can be used to receive a
message from a socket while using the advanced features of
SCTP. sd is the socket descriptor on which the
message pointed to by msg of length len is
received.

If from
is not NULL, the source address of the message is filled in.
The argument fromlen is a value-result parameter.
initialized to the size of the buffer associated with
from , and modified on return to indicate the actual
size of the address stored.

sinfo is
a pointer to a sctp_sndrcvinfo structure to be filled upon
receipt of the message. msg_flags is a pointer to a
integer that is filled with any message flags like
MSG_NOTIFICATION or MSG_EOR. The value of
msg_flags pointer should be initialized to 0 to avoid
unexpected behavior; msg_flags is also used as an
input flags argument to recvmsg function.

RETURN VALUE

On success,
sctp_recvmsg returns the number of bytes received or
-1 if an error occurred.
