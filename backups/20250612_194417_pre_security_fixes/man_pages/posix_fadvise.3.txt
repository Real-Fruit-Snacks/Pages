Linux.

NAME

posix_fadvise
— file advisory information (ADVANCED
REALTIME)

SYNOPSIS

#include

int
posix_fadvise(int fd, off_t offset, off_t
len, int advice);

DESCRIPTION

The
posix_fadvise() function shall advise the
implementation on the expected behavior of the application
with respect to the data in the file associated with the
open file descriptor, fd, starting at offset
and continuing for len bytes. The specified range
need not currently exist in the file. If len is zero,
all data following offset is specified. The
implementation may use this information to optimize handling
of the specified data. The posix_fadvise() function
shall have no effect on the semantics of other operations on
the specified data, although it may affect the performance
of other operations.

The advice to
be applied to the data is specified by the advice
parameter and may be one of the following values: 
POSIX_FADV_NORMAL

Specifies that the application
has no advice to give on its behavior with respect to the
specified data. It is the default characteristic if no
advice is given for an open file.

POSIX_FADV_SEQUENTIAL

Specifies that the application
expects to access the specified data sequentially from lower
offsets to higher offsets.

POSIX_FADV_RANDOM

Specifies that the application
expects to access the specified data in a random order.

POSIX_FADV_WILLNEED

Specifies that the application
expects to access the specified data in the near future.

POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED

Specifies that the application
expects that it will not access the specified data in the
near future.

POSIX_FADV_NOREUSE

Specifies that the application
expects to access the specified data once and then not reuse
it thereafter.

These values
are defined in .

RETURN VALUE

Upon successful
completion, posix_fadvise() shall return zero;
otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the
error.

ERRORS

The
posix_fadvise() function shall fail if:

EBADF

The fd argument is not a valid file
descriptor. 

EINVAL

The value of advice is invalid, or the value of
len is less than zero.

ESPIPE

The fd argument is associated with a pipe or
FIFO. 

The
following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES

None.

APPLICATION USAGE

The
posix_fadvise() function is part of the Advisory
Information option and need not be provided on all
implementations.

RATIONALE

None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS

None.
