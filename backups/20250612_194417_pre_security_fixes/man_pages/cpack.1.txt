NAME

cpack - CPack
Command-Line Reference

SYNOPSIS

cpack
[]

DESCRIPTION

The
cpack executable is the CMake packaging program. It
generates installers and source packages in a variety of
formats.

For each
installer or package format, cpack has a specific
backend, called "generator". A generator is
responsible for generating the required inputs and invoking
the specific package creation tools. These installer or
package generators are not to be confused with the makefile
generators of the cmake command.

All supported
generators are specified in the cpack-generators
manual. The command cpack --help prints a list of
generators supported for the target platform. Which of them
are to be used can be selected through the
CPACK_GENERATOR variable or through the command-line
option -G.

The
cpack program is steered by a configuration file
written in the CMake language. Unless chosen
differently through the command-line option --config,
the file CPackConfig.cmake in the current directory
is used.

In the standard
CMake workflow, the file CPackConfig.cmake is
generated by the cmake executable, provided the
CPack module is included by the project's
CMakeLists.txt file.

OPTIONS

-G

 is a
semicolon-separated list of generator names.
cpack will iterate through this list and produce
package(s) in that generator's format according to the
details provided in the CPackConfig.cmake
configuration file. If this option is not given, the
CPACK_GENERATOR variable determines the default set
of generators that will be used.

-C 

Specify the project
configuration(s) to be packaged (e.g. Debug,
Release, etc.), where  is a
semicolon-separated list. When the CMake project uses
a multi-configuration generator such as Xcode or Visual
Studio, this option is needed to tell cpack which
built executables to include in the package. The user is
responsible for ensuring that the configuration(s) listed
have already been built before invoking cpack.

-D
=

Set a CPack variable. This will
override any value set for  in the input
file read by cpack.

--config

Specify the configuration file
read by cpack to provide the packaging details. By
default, CPackConfig.cmake in the current directory
will be used.

-V, --verbose

Run cpack with verbose
output. This can be used to show more details from the
package generation tools and is suitable for project
developers.

--debug

Run cpack with debug
output. This option is intended mainly for the developers of
cpack itself and is not normally needed by project
developers.

--trace

Put the underlying cmake
scripts in trace mode.

--trace-expand

Put the underlying cmake
scripts in expanded trace mode.

-P

Override/define the value of
the CPACK_PACKAGE_NAME variable used for packaging.
Any value set for this variable in the
CPackConfig.cmake file will then be ignored.

-R

Override/define the value of
the CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION variable used for
packaging. It will override a value set in the
CPackConfig.cmake file or one automatically computed
from CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MAJOR,
CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MINOR and
CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_PATCH.

-B

Override/define
CPACK_PACKAGE_DIRECTORY, which controls the directory
where CPack will perform its packaging work. The resultant
package(s) will be created at this location by default and a
_CPack_Packages subdirectory will also be created
below this directory to use as a working area during package
creation.

--vendor

Override/define
CPACK_PACKAGE_VENDOR.

cmake-presets(7).
