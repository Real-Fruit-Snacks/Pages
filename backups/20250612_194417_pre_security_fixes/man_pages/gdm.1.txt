NAME

GDM − The
GNOME Display Manager

SYNOPSIS

gdm
[options] 
gdm-binary [options] 
gdmsetup [options] 
gdm-stop 
gdm-restart 
gdm-safe-restart

DESCRIPTION

GDM is a
replacement for XDM, the X Display Manager. Unlike its
competitors (X3DM, KDM, WDM) GDM was written from scratch
and does not contain any original XDM / X Consortium code.
GDM runs and manages the X servers for both local and remote
logins (using XDMCP). See http://www.jirka.org/gdm.html for
more details.

gdm is
just a script that runs the actual gdm-binary
executable. gdm-stop is a script that stops the
current running daemon immediately, gdm-restart
restarts the current daemon immediately and
gdm-safe-restart restarts the current daemon after
everyone has logged out. gdmsetup is a graphical tool
for easily changing the most commonly used options.

For full
documentation see the GNOME help browser under the GNOME
/ System section.

OPTIONS

gdm and
thus also gdm-binary accept the following options:

−nodaemon

Do not fork into the
background

−−no−console

No console (local) servers to
be run

−−preserve−ld−vars

Preserve LD_* variables

−−version

Print the GDM version

−−help

Print simple description of accepted options

gdmsetup
accepts all standard GNOME options.

CONFIGURATION

Configuration
is done either by running gdmsetup or by editting the
/etc/X11/gdm/gdm.conf (usually, could also be
/etc/gdm/gdm.conf) file. The graphical tool does not support
all the options possible so editting the configuration file
is sometimes necessary.
