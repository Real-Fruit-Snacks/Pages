NAME

sd_event_source_set_exit_on_failure,
sd_event_source_get_exit_on_failure - Set or retrieve the
exit-on-failure feature of event sources

SYNOPSIS

#include

int
sd_event_source_set_exit_on_failure(sd_event_source *source,
int b); 

int
sd_event_source_get_exit_on_failure(sd_event_source *source); 

DESCRIPTION

sd_event_source_set_exit_on_failure()
may be used to set/unset the exit-on-failure flag of the
event source object specified as source. The flag
defaults to off. If on and the callback function set for the
event source returns a failure code (i.e. a negative value)
the event loop is exited too, using the callback return code
as the exit code for sd_event_exit(3). If off, the
event source is disabled but the event loop continues to
run. Setting this flag is useful for "dominant"
event sources that define the purpose and reason for the
event loop, and whose failure hence should propagate to the
event loop itself â€” as opposed to
"auxiliary" event sources whose failures should
remain local and affect the event source, but not propagate
further.

sd_event_source_get_exit_on_failure()
may be used to query the flag currently set for the event
source object source.

RETURN VALUE

On success,
sd_event_source_set_exit_on_failure() returns a
non-negative integer.
sd_event_source_get_exit_on_failure() returns 0 if
the flag is off, > 0 if the flag is on. On failure, both
return a negative errno-style error code.

Errors

Returned errors may indicate the following problems:

-EINVAL

source is not a valid
pointer to an sd_event_source object.

Added in
version 247.

-EDOM

The event source refers to an
exit event source (as created with
sd_event_add_exit(3)), for which this functionality
is not supported.

Added in
version 247.

NOTES

Functions
described here are available as a shared library, which can
be compiled against and linked to with the
libsystemd pkg-config(1) file.

The code
described here uses getenv(3), which is declared to
be not multi-thread-safe. This means that the code calling
the functions described here must not call setenv(3)
from a parallel thread. It is recommended to only do calls
to setenv() from an early phase of the program when
no other threads have been started.

HISTORY

sd_event_source_set_exit_on_failure()
and sd_event_source_get_exit_on_failure() were added
in version 247.
