NAME

basis - plot a
finite element basis (rheolef-7.2)

SYNOPSIS

basis name
[element] [options]

DESCRIPTION

View a finite
element polynomial basis on a given reference element (see
reference_element(6)). Alternatively, it could show
the interpolation nodes.

EXAMPLES

basis P5 t 
basis P5[warburton] t 
basis P5[warburton,monomial] t 
basis ’trace(P3d)’ t

basis P3 t
-node 
basis P5 t -node-side 0 
basis P5 t -node-side 1 
basis P3 T -node 
basis B7 t 
basis S7 t 
basis RT0 t 
basis RT3 t -node 
basis ’trace_n(RT5d)’ t -node 
basis P3d T -node-side 1 
basis ’trace_n(RT5d)’ T -node-side 1

BASIS AND ELEMENT SPECIFICATIONS

The basis
name argument is specified as for the space
and basis constructor class argument (see
space(2) and basis(2)). The element
argument is one of e, t, q,
T, P, H (see
reference_element(6)). The gnuplot render is
used for visualization.

THE RAW BASIS

-raw 
-fem

A raw basis is
used for computing the Vandermonde matrix and building the
Lagrange basis. The raw basis is either monomial,
Dubiner or Bernstein while
Dubiner is the default. This raw basis is hiden by
default: it is represented by using the -raw option
while -fem switch back to the default finite
element basis representation. When the basis family is
either M, for monomial or D for
Dubiner, there is no ambiguity, and the
-raw option could be omitted. Conversely, when the
basis family is B, for Bernstein, then,
there is an ambiguity and this option should be used.

Here is an
example of raw basis visualization:

basis M4 t 
basis D5 e 
basis B5 e -raw

Here, the
-raw option is used to disambiguate 
between the Bernstein basis as finite element basis and the
Bernstein basis as a raw basis.

REDERING OPTIONS

The
basis command supports several modes of
visualization:

-ndof

Print the basis
size, i.e. the number of degrees of freedom (ndof).

-poly

Represents the
polynomial functions in elevation, for 1D and 2D elements
(3D elements visualization not yet supported). All basis
polynomials are showed in an animation.

-node

Represents the
node location, with distinct colors for each dimension
associated to.

-node-side

Represents the
node location, restricted on a specific side.

OTHERS OPTIONS

-[no]verbose

Print messages
related to graphic files created and command system calls
(this is the default).

-[no]clean

Clear temporary
graphic files (this is the default).

-[no]execute

Execute graphic
command (this is the default). The -noexecute
variant is useful in conjunction with the -verbose
and -noclean options in order to modify some render
options by hand.

LIMITATIONS

Polynomial
visualization in 3D are not yet supported: future
development will use paraview with volume mode and animation
for scanning all basis polynomials.
