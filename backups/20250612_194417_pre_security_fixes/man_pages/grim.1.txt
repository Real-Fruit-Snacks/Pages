NAME

grim - grab
images from a Wayland compositor

SYNOPSIS

grim
[options...] [output-file]

DESCRIPTION

grim is a
command-line utility to take screenshots of Wayland
desktops. For now it requires support for the screencopy
protocol to work. Support for the xdg-output protocol is
optional, but improves fractional scaling support.

grim will write
an image to output-file, or to a timestamped file
name in $GRIM_DEFAULT_DIR if not specified. If
$GRIM_DEFAULT_DIR is not set, it falls back first to
$XDG_PICTURES_DIR and then to the current working
directory. If output-file is -, grim will
write the image to the standard output instead.

OPTIONS

-h

Show help message and quit.

-s

Set the output image’s
scale factor to factor. By default, the scale factor
is set to the highest of all outputs.

-g
",
x"

Set the region to capture, in
layout coordinates.

If set to
-, read the region from the standard input
instead.

-t

Set the output image’s
file format to type. By default, the filetype is set
to png, valid values are png, jpeg or
ppm.

-q

Set the output jpeg’s
filetype compression rate to quality. By default, the
jpeg quality is 80, valid values are between
0-100.

-l

Set the output PNG’s
filetype compression level to level. By default, the
PNG compression level is 6 on a scale from 0 to 9. Level 9
gives the highest compression ratio, but may be slow; level
1 gives a lower compression ratio, but is faster. Level 0
does no compression at all, and produces very large files;
it can be useful when grim is used in a pipeline with other
commands.

-o

Set the output name to
capture.

-c

Include cursors in the
screenshot.
