NAME

lat_rpc -
measure interprocess communication latency via Sun RPC

SYNOPSIS

lat_rpc
-s 
lat_rpc [ -P  ] [ -W
 ] [ -N  ] [
-p tcp|udp ] hostname [ udp|tcp ]

lat_rpc -S hostname

DESCRIPTION

lat_rpc
is a client/server program that measures interprocess
communication latencies. The benchmark passes a token back
and forth between the two processes (this sort of benchmark
is frequently referred to as a ’’hot
potato’’ benchmark). No other work is done in
the processes.

This benchmark
may be compared to the TCP and UDP forms of the same
benchmark to accurately see the cost of using RPC versus the
cost of using plain old TCP or UDP sockets. It is worth
noting that the RPC form is passing back and forth a single
byte, not some long complicated record.

lat_rpc
has three forms of usage: as a server (-s), as a client
(lat_rpc localhost), and as a shutdown (lat_rpc -S
localhost).

The client form
may specify the protocol over which the RPCs are performed.
The default is to measure performance for both udp
and tcp.

OUTPUT

The reported
time is in microseconds per round trip and includes the
total time, i.e., the context switching overhead is
includeded. Output format is like so

RPC/udp
latency using localhost: 1344 microseconds 
RPC/tcp latency using localhost: 2089 microseconds
