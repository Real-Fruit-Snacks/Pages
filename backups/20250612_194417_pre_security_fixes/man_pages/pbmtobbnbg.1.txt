pbmtobbnbg -
convert a PBM image into BitGraph graphics

SYNOPSIS

pbmtobbng
[rasterop] [x y]

DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

pbmtobbnbg
reads a PBM image as input and produces BBN BitGraph
terminal Display Pixel Data (DPD) sequence as output.

The rasterop
can be specified on the command line. If you omit this, the

program uses 3 (replace). You can also specify a position in
(x,y) 
coordinates. If you give both, the rasterop comes first. The
PBM always 
comes from Standard Input.

Note that there
is no bbnbgtopbm tool.

OPTIONS

There are no
command line options defined specifically for
