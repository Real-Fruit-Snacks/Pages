NAME

curl_mime_data
- set a mime part’s body data from memory

SYNOPSIS

#include

CURLcode
curl_mime_data(curl_mimepart * part, const
char * data , size_t
datasize);

DESCRIPTION

curl_mime_data(3)
sets a mime part’s body content from memory data.

data
points to the data bytes: those are copied to the part and
their storage may safely be reused after call.
datasize is the number of data bytes: it can be set
to CURL_ZERO_TERMINATED to indicate data is a
null-terminated character string. part is the
part’s to assign contents to.

Setting a
part’s contents twice is valid: only the value set by
the last call is retained. It is possible to unassign
part’s contents by setting data to NULL.

Setting very
large data is memory consuming: one might consider using
curl_mime_data_cb(3) in such a case.

AVAILABILITY

As long as at
least one of HTTP, SMTP or IMAP is enabled. Added in
7.56.0.

RETURN VALUE

CURLE_OK or a
CURL error code upon failure.

EXAMPLE

curl_mime
*mime; 
curl_mimepart *part;

/* create a
mime handle */ 
mime = curl_mime_init(easy);

/* add a part
*/ 
part = curl_mime_addpart(mime);

/* add data to
the part */ 
curl_mime_data(part, "raw contents to send",
CURL_ZERO_TERMINATED);
