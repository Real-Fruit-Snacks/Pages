SYNOPSIS

#include

void
pcre2_convert_context_free(pcre2_convert_context
*cvcontext);

DESCRIPTION

This function
is part of an experimental set of pattern conversion
functions. It frees the memory occupied by a convert
context, using the memory freeing function from the general
context with which it was created, or free() if that
was not set. If the argument is NULL, the function returns
immediately without doing anything.

The pattern
conversion functions are described in the
pcre2convert documentation.
