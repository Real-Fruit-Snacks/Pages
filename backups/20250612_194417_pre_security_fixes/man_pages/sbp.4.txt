NAME

sbp — Serial Bus
Protocol 2 (SBP-2) Mass Storage Devices driver

SYNOPSIS

kldload firewire 
kldload cam 
kldload sbp

or

device sbp

device firewire 
device scbus 
device da 
device cd 
device pass

DESCRIPTION

The sbp driver provides
support for SBP-2 devices that attach to the FireWire (IEEE
1394) port. It should work with SBP-2 devices which the CAM
layer supports, for example, HDDs, CDROM drives and DVD
drives.

Some users
familiar with umass(4) might wonder why the device is not
detached at the CAM layer when the device is unplugged. It
is detached only if the device has not been plugged again
during several bus resets. This is for preventing to detach
an active file system even when the device cannot be probed
correctly for some reason after a bus reset or when the
device is temporary disconnected because the user changes
the bus topology. If you want to force to detach the device,
run ’’fwcontrol −r’’
several times or set hw.firewire.hold_count=0 by
sysctl(8).

Some (broken)
HDDs do not work well with tagged queuing. If you have
problems with such drives, try ’’camcontrol
[device id] tags -N 1’’ to disable tagged
queuing.
