NAME

pmFreeLabelSets
- release storage allocated for performance metric
labels

C SYNOPSIS

#include

void
pmFreeLabelSets(pmLabelSet *sets, int
nsets);

cc ...
-lpcp

DESCRIPTION

The array of
label sets returned by pmLookupLabels(3) and
related APIs are allocated below the Performance Metrics
Application Programming Interface (PMAPI) using a variety of
calls to the systemâ€™s dynamic memory allocation (i.e.
malloc(3)) interfaces.

Applications
should call pmFreeLabelSets to release the storage
previously allocated for the label sets array when
access to the structure is no longer needed. The return
value from pmLookupLabels indicates the number of
elements in the label sets array, and this should be
passed in using the nsets parameter.

Under no
circumstances should an application use
free(labelset) to release storage previously
allocated for a pmLabelSet by
pmLookupLabels(3) or related APIs.

To simplify
error handling, if sets is NULL then
pmFreeLabelSets simply returns without freeing any
storage.
