HISTORY

pamtodjvurle
was new in Netpbm 10.22 (April 2004) but a program that did
almost the same thing, called ppmtodjvurle, was in
Netpbm 10.21 (March 2004). The latter was written and
contributed to Netpbm by Scott Pakin
pbm [AT] pakin.org>. pamtodjvurle uses
techniques taken from ppmtodjvurle, but no code is
copied between them.
