NAME

lat_fcntl -
fcntl file locking benchmark

SYNOPSIS

lat_ctx
[ -d ] [ -e ] [ -S ] serverhost
[ port ]

DESCRIPTION

lat_http
is a client/server program that measures simple http
transaction latencies. It has its own HTTP server, and it is
meant to simply measure the minimum overall costs of simple
HTTP ’’GET’’ transactions. It does
not measure the performance of third-party HTTP servers.

The client
simply makes a series of HTTP GET requests for files. The
files are a fixed set of files included with the benchmark.
No special care was made to ensure that the file sizes match
and predetermined distribution.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

Funding for the
development of this tool was provided by Sun Microsystems
Computer Corporation.
