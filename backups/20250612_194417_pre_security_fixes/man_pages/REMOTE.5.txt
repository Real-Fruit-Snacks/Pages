REMOTE(5) BSD File Formats Manual REMOTE(5)

NAME

remote — remote
host description file

DESCRIPTION

The systems known by tip(1) and
their attributes are stored in an ASCII file which is
structured somewhat like the termcap(5) file. Each line in
the file provides a description for a single system.
Fields are separated by a colon
(’’:’’). Lines ending in a \
character with an immediately following newline are
continued on the next line.

The first entry
is the name(s) of the host system. If there is more than one
name for a system, the names are separated by vertical bars.
After the name of the system comes the fields of the
description. A field name followed by an ’=’
sign indicates a string value. A field name followed by a
’#’ sign indicates a numeric value.

Entries named
’’tip*’’ and
’’cu*’’ are used as default entries
by tip(1), and the cu(1) interface to tip, as
follows. When tip is invoked with only a phone
number, it looks for an entry of the form
’’tip300’’, where 300 is the data
rate with which the connection is to be made. When the
cu interface is used, entries of the form
’’cu300’’ are used.

CAPABILITIES

Capabilities are either strings
(str), numbers (num), or boolean flags (bool). A string
capability is specified by capability=value; for
example, ’’dv=/dev/harris’’. A
numeric capability is specified by capability#value;
for example, ’’xa#99’’. A boolean
capability is specified by simply listing the
capability.

at

(str) Auto call
unit type.

br

(num) The data
rate (bits per second) used for communications on the serial
port. When a modem is used, the data rate used to
communicate with the remote modem may be different than this
rate. This is a decimal number. The default rate is 9600
bits per second.

cm

(str) An
initial connection message to be sent to the remote host.
For example, if a host is reached through a port selector,
this might be set to the appropriate sequence required to
switch to the host.

cu

(str) Call unit
if making a phone call. Default is the same as the
’dv’ field.

di

(str)
Disconnect message sent to the host when a disconnect is
requested by the user.

du

(bool) This
host is on a dial-up line.

dv

(str) UNIX
device(s) to open to establish a connection. If this file
refers to a terminal line, tip(1) attempts to perform an
exclusive open on the device to ensure only one user at a
time has access to the port.

el

(str)
Characters marking an end-of-line. The default is NULL.
’~’ escapes are only recognized by tip
after one of the characters in ’el’, or after a
carriage-return.

fs

(str) Frame
size for transfers. The default frame size is equal to
BUFSIZ.

hd

(bool) The host
uses half-duplex communication, local echo should be
performed.

ie

(str) Input
end-of-file marks. The default is NULL.

oe

(str) Output
end-of-file string. The default is NULL. When tip is
transferring a file, this string is sent at end-of-file.

pa

(str) The type
of parity to use when sending data to the host. This may be
one of ’’even’’,
’’odd’’,
’’none’’,
’’zero’’ (always set bit 8 to zero),
’’one’’ (always set bit 8 to 1). The
default is even parity.

pn

(str) Telephone
number(s) for this host. If the telephone number field
contains an @ sign, tip searches the file
/etc/phones file for a list of telephone numbers (see
phones(5)).

tc

(str) Indicates
that the list of capabilities is continued in the named
description. This is used primarily to share common
capability information.

EXAMPLES

Here is a short example showing
the use of the capability continuation feature. It defines a
56k modem connection on the first serial port at 115200 bits
per second, no parity using the Hayes command set with
standard line editing and end of file characters. The
arpavax entry includes everything in the UNIX-57600 entry
plus the phone number for arpavax (in this case an @
character so that it is retrieved from the environment).

UNIX-57600:\

:dv=/dev/cuaa0:el=^D^U^C^S^Q^O@:oe=^D:du:at=hayes:br#115200:pa=none:

arpavax|ax:\ 
:pn=\@:tc=UNIX-57600

FILES 
/etc/remote

The
remote host description file resides in
/etc.

HISTORY

The remote file format
appeared in 4.2BSD.

BUGS

The tip(1) utility uses its own
notion of the serial ports data rate rather than the system
default for a serial port.
