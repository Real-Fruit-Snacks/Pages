NAME

pam_authtok_get
âˆ’ authentication and password management module

SYNOPSIS

pam_authtok_get.so.1

DESCRIPTION

The
pam_authtok_get service module provides password
prompting funtionality to the PAM stack. It implements
pam_sm_authenticate() and pam_sm_chauthtok(),
providing functionality to both the Authentication Stack and
the Password Management Stack.

Authentication
Service 
The implementation of pam_sm_authenticate(3PAM)
prompts the user name if not set and then tries to get the
authentication token from the pam handle. If the token is
not set, it then prompts the user for a password and stores
it in the PAM item PAM_AUTHTOK. This module is
meant to be the first module on an authentication stack
where users are to authenticate using a keyboard.

Password
Management Service 
Due to the nature of the PAM Password Management stack
traversal mechanism, the pam_sm_chauthtok(3PAM)
function is called twice. Once with the
PAM_PRELIM_CHECK flag, and one with the
PAM_UPDATE_AUTHTOK flag.

In the first
(PRELIM) invocation, the implementation of
pam_sm_chauthtok(3PAM) moves the contents of the
PAM_AUTHTOK (current authentication token) to
PAM_OLDAUTHTOK, and subsequentially prompts the user
for a new password. This new password is stored in
PAM_AUTHTOK.

If a previous
module has set PAM_AUTHTOK prior to the invocation of
pam_authtok_get, this module turns into a NO-OP and
immediately returns PAM_SUCCESS.

In the second
(UPDATE) invocation, the user is prompted to Re-enter
his password. The pam_sm_chauthtok implementation verifies
this reentered password with the password stored in
PAM_AUTHTOK. If the passwords match, the module
returns PAM_SUCCESS.

The following
option can be passed to the module:

debug

syslog(3C) debugging information at the
LOG_DEBUG level

RETURN VALUES

The
authentication service returns the following values: 
PAM_SUCCESS

Successfully obtains
authentication token

PAM_SYSTEM_ERR

Fails to retrieve username,
username is NULL or empty

The password
management service returns the following values: 
PAM_SUCCESS

Successfully obtains
authentication token

PAM_AUTHTOK_ERR

Authentication token
manipulation error

NOTES

The interfaces
in libpam(3LIB) are MT-Safe only if each thread
within the multi-threaded application uses its own PAM
handle.

The
pam_unix(5) module might not be supported in a future
release. Similar functionality is provided by
pam_authtok_check(5), pam_authtok_get(5),
pam_authtok_store(5), pam_dhkeys(5),
pam_passwd_auth(5), pam_unix_account(5),
pam_unix_auth(5), and pam_unix_session(5).
