NAME

nrports -
NET/ROM port configuration file.

DESCRIPTION

Nrports
is an ASCII file that contains information about each of the
NET/ROM ports that are to be used. When dealing with an
NET/ROM utility such as call, it takes an optional
argument that is the port name. This port name is a
reference to the line within nrports, which has the
same name. The information on each line contains enough
information to bind the command to a particular NET/ROM
interface, this binding is done by matching the callsign on
the line in nrports with the callsign of the port set
by ifconfig.

The
nrports file may contain comments that begin with a #
in the first column, or a port description in the following
format, each field being delimited by white space:

name callsign
alias paclen description

The field
descriptions are:

name

this is the unique NET/ROM port identifier.

callsign

the callsign of the NET/ROM interface to bind to.

alias

this is the alias of the NET/ROM port.

paclen

is the default packet size for this interface.

description

a free format description of this interface, this field
extends to the end of the line. It may contain spaces.
