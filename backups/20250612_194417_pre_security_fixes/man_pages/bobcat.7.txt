NAME

Bobcat -
Overview of classes in the Bobcat library

DESCRIPTION

The classes of
the Bobcat library may be used after including
bobcat/classname in sources.

Generally,
programs using the Bobcat library must be at least
linked against the Bobcat library. Refer to section
LINKING for more informatin about linking programs to
required libraries.

All classes and
other elements are defined in the FBB namespace. For
some classes manipulators are available, which are
defined in the FBB namespace. An overview of all
manipulators defined in the FBB namespace is provided
by man -e bobcat manipulators.

LINKING

To link
programs against the shared Bobcat library (e.g.,
libbobcat6.so) it is usually sufficient to merely
specify -lbobcat. E.g.,

g++ --std=c++2a
main.cc -lbobcat

Note: libraries
that are indirectly required are no longer automatically
linked to your program. With some classes (e.g.,
BigInt) the libcrypto library must also be
specified, and programs using such classes must be linked
against bobcat and crypto:

g++ --std=c++2a
main.cc -lbobcat -lcrypto

Man-pages of
classes requiring additional libraries mention these
additional libraries in their SYNOPSIS sections.

When using
static linking, the situation is slightly more
problematic, and no general rule can be provided here. To
create a statically linked program the flag -static
must be provided, but in addition the -pthread flag
must often be specified as well. If, when statically linking
your program, undefined references to pthread_...
identifiers are reported, then that is a sure sign that you
need to provide the -pthread flag as well.

When using
static linking additional libraries, not specified at the
man-pages, may also be required. E.g., when using the
Xpointer class and using static linking, the command
becomes:

g++ main.cc
-static -pthread -lbobcat -lX11 -lxcb -lXdmcp -lXau

When
encountering undefined references when using static linking
missing libraries may be suggested by the linker or by its
error messages. Alternatively, the missing libraries may be
found by searching the Internet.
