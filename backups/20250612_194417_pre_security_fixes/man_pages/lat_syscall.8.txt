NAME

lat_syscall -
time simple entry into the operating system

SYNOPSIS

lat_syscall
[ -P  ] [ -W
 ] [ -N  ]
null|read|write|stat|fstat|open [ file ]

DESCRIPTION

null

measures how long it takes to do
getppid(). We chose getppid() because in all
UNIX variants we are aware of, it requires a round-trip
to/from kernel space and the actual work required inside the
kernel is small and bounded.

read

measures how long it takes to read one byte from
/dev/zero. Note that some operating systems do not
support /dev/zero.

write

times how long it takes to write one byte to
/dev/null. This is useful as a lower bound cost on
anything that has to interact with the operating system.

stat

measures how long it takes to stat() a file whose
inode is already cached.

fstat

measures how long it takes to fstat() an open
file whose inode is already cached.

open

measures how long it takes to open() and then
close() a file.

OUTPUT

Output format
is

Null
syscall: 67 microseconds
