NAME

ng_gif_demux â€”
demultiplexer for packets from ng_gif(4) nodes

SYNOPSIS

#include

DESCRIPTION

The ng_gif_demux netgraph
node type demultiplexes the output from ng_gif(4) nodes in
the netgraph(4) networking subsystem.

The gif hook is
meant to be connected to the lower or orphans hook of an
ng_gif(4) node. The inet, inet6, atalk, ipx, atm, natm, and
ns hooks output frames of the given type when they are
received on the gif hook. When a frame is received on one of
these hooks, it is encapsulated and sent out the gif
hook.
