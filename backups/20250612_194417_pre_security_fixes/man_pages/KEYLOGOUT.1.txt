KEYLOGOUT(1) BSD General Commands Manual
KEYLOGOUT(1)

NAME

keylogout — delete
stored secret key

SYNOPSIS

keylogout
[−f]

DESCRIPTION

The keylogout utility
deletes the key stored by the key server process keyserv(8)
to be used by any secure network services, such as NFS.
Further access to the key is revoked, however current
session keys may remain valid till they expire, or are
refreshed. This option will cause any background jobs that
need secure RPC services to fail, and any scheduled
at jobs that need the key to fail. Also since only
one copy is kept on a machine of the key, it is a bad idea
to place this in your .logout file since it will
affect other sessions on the same machine.

The following
option is available:

−f

Forget the
rootkey. This will break secure NFS if it is done on a
server.
