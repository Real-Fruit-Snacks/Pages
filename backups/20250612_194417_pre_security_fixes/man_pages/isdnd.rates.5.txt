NAME

isdnd.rates —
isdn4bsd ISDN management daemon rates description file

DESCRIPTION

The file isdnd.rates
contains descriptions how long charging units last at a
given time of day, day of week and the distance to the
destination. If this file is available, this information may
be used by the isdnd(8) ISDN connection management daemon to
calculate the short hold time for a connection.

The format of a
rate entry line is as follows:

The first field,
the (rate-code) defines a collection of rates (for
each day of the week) which can be referenced in the
isdnd(8) configuration file isdnd.rc(5). This field must
start with the identifier ’’ra’’
followed by a digit in the range of zero to four.

The second
field, the (day-number) selects the day of week for
which this entry defines the rates, where 0 stands for
Sunday, 1 for Monday and so on until the digit 6 which
stands for Saturday.

The rest of the
line consists of one or more space separated fields which
have the following syntax:

start_hour.start_minutes-end_hour.end_minutes:charge_unit_length

Start_hour and
start_minutes define the begin of a time section and
end_hour and end_minutes define the end. Charge_unit_length
define the length of a charging unit in the previously
defined time section. No spaces or tabs are allowed inside
this field. The hour and minutes specifications MUST have
exactly 2 digits, in case just one digit is needed, a
leading 0 must be used.

For example,

14.00-18.00:90

defines, that
between 2:00 PM and 6:00 PM the length of one charging unit
lasts 90 seconds.
