NAME

veth - Virtual
Ethernet Device

DESCRIPTION

The veth
devices are virtual Ethernet devices. They can act as
tunnels between network namespaces to create a bridge to a
physical network device in another namespace, but can also
be used as standalone network devices.

veth
devices are always created in interconnected pairs. A pair
can be created using the command:

# ip link add  type veth peer name 

In the above,
p1-name and p2-name are the names assigned to
the two connected end points.

Packets
transmitted on one device in the pair are immediately
received on the other device. When either devices is down
the link state of the pair is down.

veth
device pairs are useful for combining the network facilities
of the kernel together in interesting ways. A particularly
interesting use case is to place one end of a veth
pair in one network namespace and the other end in another
network namespace, thus allowing communication between
network namespaces. To do this, one can provide the
netns parameter when creating the interfaces:

# ip link add  netns  type veth peer  netns 

or, for an
existing veth pair, move one side to the other
namespace:

# ip link set  netns 

ethtool(8)
can be used to find the peer of a veth network
interface, using commands something like:

#
ip link add ve_A type veth peer name ve_B #
Create veth pair 
# ethtool -S ve_A # Discover interface index
of peer 
NIC statistics: 
peer_ifindex: 16 
# ip link | grep '^16:' # Look up interface

16: ve_B@ve_A:  mtu 1500
qdisc ...
