upload service

SYNOPSIS

/etc/systemd/journal-upload.conf

/run/systemd/journal-upload.conf

/usr/lib/systemd/journal-upload.conf

DESCRIPTION

These files
configure various parameters of
systemd-journal-upload.service(8). See
systemd.syntax(7) for a general description of the
syntax.

CONFIGURATION DIRECTORIES AND PRECEDENCE

The default
configuration is set during compilation, so configuration is
only needed when it is necessary to deviate from those
defaults. The main configuration file is loaded from one of
the listed directories in order of priority, only the first
file found is used: /etc/systemd/, /run/systemd/,
/usr/local/lib/systemd/ [1] ,
/usr/lib/systemd/. The vendor version of the file contains
commented out entries showing the defaults as a guide to the
administrator. Local overrides can also be created by
creating drop-ins, as described below. The main
configuration file can also be edited for this purpose (or a
copy in /etc/ if it's shipped under /usr/), however using
drop-ins for local configuration is recommended over
modifications to the main configuration file.

In addition to
the main configuration file, drop-in configuration snippets
are read from /usr/lib/systemd/*.conf.d/,
/usr/local/lib/systemd/*.conf.d/, and
/etc/systemd/*.conf.d/. Those drop-ins have higher
precedence and override the main configuration file. Files
in the *.conf.d/ configuration subdirectories are sorted by
their filename in lexicographic order, regardless of in
which of the subdirectories they reside. When multiple files
specify the same option, for options which accept just a
single value, the entry in the file sorted last takes
precedence, and for options which accept a list of values,
entries are collected as they occur in the sorted files.

When packages
need to customize the configuration, they can install
drop-ins under /usr/. Files in /etc/ are reserved for the
local administrator, who may use this logic to override the
configuration files installed by vendor packages. Drop-ins
have to be used to override package drop-ins, since the main
configuration file has lower precedence. It is recommended
to prefix all filenames in those subdirectories with a
two-digit number and a dash, to simplify the ordering. This
also defines a concept of drop-in priorities to allow OS
vendors to ship drop-ins within a specific range lower than
the range used by users. This should lower the risk of
package drop-ins overriding accidentally drop-ins defined by
users. It is recommended to use the range 10-40 for drop-ins
in /usr/ and the range 60-90 for drop-ins in /etc/ and
/run/, to make sure that local and transient drop-ins take
priority over drop-ins shipped by the OS vendor.

To disable a
configuration file supplied by the vendor, the recommended
way is to place a symlink to /dev/null in the configuration
directory in /etc/, with the same filename as the vendor
configuration file.

OPTIONS

All options are
configured in the [Upload] section:

URL=

The URL to upload the journal
entries to. See the description of --url= option in
systemd-journal-upload(8) for the description of
possible values. There is no default value, so either this
option or the command-line option must be always present to
make an upload.

Added in
version 232.

ServerKeyFile=

SSL key in PEM format.

Added in
version 232.

ServerCertificateFile=

SSL CA certificate in PEM
format.

Added in
version 232.

TrustedCertificateFile=

SSL CA certificate.

Added in
version 232.

NetworkTimeoutSec=

When network connectivity to
the server is lost, this option configures the time to wait
for the connectivity to get restored. If the server is not
reachable over the network for the configured time,
systemd-journal-upload exits. Takes a value in
seconds (or in other time units if suffixed with
"ms", "min", "h", etc). For
details, see systemd.time(5).

Added in
version 249.

configuration files must be available at all times. If
/usr/local/ is a separate partition, it may not be available
during early boot, and must not be used for
configuration.
