NAME
       Dpkg::BuildTypes - track build types

DESCRIPTION
       The Dpkg::BuildTypes module is used by various tools to track and
       decide what artifacts need to be built.

       The build types are bit constants that are exported by default.
       Multiple types can be ORed.

       Note: This is a private module, its API can change at any time.

CONSTANTS
       BUILD_DEFAULT
           This build is the default.

       BUILD_SOURCE
           This build includes source artifacts.

       BUILD_ARCH_DEP
           This build includes architecture dependent binary artifacts.

       BUILD_ARCH_INDEP
           This build includes architecture independent binary artifacts.

       BUILD_BINARY
           This build includes binary artifacts.

       BUILD_FULL
           This build includes source and binary artifacts.

FUNCTIONS
       build_has_any($bits)
           Return a boolean indicating whether the current build type has any
           of the specified $bits.

       build_has_all($bits)
           Return a boolean indicating whether the current build type has all
           the specified $bits.

       build_has_none($bits)
           Return a boolean indicating whether the current build type has none
           of the specified $bits.

       build_is($bits)
           Return a boolean indicating whether the current build type is the
           specified set of $bits.

       set_build_type($build_type, $build_option, %opts)
           Set the current build type to $build_type, which was specified via
           the $build_option command-line option.

           The function will check and abort on incompatible build type
           assignments, this behavior can be disabled by using the boolean
           option "nocheck".

       set_build_type_from_options($build_types, $build_option, %opts)
           Set the current build type from a list of comma-separated build
           type components.

           The function will check and abort on incompatible build type
           assignments, this behavior can be disabled by using the boolean
           option "nocheck".

       set_build_type_from_targets($build_targets, $build_option, %opts)
           Set the current build type from a list of comma-separated build
           target components.

           The function will check and abort on incompatible build type
           assignments, this behavior can be disabled by using the boolean
           option "nocheck".

       get_build_options_from_type()
           Get the current build type as a set of comma-separated string
           options.
