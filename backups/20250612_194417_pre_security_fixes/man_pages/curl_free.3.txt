NAME

curl_free -
reclaim memory that has been obtained through a libcurl
call

SYNOPSIS

#include

void
curl_free( char *ptr );

DESCRIPTION

curl_free
reclaims memory that has been obtained through a libcurl
call. Use curl_free(3) instead of free() to avoid
anomalies that can result from differences in memory
management between your application and libcurl.

Passing in a
NULL pointer in ptr will make this function return
immediately with no action.
