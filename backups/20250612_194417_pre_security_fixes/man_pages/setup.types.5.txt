NAME

setup.types -
epm gui setup types file format.

DESCRIPTION

The EPM
setup program normally presents the user with a list
of software products to install, which is called a
"custom" software installation.

If a file
called setup.types is present in the package
directory, the user will instead be presented with a list of
installation types. Each type has an associated product list
which determines the products that are installed by default.
If a type has no products associated with it, then it is
treated as a custom installation and the user is presented
with a list of packages to choose from.

FILE FORMAT

The
setup.types file is an ASCII text file consisting of
type and product lines. Comments can be inserted by starting
a line with the pound sign (#). Each installation type is
defined by a line starting with the word TYPE. Products are
defined by a line starting with the word INSTALL:

TYPE Typical
End-User Configuration 
INSTALL foo 
INSTALL foo-help 
TYPE Typical Developer Configuration 
INSTALL foo 
INSTALL foo-help 
INSTALL foo-devel 
INSTALL foo-examples 
TYPE Custom Configuration

In the example
above, three installation types are defined. Since the last
type includes no products, the user will be presented with
the full list of products to choose from.
