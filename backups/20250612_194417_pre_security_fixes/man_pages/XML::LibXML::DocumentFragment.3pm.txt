       XML::LibXML::DocumentFragment - XML::LibXML's DOM L2 Document Fragment
       Implementation

         use XML::LibXML;

DESCRIPTION
       This class is a helper class as described in the DOM Level 2
       Specification. It is implemented as a node without name. All adding,
       inserting or replacing functions are aware of document fragments now.

       As well all unbound nodes (all nodes that do not belong to any document
       sub-tree) are implicit members of document fragments.
