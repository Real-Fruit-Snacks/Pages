NAME

iptables-xml
â€” Convert iptables-save format to XML

SYNOPSIS

iptables-xml
[-c] [-v]

DESCRIPTION

iptables-xml
is used to convert the output of iptables-save into an
easily manipulatable XML format to STDOUT. Use
I/O-redirection provided by your shell to write to a file.

-c, --combine

combine consecutive rules with
the same matches but different targets. iptables does not
currently support more than one target per match, so this
simulates that by collecting the targets from consecutive
iptables rules into one action tag, but only when the rule
matches are identical. Terminating actions like RETURN,
DROP, ACCEPT and QUEUE are not combined with subsequent
targets.

-v, --verbose

Output xml comments containing
the iptables line from which the XML is derived

iptables-xml
does a mechanistic conversion to a very expressive xml
format; the only semantic considerations are for -g and -j
targets in order to discriminate between 
 and  as it helps xml
processing scripts if they can tell the difference between a
target like SNAT and another chain.

Some sample
output is:

tcp 

8443 

Conversion from
XML to iptables-save format may be done using the
iptables.xslt script and xsltproc, or a custom program using
libxsltproc or similar; in this fashion:

xsltproc
iptables.xslt my-iptables.xml | iptables-restore

BUGS

None known as
of iptables-1.3.7 release
