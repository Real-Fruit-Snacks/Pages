NAME

aic — Adaptec
AIC-6260 and AIC-6360 SCSI driver

SYNOPSIS

device aic

In
/boot/device.hints:

hint.aic.0.at="isa"

DESCRIPTION

The aic driver provides
support for the Adaptec AIC-6260 and AIC-6360 SCSI
controller chips. Many systems that use these controller
chips do not have a boot ROM and therefore cannot be booted
from.

HARDWARE

The adapters supported by the
aic driver include:

•

Adaptec AHA-1505 (ISA)

•

Adaptec AHA-1510A, AHA-1510B
(ISA)

•

Adaptec AHA-1520A, AHA-1520B
(ISA)

•

Adaptec AHA-1522A, AHA-1522B
(ISA)

•

Adaptec AHA-1535 (ISA)

•

Creative Labs SoundBlaster SCSI
host adapter (ISA)

•

Adaptec AHA-1460, AHA-1460B,
AHA-1460C, AHA-1460D (PC Card)

BUGS

The driver does not work well
with multiple devices on the SCSI bus. The driver works well
with devices like CDROMs and Tape drives. The driver works
not so well with disk drives. The PC Card version appears to
work better than the ISA version, but that may be due to
differing levels of testing of the devices.
