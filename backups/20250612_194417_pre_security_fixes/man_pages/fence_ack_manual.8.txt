NAME

fence_ack_manual
- a program to override fenced fencing operations

SYNOPSIS

fence_ack_manual
[OPTIONS] nodename

DESCRIPTION

When
fenced(8) fails to fence a node, it retries
indefinately. fence_ack_manual(8) tells fenced to
stop retrying and consider the node fenced.

It is important
that this only be done after the node has been manually
turned off or prevented from writing to shared storage.
Without this manual action and verification, the storage
that fencing protects may become corrupted.

When fenced
fences a node that has no fence devices defined in the
cluster configuration, the fencing operation fails. This
failure will be repeated indefinately until fence_ack_manual
is run by an operator to indicate the node is in a safe
state to proceed. (Defining no fencing devices for node is
the equivalent of using the fence_manual agent in previous
versions.)

OPTIONS

-h

Print a help message describing
available options, then exit.
