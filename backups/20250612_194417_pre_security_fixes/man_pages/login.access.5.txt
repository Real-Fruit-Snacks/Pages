NAME

login.access
− Login access control table

DESCRIPTION

The
login.access file specifies (user, host) combinations
and/or (user, tty) combinations for which a login will be
either accepted or refused.

When someone
logs in, the login.access is scanned for the first
entry that matches the (user, host) combination, or, in case
of non-networked logins, the first entry that matches the
(user, tty) combination. The permissions field of that table
entry determines whether the login will be accepted or
refused.

Each line of
the login access control table has three fields separated by
a ":" character:

permission:users:origins

The first field
should be a "+" (access granted) or
"-" (access denied) character. The second
field should be a list of one or more login names, group
names, or ALL (always matches). The third field
should be a list of one or more tty names (for non-networked
logins), host names, domain names (begin with
"."), host addresses, internet network
numbers (end with "."), ALL (always
matches) or LOCAL (matches any string that does not
contain a "." character). If you run NIS
you can use @netgroupname in host or user patterns.

The
EXCEPT operator makes it possible to write very
compact rules.

The group file
is searched only when a name does not match that of the
logged-in user. Only groups are matched in which users are
explicitly listed: the program does not look at a
user’s primary group id value.
