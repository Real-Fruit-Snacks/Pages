NAME

checkmodule -
SELinux policy module compiler

SYNOPSIS

checkmodule
[-h] [-b] [-c policy_version] [-C] [-E] [-m] [-M] [-U
handle_unknown] [-V] [-o output_file] [input_file]

DESCRIPTION

This manual
page describes the checkmodule command.

checkmodule
is a program that checks and compiles a SELinux security
policy module into a binary representation. It can generate
either a base policy module (default) or a non-base policy
module (-m option); typically, you would build a non-base
policy module to add to an existing module store that
already has a base module provided by the base policy. Use
semodule_package(8) to combine this module with its
optional file contexts to create a policy package, and then
use semodule(8) to install the module package into
the module store and load the resulting policy.

OPTIONS

-b,--binary

Read an existing binary policy
module file rather than a source policy module file. This
option is a development/debugging aid.

-C,--cil

Write CIL policy file rather
than binary policy file.

-E,--werror

Treat warnings as errors

-h,--help

Print usage.

-m

Generate a non-base policy module.

-M,--mls

Enable the MLS/MCS support when
checking and compiling the policy module.

-V,--version

Show policy versions created by
this program.

-o,--output filename

Write a binary policy module
file to the specified filename. Otherwise, checkmodule will
only check the syntax of the module source file and will not
generate a binary module at all.

-U,--handle-unknown

Specify how the kernel should
handle unknown classes or permissions (deny, allow or
reject).

-c policyvers

Specify the policy version,
defaults to the latest.

EXAMPLE

# Build a
MLS/MCS-enabled non-base policy module. 
$ checkmodule -M -m httpd.te -o httpd.mod
