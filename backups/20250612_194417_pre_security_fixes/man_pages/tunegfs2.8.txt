NAME

tunegfs2 - View
and manipulate gfs2 superblocks

SYNOPSIS

tunegfs2
[OPTIONS] /dev/blockdevice

DESCRIPTION

tunegfs2 allows
viewing and manipulating the values contained in a GFS or
GFS2 superblock. It is able to modify the UUID (on
GFS2 only), label, lockproto and
locktable.

The values in
the GFS2 superblock are read only on mount. Any changes on a
live filesystem will not take effect until the next time it
is mounted. Making changes on a live filesystem is not
recommended for this reason.

OPTIONS

-h

this command.

-l

List contents of the filesystem superblock. Includes the
current values of the parameters that can be set by this
program. 

-L

Change the
filesystem label. Note that the GFS2 filesystem label is
also the locktable name.

-o
[lockproto=]
[locktable=]

Set mount
options. Currently supported options include lockproto and
locktable

-U

Set the
filesystem UUID

-V

Print out the information on the version of the
tool.

filesystem format version.
