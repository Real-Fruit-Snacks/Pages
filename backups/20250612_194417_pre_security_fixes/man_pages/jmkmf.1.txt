NAME

jmkmf - runs
jmake with the correct options

SYNOPSIS

jmkmf [
top-level dir [ current dir ] ]

DESCRIPTION

Jmkmf is
a wrapper which calls jmake with the correct options,
defining the symbols TOPDIR (location of the
top-level directory) and CURDIR (current
directory). The generated Makefile.SH is then ran
through /bin/sh to produce a Makefile.

Jmkmf is
useful when you generate a makefile for the first time.

When ran
without arguments, jmkmf will scan the directories
upwards, looking for a .package file marking the top of your
sources. It will then derive the top-level directory and the
name of the current directory by itself.

Once you have a
Makefile.SH generated by jmake, and have run
Configure already, you can use make Makefile.SH to
build the Makefile.SH again and make Makefile to run
the Makefile.SH through /bin/sh. To use the recursive
commands, you have to append an ’s’ at the end
of the name as in make Makefiles.SH and make
Makefiles.
