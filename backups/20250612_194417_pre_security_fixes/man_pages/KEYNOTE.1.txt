DESCRIPTION

For more details on
KeyNote, see RFC 2704.

KEY GENERATION

"keynote keygen"
creates a public/private key of size KeySize, (in
bits) for the algorithm specified by AlgorithmName.
Typical keysizes are 512, 1024, or 2048 (bits). The minimum
key size for DSA keys is 512 (bits). Supported
AlgorithmName identifiers are:

’’dsa-hex:’’

’’dsa-base64:’’

’’rsa-hex:’’

’’rsa-base64:’’

’’x509-hex:’’

’’x509-base64:’’

Notice that the
trailing colon is required. The resulting public key is
stored in file PublicKeyFile. Similarly, the
resulting private key is stored in file
PrivateKeyFile. Either of the filenames can be
specified to be ’’-’’, in which case
the corresponding key(s) will be printed in standard
output.

The optional
parameters print-offset and print-length
specify the offset from the beginning of the line where the
key will be printed, and the number of characters of the key
that will be printed per line. print-length includes
AlgorithmName for the first line and has to be longer
(by at least 2) than AlgorithmName.
print-length also accounts for the line-continuation
character (backslash) at the end of each line, and the
doublequotes at the beginning and end of the key encoding.
Default values are 12 and 50 respectively.

ASSERTION SIGNING

"keynote sign" reads
the assertion contained in AssertionFile and
generates a signature specified by AlgorithmName
using the private key stored in PrivateKeyFile. The
private key is expected to be of the form output by
"keynote keygen". The private key algorithm and
the AlgorithmName specified as an argument are
expected to match. There is no requirement for the internal
or ASCII encodings to match. Valid AlgorithmName
identifiers are:

’’sig-dsa-sha1-hex:’’

’’sig-dsa-sha1-base64:’’

’’sig-rsa-sha1-hex:’’

’’sig-rsa-sha1-base64:’’

’’sig-rsa-md5-hex:’’

’’sig-rsa-md5-base64:’’

’’sig-x509-sha1-hex:’’

’’sig-x509-sha1-base64:’’

Notice that the
trailing colon is required. The resulting signature is
printed in standard output. This can then be added (via
cut-and-paste or some script) at the end of the assertion,
in the Signature field.

The public key
corresponding to the private key in PrivateKeyFile is
expected to already be included in the Authorizer
field of the assertion, either directly or indirectly (i.e.,
through use of a Local-Constants attribute).
Furthermore, the assertion must have a Signature
field (even if it is empty), as the signature is computed on
everything between the KeyNote-Version and
Signature keywords (inclusive), and the
AlgorithmName string.

If the
−v flag is provided, "keynote sign"
will also verify the newly-created signature using the
Authorizer field key.

The optional
parameters print-offset and print-length
specify the offset from the beginning of the line where the
signature will be printed, and the number of characters of
the signature that will be printed per line.
print-length includes AlgorithmName for the
first line and has to be longer (by at least 2) than
AlgorithmName. print-length also accounts for
the line-continuation character (backslash) at the end of
each line, and the doublequotes at the beginning and end of
the signature encoding. Default values are 12 and 50
respectively.

SIGNATURE
VERIFICATION

"keynote sigver" reads
the assertions contained in AssertionFile and
verifies the public-key signatures on all of them.

QUERY TOOL

For each operand that names a
"keynote verify" reads the file and parses the
assertions contained therein (one assertion per file).

Files given with
the −l flag are assumed to contain trusted
assertions (no signature verification is performed, and the
Authorizer field can contain non-key principals.
There should be at least one assertion with the
POLICY keyword in the Authorizer field.

The
−r flag is used to provide a comma-separated
list of return values, in increasing order of compliance
from left to right.

Files given with
the −e flag are assumed to contain environment
variables and their values, in the format:

varname =
"value"

varname
can begin with any letter (upper or lower case) or number,
and can contain underscores. value is a quoted
string, and can contain any character, and escape
(backslash) processing is performed, as specified in the
KeyNote RFC.

The remaining
options are:

−h

Print a usage
message and exit.

−k file

Add a key from file in
the action authorizers.

Exactly one
−r and least one of each −e,
−l, and −k flags should be given
per invocation. If no flags are given, "keynote
verify" prints the usage message and exits with error
code −1.

"keynote
verify" exits with code −1 if there was an error,
and 0 on success.
