DESCRIPTION

"nbdkit-example4-plugin"
is an example nbdkit(1) plugin written in Perl.

The
"size=N" parameter is required. It specifies the
disk size in bytes. A single disk image, initially all
zeroes, is created and can be read and written by all
clients. When nbdkit shuts down the disk image is thrown
away.

Mainly this is
useful for testing and as an example of nbdkit plugins
written in Perl. You should also read
nbdkit-plugin(3) and nbdkit-perl-plugin(3).
Note that nbdkit plugins may be written in C or other
scripting languages.

VERSION

"nbdkit-example4-plugin"
first appeared in nbdkit 1.2.
