NAME

rcp — remote file
copy

SYNOPSIS

rcp
[−46Kpx] [−k realm]
file1 file2 
rcp [−46Kprx]
[−k realm] file ...
directory

DESCRIPTION

The rcp utility copies
files between machines. Each file or directory
argument is either a remote file name of the form
’’rname@rhost:path’’, or a local
file name (containing no ’:’ characters, or a
’/’ before any ’:’s).

The following
options are available:

−4

Use IPv4
addresses only.

−6

Use IPv6
addresses only.

−K

Turn off all
Kerberos authentication.

−k

Request
rcp to obtain tickets for the remote host in realm
realm instead of the remote host’s realm as
determined by krb_realmofhost(3).

−p

Cause
rcp to attempt to preserve (duplicate) in its copies
the modification times and modes of the source files,
ignoring the umask. By default, the mode and owner of
file2 are preserved if it already existed; otherwise
the mode of the source file modified by the umask(2) on the
destination host is used.

−r

If any of the
source files are directories, rcp copies each subtree
rooted at that name; in this case the destination must be a
directory.

−x

Turn on DES
encryption for all data passed by rcp. This may
impact response time and CPU utilization, but provides
increased security.

If path
is not a full path name, it is interpreted relative to the
login directory of the specified user ruser on
rhost, or your current user name if no other remote
user name is specified. A path on a remote host may
be quoted (using \, ", or ´) so that the
metacharacters are interpreted remotely.

The rcp
utility does not prompt for passwords; it performs remote
execution via rsh(1), and requires the same
authorization.

The rcp
utility handles third party copies, where neither source nor
target files are on the current machine.

HISTORY

The rcp command appeared
in 4.2BSD. The version of rcp described here has been
reimplemented with Kerberos in 4.3BSD−Reno.

BUGS

Doesn’t detect all cases
where the target of a copy might be a file in cases where
only a directory should be legal.

Is confused by
any output generated by commands in a .login,
.profile, or .cshrc file on the remote
host.

The destination
user and hostname may have to be specified as
’’rhost.rname’’ when the destination
machine is running the 4.2BSD version of rcp.
