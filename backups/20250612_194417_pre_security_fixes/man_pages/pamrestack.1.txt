NAME

pamrestack -
Rearrange rows of a Netpbm image

SYNOPSIS

pamrestack

[-width=width]

[-trim={fill|crop|abort}]

[-verbose]

[pamfile]

Minimum unique
abbreviations of option are acceptable. You may use double
hyphens instead of single hyphen to denote options. You may
use white space in place of the equals sign to separate an
option name from its value.

DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

pamrestack
rearranges the pixels of a Netpbm image into different size
rows. E.g. if an image is 100 pixels wide and 50 pixels
high, you can rearrange it to 125 wide and 40 high. In that
case, 25 pixels from the start of the 2nd row of the input
would be moved to the end of the 1st row of input, 50 pixels
from the 3rd row would be moved to the 2nd row, etc.

Put another
way, pamrestack arranges all the input rows into one
long sequence and produces output rows therefrom, in FIFO
order.

Input is from
Standard Input if you don’t specify the input file
pamfile.

Output is to
Standard Output.

pamrestack
works on a multi-image stream. It cuts each image in the
stream independently and produces a multi-image stream
output.

OPTIONS

In addition to
the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most
notably -quiet, see
 Common Options ),
pamrestack recognizes the following command line
options: 
-width=width

The width of the output. If
this option is not specified, the output will 
consist of a single row wide enough to contain all the
pixels of the input 
image.

-trim={fill|crop|abort}

This option specifies what to
do when the new width does not cleanly divide the number of
pixels in the input image.

fill

(Default) Complete the final row by adding black pixels
as necessary.

crop

Discard the final partial row. If this means there is
nothing to

output, fail the program.

abort

Fail the program..

-verbose

Print information about the
processing to Standard Error.

USAGE

pamrestack
is a general editor with many possible uses.

•

pamrestack can rearrange into rectangles
single-dimension images

produced by programs such as
ppmhist and pamseq. This makes 
the output easier to examine with a viewer. Conversely,
pamrestack 
can be used to convert a normal rectangular image into one
wide row or one 
tall column if that is desirable for compression,
conversion, or analysis.

•

pamrestack can repair
images corrupted by an incorrect width value

in the header. Images grabbed
from the framebuffer device often exhibit 
this problem.

•

pamrestack can be used
with pamdice, pamundice,

pamcat, etc. to divide
and combine images in the process of 
interlacing.

EXAMPLES

•

Rearrange the one-dimensional
output of pamseq into a square:

pamseq 3 255 |
pamrestack -width=4096

•

Combine two files, each 600
pixels wide, one with the odd rows and

another with the even rows, to
construct an interlaced image:

pamcat
-leftright oddrows.ppm evenrows.ppm | pamrestack
-width=600

•

Like the above, but invert all
pixels in the even rows left to right

to produce a serpentine
interlace:

pamflip
-leftright evenrows.ppm | 
pamcat -leftright oddrows.ppm - | 
pamrestack -width 600
