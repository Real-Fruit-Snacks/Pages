NAME

yada −
Yet Another Debianisation Aid

SYNOPSIS

yada
yada

yada
rebuild [file]

DESCRIPTION

yada is
a Debian packaging helper. It is intended to keep all the
information relating to building and cleaning the source and
binary packages into a single place, and to allow you to
specify as much as possible of this declaratively. The
’’single place’’ is an augmented
Debian control file named debian/packages, whose
format is described in packages(7).

The basic idea
is very simple: everything that used to be scattered amongst
many little files in your debian/ directory is now
concentrated into a single file, debian/packages.
There are only a couple of exceptions:
debian/changelog is unchanged, and optional
debian/yada is the yada script. debian/rules,
debian/control and optional debian/templates
are now generated from debian/packages by
yada. Most of the other files in debian/ will
then likely be redundant.

So the only
thing you now need to know to switch to yada is how
to write debian/packages! See packages(7) for
the gory details.

When
you’ve written debian/packages, you’ll
want to run yada yada in order to install the
changelog file into your debian/ directory,
and then run yada generate in order to generate your
new debian/rules and debian/control. After
that, your rules file should automatically regenerate
both itself and debian/control as necessary. Failing
that, run yada generate rules or yada generate
control as required.

OPTIONS

yada

This command creates an skeleton
debian/packages file for you to fill in, if you
don’t already have one and creates
debian/changelog for initial release.

rebuild rules

yada reads
debian/packages and generates a new rules
file, debian/rules. Note that any existing rules file
will be overwritten, and no backup will be kept.

rebuild control

yada reads
debian/packages and generates a new control
file, debian/control. Note that any existing control
file will be overwritten, and no backup will be kept.

rebuild templates

yada reads
debian/packages and generates a new optional
templates file, debian/templates. Note that
any existing templates file will be overwritten, and no
backup will be kept. This file is created only if
debian/packages contains any Templates: field.
The file might be used with debconf-updatepo(1)
command of po-debconf(7) system to regenerate DebConf
translations located in debian/po/ directory.

rebuild

Regenerates all above required files if they don’t
exists already.

FILES

debian/packages

debian/yada

the script which controls

DIAGNOSTICS

yada prints an
error message and bails out with a non-zero exit code if it
detects an error.

BUGS

This is the
kind of software which cannot be bug−free; different
people will want it to do different things. If you find a
real bug, or you think a feature should work differently,
report it via the Debian bug tracking system, and I’ll
do my best.
