NAME

sssd-simple -
the configuration file for SSSD's 'simple' access-control
provider

DESCRIPTION

This manual
page describes the configuration of the simple
access-control provider for sssd(8). For a detailed
syntax reference, refer to the “FILE FORMAT”
section of the sssd.conf(5) manual page.

The simple
access provider grants or denies access based on an access
or deny list of user or group names. The following rules
apply:

• If all
lists are empty, access is granted

• If any
list is provided, the order of evaluation is allow,deny.
This means that any matching deny rule will supersede any
matched allow rule.

• If
either or both "allow" lists are provided, all
users are denied unless they appear in the list.

• If only
"deny" lists are provided, all users are granted
access unless they appear in the list.

CONFIGURATION OPTIONS

Refer to the
section “DOMAIN SECTIONS” of the
sssd.conf(5) manual page for details on the
configuration of an SSSD domain.

simple_allow_users
(string)

Comma separated list of users
who are allowed to log in.

simple_deny_users
(string)

Comma separated list of users
who are explicitly denied access.

simple_allow_groups
(string)

Comma separated list of groups
that are allowed to log in. This applies only to groups
within this SSSD domain. Local groups are not evaluated.

simple_deny_groups
(string)

Comma separated list of groups
that are explicitly denied access. This applies only to
groups within this SSSD domain. Local groups are not
evaluated.

Specifying no
values for any of the lists is equivalent to skipping it
entirely. Beware of this while generating parameters for the
simple provider using automated scripts.

Please note
that it is an configuration error if both,
simple_allow_users and simple_deny_users, are defined.

EXAMPLE

The following
example assumes that SSSD is correctly configured and
example.com is one of the domains in the [sssd]
section. This examples shows only the simple access
provider-specific options.

[domain/example.com]

access_provider = simple 
simple_allow_users = user1, user2

NOTES

The complete
group membership hierarchy is resolved before the access
check, thus even nested groups can be included in the access
lists. Please be aware that the
“ldap_group_nesting_level” option may impact the
results and should be set to a sufficient value.
(sssd-ldap(5)) option.
