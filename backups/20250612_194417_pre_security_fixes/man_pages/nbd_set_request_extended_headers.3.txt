NAME

nbd_set_request_extended_headers
- control use of extended headers

SYNOPSIS

#include

int nbd_set_request_extended_headers ( 
struct nbd_handle *h, bool request 
);

DESCRIPTION

By default,
libnbd tries to negotiate extended headers with the server,
as this protocol extension permits the use of 64-bit zero,
trim, and block status actions. However, for integration
testing, it can be useful to clear this flag rather than
find a way to alter the server to fail the negotiation
request.

For backwards
compatibility, the setting of this knob is ignored if
nbd_set_request_structured_replies(3) is also set to
false, since the use of extended headers implies structured
replies.

RETURN VALUE

If the call is
successful the function returns 0.

ERRORS

On error -1 is
returned.

Refer to
"ERROR HANDLING" in libnbd(3) for how to
get further details of the error.

The following
parameters must not be NULL: "h". For more
information see "Non-NULL parameters" in
libnbd(3).
