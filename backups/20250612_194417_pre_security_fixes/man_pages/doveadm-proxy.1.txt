Dovecot proxy connections.

OPTIONS

Global
doveadm(1) options:

-f formatter

Specifies the formatter
for formatting the output. Supported formatters are:

flow

pairs. 

pager

own line and separates records with form feed character
(^L). 

tab

prints a table header followed by tab separated value
lines. 

table

setting from /etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf and

override multiple settings, the -o option may be
specified multiple times.

-v

This command
uses by default the table output formatter.

Command
specific options: 
-a ipc_socket_path

This option is used to specify
an alternative socket. The option's argument is either an
absolute path to a local UNIX domain socket.

By default

another directory, when the default base_dir setting
was overridden in /etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf.

Depending on the configuration, a login name may be for
