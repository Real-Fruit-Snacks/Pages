NAME

approx-import -
copy local .deb files into the approx cache

SYNOPSIS

approx-import
[OPTION]... file.deb ...

DESCRIPTION

approx-import
copies local .deb files, such as those found in
/var/cache/apt/archives, into the approx(8)
cache.

It does so by
computing the MD5 checksum of each argument. If it matches a
package in one of the Packages files in the
approx(8) cache, then the file is copied to the
appropriate location in the cache.

Note that all
Packages files must be scanned, regardless of how
many .deb files are being imported, and this process may
take several minutes.

The
approx-import command must be run by the superuser or
the approx(8) user.

OPTIONS

-c file,
--config file

Specify an additional
configuration file. May be used multiple times.

-s,
--simulate

Process files but do not
actually copy them into the cache.

-q, --quiet

Don’t print the names of
files that are imported.

-v, --verbose

Print the disposition of each
file.

EXAMPLES

To import
packages from the local apt(8) cache:

approx-import
/var/cache/apt/archives/*.deb

To import
packages from another proxy’s cache:

find
other-cache -name "*.deb" | xargs
approx-import

(where
other-cache is the pathname of the other
proxy’s cache directory)

FILES

/etc/approx/approx.conf

Configuration file for
approx and related programs.

/var/cache/approx

Default cache directory for
archive files.
