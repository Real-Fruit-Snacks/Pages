NAME

ccsd - The
daemon used to access CCS cluster configuration files.

SYNOPSIS

ccsd
[OPTION]..

DESCRIPTION

ccsd is
part of the Cluster Configuration System (CCS). It is the
daemon which accesses cluster the configuration file for
other cluster applications. It must be run on each node that
wishes to join a cluster.

OPTIONS

-4

Use IPv4 for inter-node
communication. By default, IPv6 is tried, then IPv4.

-6

Use IPv6 for inter-node communication. By default, IPv6
is tried, then IPv4.

-I

Force use of IP for local communication (disables use of
UNIX domain sockets). If set, ccsd will use the
specified inter-node communication protocol (see the
-4 and -6 options). If one is not specified,
IPv6 is tried, then IPv4. For backward compatibility, IP
connections are still allowed even when UNIX domain sockets
are available.

-h

Help. Print out the usage syntax.

-m 

Used to specify the multicast
address. The keyword "default" can be used, in
which case "ff02::3:1" is used for IPv6 and
"224.0.2.5" is used for IPv4.

If you are
using IPv4, the default action is to use broadcast.
Specifying this option will cause multicast to be used in
that instance.

-n

No daemon. Run in the foreground.

-P :

You have the option of
specifying the port numbers used by ccsd. The port
identifier is either: b, c, or f. "b" is the port
which ccsd attempts to communicate with ccsd processes on
other machines, via broadcast/multicast, to obtain or
validate its config file (cluster.conf). This is known as
the backend port. "c" is the base port number of
two consecutive ports used by ccsd processes to communicate
cluster membership information. This is known as the cluster
base port. "f" is the port number that listens for
information requests from the CCS library (or programs using
it). This is known as the frontend port.

So, to change
the frontend port one might specify -P f:60000.

-t 

Set the multicast threshold
(aka time to live).

-V

Print the version information.
