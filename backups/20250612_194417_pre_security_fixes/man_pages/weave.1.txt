NAME

weave -
translate WEB to TeX

SYNOPSIS

weave
[-p] [-x] webfile[.web]
[{changefile[.ch]|-}
[outfile[.tex]]]

DESCRIPTION

This manual
page is not meant to be exhaustive. The complete
documentation for this version of TeX can be found in the
info file or manual Web2C: A TeX implementation.

The
weave program is used to create a TeX file for
viewing a Web program. It takes appropriate care of
typographic details like page layout and the use of
indentation, italics, boldface, etc., and it supplies
extensive cross-index information that it gathers
automatically. The command line arguments are the same as
for tangle except for the options: -p says to
use alternative macros more suited for PDF output. -x
says to omit the index, module name list, and table of
contents pages. (A CONTENTS.tex file will still be
written when the TeX file is processed, however, unless some
macros in webmac.tex are redefined.)

The output TeX
file name is formed by adding .tex to the root of the
Web file name or from the third argument. In this case you
can specify ’-’ as an empty change file.

There are
several macros that probably should be redefined by the
programmer at the beginning of the Web file. It is a good
idea to set \title to the name of the program. And, to cause
output of only changed modules, one can say
\let\maybe=\iffalse (usually as the first change in the
change file).

ENVIRONMENT

The environment
variable WEBINPUTS is used to search for the input files, or
the system default if WEBINPUTS is not set. See
tex(1) for the details of the searching.
