NAME

ld.hugetlbfs -
link a program for huge pages

SYNOPSIS

ld.hugetlbfs
[options]

DESCRIPTION

ld.hugetlbfs
replaces the normal ld command for linking programs
to use hugepages. Under gcc, you should use the option -B
/usr/share/libhugetlbfs which tells gcc to look in a
non-standard location for the linker. This could be set in
the CFLAGS environment variable. 
-Wl,--hugetlbfs-align

This method of
linking an application permits greater flexibility at
runtime. Using HUGETLB_ELFMAP, it is possible to control
which program segments are placed in hugepages. The
following four settings will cause the indicated segments to
be placed in hugepages:

HUGETLB_ELFMAP=R
Read-only segments (text) 
HUGETLB_ELFMAP=W Writable segments (data/BSS) 
HUGETLB_ELFMAP=RW All segments (text/data/BSS) 
HUGETLB_ELFMAP=no No segments

It is possible
to select specific huge page sizes for read-only and
writable segments by using the following advanced
syntax:

HUGETLB_ELFMAP=[R[=]:[W[=]]

-Wl,--hugetlbfs-link=B

Under binutils
2.16 or older, this option will link the application to
store BSS data (only) into hugepages.

-Wl,--hugetlbfs-link=BDT

Under binutils
2.16 or older, this option will link the application to
store text, initialized data and BSS data into
hugepages.
