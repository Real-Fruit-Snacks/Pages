AGE(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual AGE(4)

NAME

age —
Attansic/Atheros L1 Gigabit Ethernet driver

SYNOPSIS

To compile this driver into the
kernel, place the following lines in your kernel
configuration file:

device
miibus 
device age

Alternatively,
to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following line in loader.conf(5):

if_age_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION

The age device driver
provides support for Attansic/Atheros L1 PCI Express Gigabit
Ethernet controllers.

All LOMs
supported by the age driver have TCP/UDP/IP checksum
offload for both transmit and receive, TCP segmentation
offload (TSO), hardware VLAN tag stripping/insertion
features and an interrupt moderation mechanism as well as a
64-bit multicast hash filter.

The L1 also
supports Jumbo Frames (up to 10240 bytes), which can be
configured via the interface MTU setting. Selecting an MTU
larger than 1500 bytes with the ifconfig(8) utility
configures the adapter to receive and transmit Jumbo
Frames.

The age
driver supports the following media types:

autoselect

Enable
autoselection of the media type and options. The user can
manually override the autoselected mode by adding media
options to rc.conf(5).

10baseT/UTP

Set 10Mbps
operation.

100baseTX

Set 100Mbps
(Fast Ethernet) operation.

1000baseTX

Set 1000baseTX
operation over twisted pair.

The age
driver supports the following media options:

full-duplex

Force full
duplex operation.

half-duplex

Force half
duplex operation.

For more
information on configuring this device, see ifconfig(8).

LOADER TUNABLES

Tunables can be set at the
loader(8) prompt before booting the kernel or stored in
loader.conf(5).

hw.age.msi_disable

This tunable disables MSI
support on the Ethernet hardware. The default value is
0.

hw.age.msix_disable

This tunable disables MSI-X
support on the Ethernet hardware. The default value is
0.

SYSCTL VARIABLES

The following variables are
available as both sysctl(8) variables and loader(8)
tunables:

dev.age.%d.int_mod

Maximum amount of time to delay
interrupt processing in units of 2us. The accepted range is
0 to 65000, the default is 50 (100us). Value 0 completely
disables the interrupt moderation.

dev.age.%d.process_limit

Maximum amount of Rx events to
be processed in the event loop before rescheduling a
taskqueue. The accepted range is 30 to 255, the default
value is 128 events. The interface does not need to be
brought down and up again before a change takes effect.

dev.age.%d.stats

Display lots of useful MAC
counters maintained in the driver.
