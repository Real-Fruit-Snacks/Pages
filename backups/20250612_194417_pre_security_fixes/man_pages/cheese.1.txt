NAME

cheese - tool
to take pictures and videos from your webcam

SYNOPSIS

cheese [option...]

DESCRIPTION

cheese
uses your webcam to take photos and videos, applies fancy
special effects and lets you share the fun with others. It
was written as part of Google's 2007 Summer of Code lead by
daniel g. siegel and mentored by RaphaÃ«l Slinckx. Under
the hood, Cheese uses GStreamer to apply fancy effects to
photos and videos. With Cheese it is easy to take photos of
you, your friends, pets or whatever you want and share them
with others. After the success of the Summer of Code, the
development continued and we are still looking for people
with nice ideas and patches ;)
