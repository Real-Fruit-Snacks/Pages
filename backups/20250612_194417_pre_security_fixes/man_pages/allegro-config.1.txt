NAME

allegro-config
- script to get information about the installed version of
Allegro

SYNOPSIS

allegro-config
[--prefix[=DIR]] [--exec-prefix[=DIR]]
[--version] [--libs] [--cflags] [--static] [--shared]
[--env] [release|debug|profile]

DESCRIPTION

allegro-config
is a tool that is used to configure to determine the
compiler and linker flags that should be used to compile and
link programs that use the Allegro library. It is
intended to be used on Unix systems instead of the simple
"-lalleg" call.

EXAMPLE

gcc -o
mygame mygame.o ’allegro-config --libs’

allegro-config
will insert arguments needed to link into the command
line.

OPTIONS

allegro-config
accepts the following options: 
--version

Print the currently installed
version of Allegro on the standard output.

--libs

Print the linker flags that are necessary to link an
Allegro program.

--cflags

Print the compiler flags that
are necessary to compile an Allegro program.

--prefix=PREFIX

If specified, use PREFIX
instead of the installation prefix that Allegro was
built with when computing the output for the --cflags and
--libs options. This option is also used for the exec prefix
if --exec-prefix was not specified. This option must be
specified before any --libs or --cflags options.

--exec-prefix=PREFIX

If specified, use PREFIX
instead of the installation exec prefix that Allegro
was built with when computing the output for the --cflags
and --libs options. This option must be specified before any
--libs or --cflags options.

--static

Like --libs, but always print
the linker flags needed to get a statically linked
executable.

--shared

Like --libs, but always print
the linker flags needed to get an executable linked against
shared libs.

--env

Print some needed environment variables in the way
needed in shell scripts. Output may be loaded into your
environment using

BASH#> eval `allegro-config --env’

release

This will use the optimized
Allegro library which you should use when you are compiling
for a release.

debug

This will add extra debug info into your programs,
useful to find out where your program crashed or simply to
debug it (names of functions are seen). You may choose this
option while developing a program.

profile

This may be used when you want to profile your program -
i.e. measure the speeds of various function calls.
