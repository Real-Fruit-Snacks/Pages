NAME

groupadd
− add (create) a new group definition on the
system

SYNOPSIS

/usr/sbin/groupadd
[ -g gid [-o]] group

DESCRIPTION

The
groupadd command creates a new group definition on
the system by adding the appropriate entry to the
/etc/group file.

OPTIONS

The following
options are supported: 
-g gid

Assigns the group id gid
for the new group. This group id must be a non-negative
decimal integer below MAXUID as defined in
/usr/include/sys/param.h. The group ID
defaults to the next available (unique) number above the
highest number currently assigned. For example, if groups
100, 105, and 200 are assigned as
groups, the next default group number will be 201.
(Group IDs from 0−99 are reserved
by SunOS for future applications.)

-o

Allows the gid to be duplicated (non-unique).

OPERANDS

The following
operands are supported:

group

A string consisting of
characters from the set of lower case alphabetic characters
and numeric characters. A warning message will be written if
the string exceeds MAXGLEN, which is usually set at
eight characters. The group field must contain at
least one character; it accepts lower case or numeric
characters or a combination of both, and must not contain a
colon (:) or NEWLINE.

EXIT STATUS

The following
exit values are returned:

0

Successful completion.

2

Invalid command syntax. A usage message for the
groupadd command is displayed.

3

An invalid argument was provided to an option.

4

The gid is not unique (when -o option is
not used).

9

The group is not unique.

10

The /etc/group file cannot be updated.

NOTES

groupadd
only adds a group definition to the local system. If a
network name service such as NIS or NIS+ is
being used to supplement the local /etc/group file
with additional entries, groupadd cannot change
information supplied by the network name service. However,
groupadd will verify the uniqueness of group name and
group ID against the external name service.
