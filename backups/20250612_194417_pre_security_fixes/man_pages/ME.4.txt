ME(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual ME(4)

NAME

me â€” encapsulating
network device

SYNOPSIS

To compile the driver into the
kernel, place the following line in the kernel configuration
file:

device
me

Alternatively,
to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following line in loader.conf(5):

if_me_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION

The me network interface
pseudo device encapsulates datagrams into IP. These
encapsulated datagrams are routed to a destination host,
where they are decapsulated and further routed to their
final destination.

me
interfaces are dynamically created and destroyed with the
ifconfig(8) create and destroy
subcommands.

This driver
corresponds to RFC 2004. Datagrams are encapsulated into IP
with a shorter encapsulation. The original IP header is
modified and the modifications are inserted between the so
modified header and the original payload. The protocol
number 55 is used for outer header.

NOTES

For correct operation, the
me device needs a route to the decapsulating host
that does not run over the tunnel, as this would be a
loop.
