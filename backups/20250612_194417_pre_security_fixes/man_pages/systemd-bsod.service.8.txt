NAME

systemd-bsod.service,
systemd-bsod - Displays boot-time emergency log message in
full screen

SYNOPSIS

systemd-bsod.service

/usr/lib/systemd/systemd-bsod
[OPTIONS...] 

DESCRIPTION

systemd-bsod.service
is used to display a blue screen which contains a message
relating to a boot failure, including a QR code which can be
scanned to get helpful information about the failure.

OPTIONS

The following
options are understood by systemd-bsod:

-h,
--help

Print a short help text and
exit.

--version

Print a short version string
and exit.

-c,
--continuous

When specified,
systemd-bsod waits continuously for changes in the
journal if it doesn't find any emergency messages on the
initial attempt.

Added in
version 255.

--tty=

Specify the TTY to output to.
By default systemd-bsod will automatically find a
free VT to display the message on. If this option is
specified a TTY may be selected explicitly. Use
--tty=/dev/tty to direct output to the terminal the
command is invoked on.

Added in
version 256.

EXIT STATUS

On success
(displaying the journal message successfully), 0 is
returned, a non-zero failure code otherwise.
