NAME

sendfiles -
send multiple files by MIME message with nmh

SYNOPSIS

sendfiles

[-help] [-version]
[-compress bzip2 | compress |
gzip | lzma

| none]

[-from sender]

-to recipient -subject subject |
recipient subject 
file/directory1 [file/directory2 ...]

DESCRIPTION

The shell
script sendfiles is used to send a collection of
files and directories via electronic mail.

sendfiles
will archive the files and directories you name with the
tar command, and then mail the compressed archive to
the “recipient” with the given
“subject”.

The -to
switch specifies the recipient. The -subject switch
specifies the subject. Alternatively, these two required
values can be provided without their corresponding switch
names.

The
-from switch can, and should, be used to specify the
sender’s mailbox (name and email address).
Alternatively, the PERSON environment variable can be
used for the same purpose. If neither is used,
sendfiles will supply a “From:” header
field using the sender’s local mailbox, see
localmbox in mh-format(5).

The
-compress command line switch can be used to override
the run-time determination of the compression program by
sendfiles. -compress none
(alternatively, -none) disables compression.

Extracting
the Received Files 
When the message is received, invoke mhstore once for
the received message. The default is for mhstore to
write the archive to a file where you can subsequently
uncompress and untar it. For instance:

$ mhlist
-verbose 9 
msg part type/subtype size description 
9 application/octet-stream 118K 
(extract with uncompress | tar xvpf -) 
type=tar 
conversions=compress 
$ mhstore 9 
$ uncompress 

Alternately, by
using the -auto switch, mhstore will
automatically do the extraction for you:

$ mhlist
-verbose 9 
msg part type/subtype size description 
9 application/octet-stream 118K 
(extract with uncompress | tar xvpf -) 
type=tar 
conversions=compress 
$ mhstore -auto 9 
-- tar listing appears here as files are extracted

As the second
tar listing is generated, the files are extracted. A
prudent user will never put -auto in the
.mh_profile file. The correct procedure is to first
use mhlist to find out what will be extracted. Then
mhstore can be invoked with -auto to perform
the extraction.
