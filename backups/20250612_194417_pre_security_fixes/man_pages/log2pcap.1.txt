NAME

log2pcap -
Extract network traces from Samba log files

SYNOPSIS

log2pcap [-h] [-q] [logfile]
[pcap_file] 

DESCRIPTION

This tool is
part of the samba(7) suite.

log2pcap reads
in a samba log file and generates a pcap file (readable by
most sniffers, such as ethereal or tcpdump) based on the
packet dumps in the log file.

The log file
must have a log level of at least 5 to get the
SMB header/parameters right, 10 to get the first 512
data bytes of the packet and 50 to get the whole
packet.

OPTIONS

-h

If this parameter is specified
the output file will be a hex dump, in a format that is
readable by the text2pcap utility.

-q

Be quiet. No warning messages
about missing or incomplete data will be given.

logfile

Samba log file. log2pcap will
try to read the log from stdin if the log file is not
specified.

pcap_file

Name of the output file to
write the pcap (or hexdump) data to. If this argument is not
specified, output data will be written to stdout.

-?|--help

Print a summary of command line
options.

EXAMPLES

Extract all
network traffic from all samba log files:

$ log2pcap  trace.pcap

Convert to pcap
using text2pcap:

$ log2pcap -h
samba.log | text2pcap -T 139,139 - trace.pcap

VERSION

This man page
is part of version 4.20.2-Debian-4.20.2+dfsg-10 of the Samba
suite.

BUGS

Only SMB data
is extracted from the samba logs, no LDAP, NetBIOS lookup or
other data.

The generated
TCP and IP headers don't contain a valid checksum.

Open Source project similar to the way the Linux kernel is
developed.
