BUILD(7) BSD Miscellaneous Information Manual
BUILD(7)

NAME

build — information
on how to build the system

DESCRIPTION

The source for the FreeBSD
system and applications are contained in three different
directories, normally /usr/src, /usr/doc, and
/usr/ports. /usr/src contains the
’’base system’’ sources, which is
loosely defined as the things required to rebuild the system
to a useful state. /usr/doc contains the source for
the system documentation, excluding the manual pages.
/usr/ports is a tree that provides a consistent
interface for building and installing third party
applications.

The make(1)
command is used in each of these directories to build and
install the things in that directory. Issuing the make(1)
command in any directory or subdirectory of those
directories has the same effect as issuing the same command
in all subdirectories of that directory. With no target
specified, the things in that directory are just built. The
following list provides the names and actions for other
targets:

clean

Removes any
files created during the build process.

install

Installs the
results of the build for this directory.

update

Gets updated
sources as configured in /etc/make.conf.

The other
/usr/src make targets are:

buildworld

Rebuild
everything but the kernel, configure files in /etc,
and release.

installworld

Install everything built by
buildworld.

buildkernel

Rebuild the kernel and the
kernel modules.

installkernel

Install the kernel and the
kernel modules.

reinstallkernel

Reinstall the kernel and the
kernel modules.

For more
information about the ports build process, see ports(7).

ENVIRONMENT 
TARGET_ARCH

The target
machine processor architecture. This is analogous to the
’’uname −p’’ output.
Set this to cross-build for a different architecture.

TARGET

The target
hardware platform. This is analogous to the
’’uname −m’’ output.
This is necessary to cross-build some target architectures.
For example, cross-building for PC98 machines requires
TARGET_ARCH=i386 and TARGET=pc98.

NO_WERROR

If defined,
warnings will not cause the build to halt, even if the
makefile says otherwise.

DESTDIR

The directory
hierarchy where the resulting binaries will be
installed.

FILES 
/etc/make.conf 
/usr/doc/Makefile 
/usr/doc/share/mk/doc.project.mk 
/usr/ports/Mk/bsd.port.mk 
/usr/ports/Mk/bsd.sites.mk 
/usr/share/examples/etc/make.conf 
/usr/src/Makefile 
/usr/src/Makefile.inc1 
EXAMPLES

For an
’’approved’’ method of updating your
system from the latest sources, please see the COMMON
ITEMS section in src/UPDATING.

The following
sequence of commands can be used to cross-build the system
for the Alpha architecture on an i386 host:

cd /usr/src

make TARGET_ARCH=alpha buildworld 
make TARGET_ARCH=alpha DESTDIR=/clients/axp installworld
