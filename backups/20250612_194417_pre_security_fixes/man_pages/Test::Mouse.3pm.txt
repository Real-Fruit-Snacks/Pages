NAME
       Test::Mouse - Test functions for Mouse specific features

SYNOPSIS
         use Test::More plan => 1;
         use Test::Mouse;

         meta_ok($class_or_obj, "... Foo has a ->meta");
         does_ok($class_or_obj, $role, "... Foo does the Baz role");
         has_attribute_ok($class_or_obj, $attr_name, "... Foo has the 'bar' attribute");

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides some useful test functions for Mouse based
       classes. It is an experimental first release, so comments and
       suggestions are very welcome.

EXPORTED FUNCTIONS
       meta_ok ($class_or_object)
           Tests if a class or object has a metaclass.

       does_ok ($class_or_object, $role, ?$message)
           Tests if a class or object does a certain role, similar to what
           "isa_ok" does for the "isa" method.

       has_attribute_ok($class_or_object, $attr_name, ?$message)
           Tests if a class or object has a certain attribute, similar to what
           "can_ok" does for the methods.

       with_immutable { CODE } @class_names
           Runs CODE *which should contain normal tests) twice, and make each
           class in @class_names immutable between the two runs.
