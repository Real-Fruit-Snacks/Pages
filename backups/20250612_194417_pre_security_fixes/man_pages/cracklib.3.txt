NAME

FascistCheck -
a pro-active password checker library

SYNOPSIS

#include

static char
const CRACKLIB_DICTPATH[] =  ...;

extern char
const * 
FascistCheck(char const passwd[], char const
dictpath[]);

DESCRIPTION

cracklib is a
library containing the FascistCheck C function which
may be used in a "passwd" like program. The idea
is simple: try to prevent users from choosing passwords that
could be guessed by "crack" by filtering them out,
at source. cracklib is an offshoot of the the version 5 of
the "crack" software and contains a considerable
number of ideas nicked from the new software.

The first
formal argument password is the potential password.
The second formal argument dictpath is the full path
name + filename prefix of the cracklib dictionary database.
FascistCheck returns the NULL pointer for a good
password, or a pointer to a diagnostic string if it is a
weak password.

The database is
in a binary format generated by the utilities
crack_mkdict(8) and crack_packer(8). On a
Debian system the database is located in the directory
defined by the static constant CRACKLIB_DICTPATH and
is set to /var/cache/cracklib/cracklib_dict. None of the
subroutines in the cracklib libraries have this location
hard-coded into their implementations. It is generated daily
with the program /etc/cron.daily/cracklib.
