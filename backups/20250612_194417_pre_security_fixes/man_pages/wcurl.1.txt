NAME

wcurl -
a simple wrapper around curl to easily download files.

SYNOPSIS

wcurl
[--curl-options ]...
[--dry-run] [--] ... 
wcurl [--curl-options=]...
[--dry-run] [--] ... 
wcurl -V|--version 
wcurl -h|--help

DESCRIPTION

wcurl is
a simple curl wrapper which lets you use curl to download
files without having to remember any parameters.

Simply call
wcurl with a list of URLs you want to download and
wcurl will pick sane defaults.

If you need
anything more complex, you can provide any of curl’s
supported parameters via the --curl-options option.
Just beware that you likely should be using curl directly if
your use case is not covered. 
By default, wcurl will:

• Encode whitespaces in
URLs; 
• Download multiple URLs in parallel if the installed
curl’s version is >= 7.66.0; 
• Follow redirects; 
• Automatically choose a filename as output; 
• Avoid overwriting files if the installed curl’s
version is >= 7.83.0 (--no-clobber); 
• Perform retries; 
• Set the downloaded file timestamp to the value
provided by the server, if available; 
• Default to the protocol used as https if the URL
doesn’t contain any. 
• Disable curl’s URL globbing parser so
{} and [] characters in URLs are not treated
specially.

OPTIONS

--curl-options,
--curl-options=...

Specify extra options to be
passed when invoking curl. May be specified more than
once.

--dry-run

Don’t actually execute
curl, just print what would be invoked.

-V, --version

Print version information.

-h, --help

Print help message.

CURL_OPTIONS

Any option
supported by curl can be set here. This is not used by
wcurl; it’s instead forwarded to the curl
invocation.

URL

Anything which
is not a parameter will be considered an URL. wcurl
will encode whitespaces and pass that to curl, which will
perform the parsing of the URL.

EXAMPLES

Download a
single file: 
wcurl example.com/filename.txt

Download two
files in parallel: 
wcurl example.com/filename1.txt
example.com/filename2.txt

Download a file
passing the --progress-bar and --http2 flags
to curl: 
wcurl --curl-options="--progress-bar --http2"
example.com/filename.txt

Resume from an
interrupted download (if more options are used, this needs
to be the last one in the list): 
wcurl --curl-options="--continue-at -"
example.com/filename.txt
