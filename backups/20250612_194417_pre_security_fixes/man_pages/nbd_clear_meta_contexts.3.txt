NAME

nbd_clear_meta_contexts
- reset the list of requested meta contexts

SYNOPSIS

#include

int nbd_clear_meta_contexts ( 
struct nbd_handle *h 
);

DESCRIPTION

During
connection libnbd can negotiate zero or more metadata
contexts with the server. Metadata contexts are features
(such as "base:allocation") which describe
information returned by the nbd_block_status_64(3)
command (for "base:allocation" this is whether
blocks of data are allocated, zero or sparse).

This command
resets the list of meta contexts to request back to an empty
list, for re-population by further use of
nbd_add_meta_context(3). It is primarily useful when
option negotiation mode is selected (see
nbd_set_opt_mode(3)), for altering the list of
attempted contexts between subsequent export queries.

RETURN VALUE

If the call is
successful the function returns 0.

ERRORS

On error -1 is
returned.

Refer to
"ERROR HANDLING" in libnbd(3) for how to
get further details of the error.

The following
parameters must not be NULL: "h". For more
information see "Non-NULL parameters" in
libnbd(3).
