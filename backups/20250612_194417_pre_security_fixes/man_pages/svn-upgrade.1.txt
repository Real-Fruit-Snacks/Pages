NAME

svn-upgrade
− upgrade source package from a new upstream
revision

SYNOPSIS

svn−upgrade newsource
[options] 

DESCRIPTION

svn−upgrade
modifies a Debian package source located in a Subversion
repository, upgrading it to a new upstream release. The
repository filesystem tree must be in the format created by
svn−inject.

OPTIONS

svn−upgrade
accepts the following options on the command−line:

−V
STRING | −−version STRING

Forces a different upstream
version string

Default:
Off.

−c
| −−clean

Runs make clean and
removes the debian/ directory in the new source.

Default:
Off.

STRING | −−packagename STRING

Forces a different package
name

Default:
Off.

−v
| −−verbose

More verbose program output

Default:

−r

conflicting files with upstream versions. Review of svn
status output before doing that could make sense.

Default:

changelog entry.

the changelog entry.

−u
| −−uscan

Use uscan to download
the new version.

STRING

Make files that are ignored due
to subversion ignore patterns to be 'import'ed or
'skip'ed.

−e

epoch if the new upstream version is not greater than the
current.

merging the new upstream source.
