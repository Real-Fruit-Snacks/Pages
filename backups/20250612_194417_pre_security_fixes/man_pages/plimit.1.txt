NAME

plimit âˆ’
get or set the resource limits of running processes

SYNOPSIS

plimit
[-km] pid...

plimit
{-cdfnstv} soft,hard... pid...

DESCRIPTION

If one or more
of the cdfnstv options is specified, plimit
sets the soft (current) limit and/or the hard (maximum)
limit of the indicated resource(s) in the processes
identified by the process-ID list, pid. Otherwise
plimit reports the resource limits of the processes
identified by the process-ID list, pid.

Only the owner
of a process or the super-user is permitted either to get or
to set the resource limits of a process. Only the super-user
can increase the hard limit.

OPTIONS

The following
options are supported:

-k

On output, show file sizes in kilobytes (1024 bytes)
rather than in 512-byte blocks.

-m

On output, show file and memory sizes in megabytes
(1024*1024 bytes).

The remainder
of the options are used to change specified resource limits.
They each accept an argument of the form:

soft,hard

where
soft specifies the soft (current) limit and
hard specifies the hard (maximum) limit. If the hard
limit is not specified, the comma may be omitted. If the
soft limit is an empty string, only the hard limit is set.
Each limit is either the literal string unlimited, or
a number, with an optional scaling factor, as follows:

nk

n kilobytes

nm

n megabytes (minutes for CPU time)

nh

n hours (for CPU time only)

mm:ss

minutes and seconds (for CPU time only)

The soft limit
cannot exceed the hard limit. 
-c soft,hard

Set core file size limits
(default unit is 512-byte blocks).

-d soft,hard

Set data segment (heap) size
limits (default unit is kilobytes).

-f soft,hard

Set file size limits (default
unit is 512-byte blocks).

-n soft,hard

Set file descriptor limits (no
default unit).

-s soft,hard

Set stack segment size limits
(default unit is kilobytes).

-t soft,hard

Set CPU time limits (default
unit is seconds).

-v soft,hard

Set virtual memory size limits
(default unit is kilobytes).

OPERANDS

The following
operands are supported.

pid

Process ID list.

EXIT STATUS

plimit
returns the exit value zero on success, non-zero on failure
(such as no such process, permission denied, or invalid
option).

FILES

/proc/pid/*

process information and control
files
