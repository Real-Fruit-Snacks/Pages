ACPIDUMP(8)

NAME

acpidump — dump
ACPI tables and ASL

SYNOPSIS

acpidump
[−d] [−t] [−h]
[−v] [−f dsdt_input]
[−o dsdt_output]

DESCRIPTION

The acpidump utility
analyzes ACPI tables in physical memory and can dump them to
a file. In addition, acpidump can call iasl(8) to
disassemble AML (ACPI Machine Language) found in these
tables and dump them as ASL (ACPI Source Language) to
stdout.

ACPI tables have
an essential data block (the DSDT, Differentiated System
Description Table) that includes information used on the
kernel side such as detailed information about PnP hardware,
procedures for controlling power management support, and so
on. The acpidump utility can extract the DSDT data
block from physical memory and store it into an output file
and optionally also disassemble it. If any Secondary System
Description Table (SSDT) entries exist, they will also be
included in the output file and disassembly.

When
acpidump is invoked without the −f
option, it will read ACPI tables from physical memory via
/dev/mem. First it searches for the RSDP (Root System
Description Pointer), which has the signature "RSD
PTR ", and then gets the RSDT (Root System
Description Table), which includes a list of pointers to
physical memory addresses for other tables. The RSDT itself
and all other tables linked from RSDT are generically called
SDTs (System Description Tables) and their header has a
common format which consists of items such as Signature,
Length, Revision, Checksum, OEMID, OEM Table ID, OEM
Revision, Creator ID and Creator Revision. When invoked with
the −t flag, the acpidump utility dumps
contents of the following tables:

DSDT 
ECDT 
FACS 
FADT 
HPET 
MADT 
RSD PTR 
RSDT

The RSDT contains a pointer to
the physical memory address of the FACP (Fixed ACPI
Description Table). The FACP defines static system
information about power management support (ACPI Hardware
Register Implementation) such as interrupt mode (INT_MODEL),
SCI interrupt number, SMI command port (SMI_CMD) and the
location of ACPI registers. The FACP also has a pointer to a
physical memory address for the DSDT. While the other tables
are fixed format, the DSDT consists of free-formatted AML
data.

OPTIONS

The following options are
supported by acpidump:

−d

Disassemble the
DSDT into ASL using iasl(8) and print the results to
stdout.

−t

Dump the
contents of the various fixed tables listed above.

−h

Displays usage
and exit.

−v

Enable verbose
messages.

−f
dsdt_input

Load the DSDT from the
specified file instead of physical memory. Since only the
DSDT is stored in the file, the −t flag may not
be used with this option.

−o
dsdt_output

Store the DSDT data block from
physical memory into the specified file.

EXAMPLES

This example dumps the DSDT from
physical memory to foo.dsdt. It also prints the contents of
various system tables and disassembles the AML contained in
the DSDT to stdout, redirecting the output to foo.asl.

# acpidump -t
-d -o foo.dsdt > foo.asl

This example
reads a DSDT file and disassembles it to stdout. Verbose
messages are enabled.

# acpidump -v
-d -f foo.dsdt

BUGS

The current implementation does
not dump the BOOT structure or other miscellaneous
tables.

iasl(8) for FreeBSD 5.2.
