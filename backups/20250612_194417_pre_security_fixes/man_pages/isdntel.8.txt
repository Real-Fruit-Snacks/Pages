NAME

isdntel — isdn4bsd
telephone answering management utility

SYNOPSIS

isdntel
[−a aliasfile]
[−d spooldir]
[−p playcommand]
[−t timeout]

DESCRIPTION

The isdntel utility is
used to provide an "answering machine"
functionality for incoming telephone voice messages.

The following
options are supported:

−a

Use
aliasfile as the pathname for an aliasfile containing
aliases for phone numbers. The default path is
/etc/isdn/isdntel.alias. The format of an alias entry
is the number string followed by one or more spaces or tabs.
The rest of the line is taken as the alias string. Comments
are introduced by a leading blank, tab or "#"
character.

−d

Use
spooldir as the directory where the incoming voice
messages are stored by the "answ" script called by
isdnd(8). This defaults to the directory /var/isdn.
The format of a voice message filename is:

YYMMDDhhmmss-dest_number-source_number-length_in_secs

−p

Use
playcommand as the command string to execute for
playing a voice message to some audio output facility. The
characters %s are replaced by the currently selected
filename. The default string is ’’cat %s |
alaw2ulaw >/dev/audio’’.

−t

The value for
timeout specifies the time in seconds the program
rereads the spool directory when there is no keyboard
activity.

The screen
output should be obvious. If in doubt, consult the
source.
