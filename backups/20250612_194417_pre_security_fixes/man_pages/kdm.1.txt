NAME

kdm − KDE
Display Manager

SYNOPSIS

kdm
[options] [tty]

DESCRIPTION

kdm is
the KDE display manager also known as login manager. It
shows a graphical login screen for username and password.
After authenticating the user it starts a session. 
kdm can be configured for remote login via XDMCP. XDMCP
is the "X Display Manager Control Protocol" which
is used to set up connections between remote systems over
the network.

kdm is a
derivative of xdm. man 1 xdm may provide
useful information (requires installed xdm). For
X-related problems try man 7x X and man 1
startx.
