NAME

nbdkit-tls-fallback-filter
- nbdkit TLS protection filter

SYNOPSIS

nbdkit --tls=on
--filter=tls-fallback plugin [plugin-args...] 
[tlsreadme=MESSAGE]

DESCRIPTION

"nbdkit-tls-fallback-filter"
is designed to be used when offering a connection that
allows but does not require TLS from clients, in order to
offer safe alternative content to plaintext clients, only
exposing the underlying plugin to authenticated users. This
may provide a nicer failure mode for plaintext clients than
the harsher "nbdkit --tls=require".

When this
filter detects a plaintext connection, it ignores the
client’s export name, and provides a single read-only
export with 512 bytes of data and content that defaults to
the message "This NBD server requires TLS
authentication before it will serve useful data."

When using this
filter, it is recommended to place this filter first in the
command line, to reduce the chance that any work done by
".open" in earlier filters can be exploited by
plaintext connections as a denial of service attack to
starve further authenticated connections. Note that this
filter will fail to load if the plugin requests the
"SERIALIZE_CONNECTIONS" thread model, as a
plaintext client holding its connection open indefinitely
would be such a starvation.

PARAMETERS

tlsreadme=MESSAGE

This optional parameter can be
used to use "MESSAGE" as the contents of the dummy
export exposed to plaintext clients, using trailing NUL
bytes to round the size up to 512 bytes.
