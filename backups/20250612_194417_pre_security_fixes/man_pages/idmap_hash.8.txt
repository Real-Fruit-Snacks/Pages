NAME

idmap_hash - DO
NOT USE THIS BACKEND

DESCRIPTION

DO NOT USE THIS
PLUGIN The idmap_hash plugin implements a hashing algorithm
used to map SIDs for domain users and groups to 31-bit uids
and gids, respectively. This plugin also implements the
nss_info API and can be used to support a local name mapping
files if enabled via the "winbind normalize names"
and "winbind nss info" parameters in
/etc/samba/smb.conf. The module divides the range into
subranges for each domain that is being handled by the idmap
config. The module needs the complete UID and GID range to
be able to map all SIDs. The lowest value for the range
should be the smallest ID available in the system. This is
normally 1000. The highest ID should be set to 2147483647. A
smaller range will lead to issues because of the hashing
algorithm used. The overall range to map all SIDs is 0 -
2147483647. Any range smaller than 0 - 2147483647 will
filter some SIDs. As we can normally only start with 1000,
we are not able to map 1000 SIDs. This already can lead to
issues. The smaller the range the less SIDs can be mapped.
We do not recommend to use this plugin. It will be removed
in a future release of Samba.

IDMAP OPTIONS

name_map

Specifies the absolute path to
the name mapping file used by the nss_info API. Entries in
the file are of the form "unix name =
qualified domain name". Mapping of both user and
group names is supported.

EXAMPLES

The following
example utilizes the idmap_hash plugin for the idmap and
nss_info information.

[global]

idmap config * : backend = hash

idmap config * : range = 1000-2147483647

winbind nss info = hash

winbind normalize names = yes

idmap_hash:name_map = /etc/samba/name_map.cfg
