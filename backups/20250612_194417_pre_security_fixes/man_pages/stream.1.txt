NAME

stream âˆ’
captures an audio and (multiple) video stream(s)

SYNOPSIS

stream
[options] streams...

DESCRIPTION

Vstream is a
collection of utilities for capturing reasonably high
quality video from a v4l device (specifically configured for
bttv). A simultaneous audio track is also captured.

The first
utility - stream - captures an audio and (multiple)
video stream(s). For highest performance, the video stream
should be written to a raw partition(s).

OPTIONS

-half

only capture 1 of every 2 frames
- reduces required bandwidth with little visible loss in
quality (in my opinion).

-halfx Xxdim Xydim

capture half the frames to disk
and half to an X window of width Xxdim and height Xydim (see
BUGS).

-start time

the next argument, in the form
hh:mm:ss:dd:mm:yyyy, is the time at which recording will
start. Only the first three arguments are required. The
remaining arguments will be taken from the current
date/time.

-end time

time to stop recording. Same
format as "-start".

xdim

width

ydim

height

streams...

One audio stream and max. 256
video streams are possible. Both types of the arguments are
simply a file name (should be an empty file or a raw
partition), the first argument will be the audio stream, the
other will be video streams.
