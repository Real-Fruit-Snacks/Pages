NAME

sq key userid
revoke - Revoke a User ID

SYNOPSIS

sq key
userid revoke [OPTIONS] USERID REASON
MESSAGE

DESCRIPTION

Revoke a User
ID.

Creates a
revocation certificate for a User ID.

If
’--revocation-key’ is provided, then that key is
used to create the signature. If that key is different from
the certificate being revoked, this creates a third-party
revocation. This is normally only useful if the owner of the
certificate designated the key to be a designated
revoker.

If
’--revocation-key’ is not provided, then the
certificate must include a certification-capable key.

’sq key
userid revoke’ respects the reference time set by the
top-level ’--time’ argument. When set, it uses
the specified time instead of the current time, when
determining what keys are valid, and it sets the revocation
certificate’s creation time to the reference time
instead of the current time.

OPTIONS

Subcommand
options 
-B, --binary

Emit binary data

--certificate-file=CERT_FILE

Read the certificate to revoke
from CERT_FILE or stdin, if omitted. It is an error for the
file to contain more than one certificate.

--notation NAME
VALUE

Add a notation to the
certification. A user-defined notation’s name must be
of the form ’name [AT] a.org’. If
the notation’s name starts with a ’!’,
then the notation is marked as being critical. If a consumer
of a signature doesn’t understand a critical notation,
then it will ignore the signature. The notation is marked as
being human readable.

-o,
--output=FILE

Write to FILE or stdout if
omitted

--private-key-store=KEY_STORE

Provide parameters for private
key store

--revocation-file=KEY_FILE

Sign the revocation certificate
using the key in KEY_FILE. If the key is different from the
certificate, this creates a third-party revocation. If this
option is not provided, and the certificate includes secret
key material, then that key is used to sign the revocation
certificate.

USERID

The User ID to revoke. By
default, this must exactly match a self-signed User ID. Use
’--force’ to generate a revocation certificate
for a User ID, which is not self signed.

REASON

The reason for the revocation.
This must be either: ’retired’, or
’unspecified’:

-
’retired’ means that this User ID is no longer
valid. This is 
appropriate when someone leaves an organisation, and the

organisation does not have their secret key material. For

instance, if someone was part of Debian and retires, they
would 
use this to indicate that a Debian-specific User ID is no
longer 
valid.

-
’unspecified’ means that a different reason
applies.

If the reason
happened in the past, you should specify that using the
’--time’ argument. This allows OpenPGP
implementations to more accurately reason about objects
whose validity depends on the validity of a User ID.

MESSAGE

A short, explanatory text that
is shown to a viewer of the revocation certificate. It
explains why the certificate has been revoked. For instance,
if Alice has created a new key, she would generate a
’superseded’ revocation certificate for her old
key, and might include the message ’I’ve created
a new certificate, FINGERPRINT, please use that in the
future.’
