OAuth oauth

NAME

dpt-github-oauth
- Generate GitHub OAuth2 token

SYNOPSIS

 dpt github-oauth [note-text]

DESCRIPTION

dpt
github-oauth can be used for obtaining an OAuth2 token
for authenticating to GitHub services without the need to
enter your password on every request. The reason for this
script is to allow you to populate the
"DPT_GITHUB_OAUTH" setting in
dpt.conf or ~/.config/dpt.conf easily.

You cannot
obtain an OAuth2 token with this script if you have
two-factor authentication (2FA) enabled on GitHub.

An alternative
method for obtaining the token is to use the GitHub web
interface, Applications->Personal Access Tokens.

The token
obtained with this program is authorized only for reporting
issues.

The only
supported argument, note-text, is a short note
associated with the token. It is used for easy
distinguishing different tokens and their purpose. If not
specified, the string "pkg-perl-tools on host
$HOSTNAME" is used, where $HOSTNAME is
obtained via Sys::Hostname.

The GitHub user
name and password are prompted for and canâ€™t be
supplied as command-line options.
