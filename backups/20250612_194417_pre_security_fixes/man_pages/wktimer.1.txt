existing timer’s start time.

timers if no name given).

existing timer’s stop time.

-i

Show I-Start when printing the table with -L.

-s

-t file

Notes

Restamping the
start mark of a timer will add the elapsed time to the
cumulative count.

Restamping the
stop mark of a timer will extend the elapsed time (and thus,
cumulative time) to "now".
