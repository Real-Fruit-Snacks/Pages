Name

hcdplay —
Control autonomous CDDA playback using Linux CDROM
ioctls

Syntax

hcdplay
[-CEPRSTs] [-D device] [-p
first-track [last-track]]

Description

CD-DA discs in
CD-ROM drives can either be played back using Digital Audio
Extraction (DAE) where software requests sector by sector,
or by using the drive’s autonomous playback functions,
whereby the drive’s firmware will do the sector
reading. Software is only required for a few control codes
to initiate or terminate playback. (If the drive possesses
extra buttons besides the eject function, such as the Sony
CDU5221, Autonomous Playback can even be controlled using
that method as well.)

With this
autonomous play mode, the drive can/will output sound using
a variety of methods. Common ones are a 3.5mm headphone jack
and a 4-pin Analog Audio connector that is supposed to be
connected a soundcard. These are often lacking nowadays,
especially external drives, slimline drives, and even
internal 5.25" SATA drives. As such, these drives often
do not even implement the Autonomous Playback functions
anymore (the particular ATA commands are ignored).

--close

Request that the drive be
closed.

-P, --pause

Pause playback. This can only
be issued if the CD-ROM drive is in the Playing state.

-R, --resume

Resume playback. This can only
be issued if the CD-ROM drive is in the Paused state.

-S, --stop

-T, --toc

table of contents (TOC).

-p, --play
[first-track [last-track]]

Start playback of
first-track and play until last-track. If no
first track is specified, starts from 1. If no last track is
specified, it will play until the end of the disc.

Start playback.
