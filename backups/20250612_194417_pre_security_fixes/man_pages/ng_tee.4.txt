NG_TEE(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual NG_TEE(4)

NAME

ng_tee — netgraph
’’tee’’ node type

SYNOPSIS

#include 

#include 

DESCRIPTION

The tee node type has a
purpose similar to the tee(1) command. Tee nodes are
useful for debugging or ’’snooping’’
on a connection between two netgraph nodes. Tee nodes
have four hooks, right, left, right2left, and left2right.
All data received on right is sent unmodified to both
hooks left and right2left. Similarly, all data received on
left is sent unmodified to both right and left2right.

Packets may also
be received on right2left and left2right; if so, they are
forwarded unchanged out hooks right and left,
respectively.

HOOKS

This node type supports the
following hooks:

right

The connection
to the node on the right.

left

The connection
to the node on the left.

right2left

Tap for right
to left traffic.

left2right

Tap for left to
right traffic.

CONTROL MESSAGES

This node type supports the
generic control messages, plus the following.

NGM_TEE_GET_STATS
(getstats)

Get statistics, returned as a
struct ng_tee_stats.

NGM_TEE_CLR_STATS
(clrstats)

Clear statistics.

SHUTDOWN

This node shuts down upon
receipt of an NGM_SHUTDOWN control message, or when all
hooks have been disconnected. If both right and left hooks
are present, node removes itself from the chain gently,
connecting right and left together.

SEE ALSO

tee(1), netgraph(4),
ngctl(8)

HISTORY

The ng_tee node type was
implemented in FreeBSD 4.0.
