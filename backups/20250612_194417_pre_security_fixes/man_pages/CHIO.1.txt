CHIO(1) BSD General Commands Manual CHIO(1)

NAME

chio — medium
changer control utility

SYNOPSIS

chio
[−f changer] command
[−] arg1 arg2
[arg3 [...]]

DESCRIPTION

The chio utility is used
to control the operation of medium changers, such as those
found in tape and optical disk jukeboxes.

The options are
as follows:

−f
changer

Use the device changer
rather than the default device /dev/ch0.

The default
changer may be overridden by setting the environment
variable CHANGER to the desired changer device.

A medium changer
apparatus is made up of elements. There are five
element types: picker (medium transport), slot
(storage), portal (import/export), drive (data
transfer), and voltag (select by volume identifier).
The voltag pseudo-element type allows the selection
of tapes by their volume tag (typically a barcode on the
tape).

In this command
description, the shorthand ET will be used to
represent an element type, and EU will be used to
represent an element unit. For example, to represent the
first robotic arm in the changer, the ET would be
’’picker’’ and the EU would
be ’’0’’.

SUPPORTED COMMANDS 
move 
    [inv]

Move the media unit from
 to . If the
optional modifier inv is specified, the media unit
will be inverted before insertion.

exchange 
    [ ]
[inv1] [inv2]

Perform a media unit exchange
operation. The media unit in  is
moved to  and the media unit
previously in  is moved to
. In the case of a simple exchange,
 is omitted and the values
 are used in their place. The
optional modifiers inv1 and inv2 specify
whether the media units are to be inverted before insertion
into  and 
respectively.

Note that not
all medium changers support the exchange operation;
the changer must have multiple free pickers or emulate
multiple free pickers with transient storage.

return 

Return the media unit to its
source element. This command will query the status of the
specified media unit, and will move it to the element
specified in its source attribute. This is a convenient way
to return media from a drive or portal to its previous
element in the changer.

position 
  [inv]

Position the picker in front of
the element described by . If the
optional modifier inv is specified, the media unit
will be inverted before insertion.

Note that not
all changers behave as expected when issued this
command.

params

Report the
number of slots, drives, pickers, and portals in the
changer, and which picker unit the changer is currently
configured to use.

getpicker

Report which picker unit the
changer is currently configured to use.

setpicker 

Configure the changer to use
picker .

ielem 
[]

Perform an INITIALIZE
ELEMENT STATUS operation on the changer. The optional
 parameter may be given to specify a
timeout in seconds for the operations. This may be used if
the operation takes unusually long because of buggy firmware
or the like.

voltag 
[−fca]  
[] []

Change volume tag for an
element in the media changer. This command is only supported
by few media changers. If it is not supported by a device,
using this command will usually result in an "Invalid
Field in CDB" error message on the console.

If the
−c flag is specified, the volume tag of the
specified element is cleared. If the −f flag is
specified, the volume tag is superseded with the specified
volume tag even if a volume tag is already defined for the
element. It is an error to not specify the −f
flag when trying to set a label for an element which already
has volume tag information defined.

The command
works with the primary volume tag or, if the −a
flag is given, with the alternate volume tag.

status 
[−vVsSbIa] []

Report the status of all
elements in the changer. If  is
specified, report the status of all elements of type
.

−v

Print the
primary volume tag for each loaded medium, if any. The
volume tag is printed as
’’’’.

−V

Print the
alternate volume tag for each loaded medium, if any.

−s

Print the
additional sense code and additional sense code qualifier
for each element.

−S

Print the
element source address for each element.

−b

Print SCSI bus
information for each element. Note that this information is
valid only for drives.

−I

Print the
internal element addresses for each element. The internal
element address is not normally used with this driver. It is
reported for diagnostic purposes only.

−a

Print all
additional information (as in −vVsSba).

The status bits
are defined as follows:

FULL

Element
contains a media unit.

IMPEXP

Media was
deposited into element by an outside human operator.

EXCEPT

Element is in
an abnormal state.

ACCESS

Media in this
element is accessible by a picker.

EXENAB

Element
supports passing media (exporting) to an outside human
operator.

INENAB

Element
supports receiving media (importing) from an outside human
operator.

EXAMPLES 
chio move slot 3 drive 0

Move the media in slot 3
(fourth slot) to drive 0 (first drive).

chio move voltag VOLUME01 drive
0

Move the media with the barcode
VOLUME01 to drive 0 (first drive).

chio return drive 0

Remove the tape from drive 0
(first drive) and return it to its original location in the
rack.

chio setpicker 2

Configure the changer to use
picker 2 (third picker) for operations.
