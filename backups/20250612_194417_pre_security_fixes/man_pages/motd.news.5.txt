NAME

motd.news -
Message of the day information for feeders or readers

DESCRIPTION

Two files,
found in pathetc, contain local information for news
feeders or news readers in a free-form format. The entire
files are returned verbatim to any client that issues the
LIST MOTD command. This might be used for new information,
notification of upcoming downtime, or similar purposes.

These files are
named motd.innd (for news feeders) and
motd.nnrpd (for news readers); they are used by
innd and nnrpd, respectively.

Make sure that
these files are encoded in UTF-8. They should also be
"dot-stuffed", that is to say that a line
beginning with a dot should have that dot doubled.

Be aware that
use of the LIST MOTD command is not widespread (though
documented in RFC 6048) and most news clients will
never ask for this file.

If one or both
of these files are missing, it is not an error. The server
will just send the client the appropriate response for an
unmaintained motd.innd or motd.nnrpd file.

On a fresh INN
install, samples for these files are installed in
pathetc; you will therefore find in
motd.innd.sample and motd.nnrpd.sample a few
examples of messages that can be communicated to news
clients.
