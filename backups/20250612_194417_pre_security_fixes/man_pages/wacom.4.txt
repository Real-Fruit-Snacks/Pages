DESCRIPTION

wacom is
an X input driver for Wacom devices.

The
wacom driver functions as a pointer input device.

SUPPORTED HARDWARE

This driver
supports the Wacom IV and Wacom V protocols. Serial tablets
only need this driver. USB tablet support is available on
some Linux platforms and requires the wacom kernel driver
being loaded before this driver starts.

Please check
https://github.com/linuxwacom for latest updates of Wacom X
and kernel drivers.

DRIVER-INTERNAL DEVICE HOTPLUGGING

When input
device hotplugging in the X server is enabled and no
InputDevice section exists for a compatible tablet
device and an InputClass section (see
xorg.conf.d(5x)) assigns this driver for the device, the
wacom driver creates multiple X devices for each a
physical device, one X device for each available tool. The
list of tools is hardware-dependent. See Option Type
as outlined in the CONFIGURATION DETAILS section.

These
tool-specific devices are referred to as parent device and
dependent device. The parent device is the one presented by
the system and the one that causes the X server to load the
wacom driver. This parent device then causes the
automatic addition of several dependent devices. If the
parent device is unplugged or otherwise removed, the
dependent devices will be automatically removed as well.

Dependent
devices may be assigned tool-specific options through
additional InputClass sections. We recommend that a
MatchDriver wacom line is used in these sections in
addition to the user-specific pattern.

Match
directives are applied by the X server before the driver is
selected. The type name of the parent device is appended by
the driver. It is not possible to use a MatchProduct
directive to match against this appended type name.

CONFIGURATION DETAILS

Please refer to
xorg.conf(5x) or xorg.conf.d(5x) for general configuration
details and for options that can be used with all input
drivers. This section only covers configuration details
specific to this driver.

Multiple
instances of the Wacom devices can cohabit. Each device
supports the following entries: 
Option "Type"
"stylus"|"eraser"|"cursor"|"pad"|"touch"

sets the type of tool the
device represents. This option is mandatory. The core
options, such as "SendCoreEvents" or
"AlwaysCore", are unnecessary in Gimp if you
don’t need to move system cursor outside of Gimp
drawing area. "pad" is for Intuos 3 or Cintiq 21UX
tablet ExpressKeys/menu strips, and Graphire 4 or Bamboo
tablet buttons, wheel, and/or ring. It is required for
Intuos3, CintiqV5, Graphire 4, and Bamboo if you want to use
keystroke features. "pad" is reported as a second
tool in the driver. "touch" is for the tablet with
touch support. Right now only a few Tablet PCs have this
feature.

Option
"Device" "path"

sets the path to the special
file which represents serial line where the tablet is
plugged. You have to specify it for each subsection with the
same value if you want to have multiple devices with the
same tablet. This option is mandatory.

Option
"Suppress" "number"

sets the position increment
under which not to transmit coordinates. This entry must be
specified only in the first Wacom subsection if you have
multiple devices for one tablet. If you don’t specify
this entry, the default value, which is 2, will be used. To
disable suppression, the entry should be specified as 0.
When suppress is defined, an event will be sent only when at
least one of the following conditions is met:

the change
between the current X coordinate and the previous one is
greater than suppress;

the change
between the current Y coordinate and the previous one is
greater than suppress;

the change
between the current pressure and the previous one is greater
than suppress;

the change
between the current degree of rotation and the previous one
of the transducer is greater than suppress;

the change
between the current absolute wheel value and the previous
one is equal to or greater than suppress;

the change
between the current tilt value and the previous one is equal
to or greater than suppress (if tilt is supported);

relative wheel
value has changed;

button value
has changed;

proximity has
changed.

Option
"Mode"
"Relative"|"Absolute"

sets the mode of the device.
The default value for stylus, pad and eraser is Absolute;
cursor is Relative; touch defaults to Relative for tablets
with touch pads and Absolute for touch screens.

Option
"TopX" "number"

X coordinate of the top corner
of the active zone. Default to 0.

Option
"TopY" "number"

Y coordinate of the top corner
of the active zone. Default to 0.

Option
"BottomX" "number"

X coordinate of the bottom
corner of the active zone. Default to width of the
tablet.

Option
"BottomY" "number"

Y coordinate of the bottom
corner of the active zone. Default to height of the
tablet.

Option
"ButtonsOnly"
"on"|"off"

disables the device’s
motion events. Default to off.

Option
"ButtonM" "AC"

reports an action AC when
button M is pressed, where M is one of the device supported
button numbers, it can be 1 to 32. Wacom uses a
driver-internal button mapping, where any physical button
appears to the X server as the button specified by the
ButtonM mapping. Hence, if two physical buttons have the
same ButtonM mapping, the server will think they are the
same physical button. The default action reported to the X
server is mouse button M click. Because X uses buttons 4, 5,
6, and 7 as the four scrolling directions, physical buttons
4 and higher are mapped to 8 and higher by default. Only
simple button presses can be configured here; for more
complex actions, use xsetwacom(1). To ignore the button
click, i.e., to not report any button click event to the X
server, use "0" or "button 0".

Option
"TPCButton"
"on"|"off"

enables the stylus buttons as
Tablet PC buttons. If enabled, the stylus reports button
events only when its tip is pressed. If any button is down,
pressing the tip reports a button event for the button.
Otherwise if no button is down, the tip reports as usual.
Default to "on" for Tablet PCs; "off"
for all other models. Only available on the stylus tool.

Option
"Touch" "on"|"off"

enables touch events for touch
devices, i.e., system cursor moves when user touches the
tablet. Default to "on" for devices that support
touch; "off" for all other models.

Option
"Rotate"
"CW"|"CCW"|"HALF"|"NONE"

rotates the tablet orientation
counterclockwise (CCW) or clockwise (CW) or 180 degrees
(HALF). If you have specific tablet mappings, i.e. TopX/Y or
BottomX/Y were set, the mapping will be applied before
rotation. Rotation must be applied to the parent device
(usually the stylus), rotation settings on in-driver
hotplugged devices (see DRIVER-INTERNAL DEVICE
HOTPLUGGING ) will be ignored. The default is
"NONE".

Option
"PressCurve" "x1,y1,x2,y2"

sets pressure curve by control
points x1, y1, x2, and y2. Their values are in range from
0..100. The pressure curve is interpreted as Bezier curve
with 4 control points, the first and the last control point
being fixed on the coordinates 0/0 and 100/100,
respectively. The middle control points are adjustible by
this setting and thus define the shape of the curve. The
input for linear curve (default) is "0,0,100,100";
slightly depressed curve (firmer) might be
"5,0,100,95"; slightly raised curve (softer) might
be "0,5,95,100". The pressure curve is only
applicable to devices of type stylus or eraser, other
devices do not honor this setting.

Option
"Pressure2K" "bool"

reduces the pressure range to
the range of 0 to 2048 for backwards compatibility with
applications that have this range hardcoded. See section
BUGS. This option should not be used unless the user
runs one or more applications that rely on a hardcoded
pressure range.

Option
"DebugLevel" "number"

sets the level of debugging
info for tool-specific messages. There are 12 levels,
specified by the integers between 1 and 12. All debug
messages with a level less than or equal to the
"number" will be logged into the Xorg log file.
This option is only available if the driver was built with
debugging support.

Option
"CommonDBG" "number"

sets the level of debugging
info for common (i.e. not tool-specific) code paths on the
tablet. There are 12 levels, specified by the integers
between 1 and 12. All debug messages with a level less than
or equal to the "number" will be logged into the
Xorg log file. This option is only available if the driver
was built with debugging support.

Option
"GrabDevice" "bool"

sets whether the underlying
event device will be grabbed by the driver to prevent the
data from leaking to /dev/input/mice. When enabled, while
the X server is running, no other programs will be able to
read the event stream. Default: "false".

Option
"CursorProx" "number"

sets the distance at which a
relative tool is treated as being out of proximity. Beyond
this distance the cursor will stop responding to tool
motion. The default value for pucks is 10 (Intuos Pro) or 42
(Intuos/Bamboo). The default value for pens is 30.

Option
"RawSample" "number"

Set the sample window size (a
sliding average sampling window) for incoming input tool raw
data points. Default: 4, range of 1 to 20.

Option
"Serial" "number"

sets the serial number
associated with the physical device. This allows to have
multiple devices of the same type (i.e. multiple pens). This
option is only available on wacom V devices (Intuos series
and Cintiq 21U). To see which serial number belongs to a
device, you need to run the utility program, xsetwacom,
which comes with linuxwacom package.

Option
"ToolSerials"
"number[,type[,label]][;...]"

sets the list of serial
numbered devices that need to be hotplugged for a physical
device. The ’type’ option may be any of
"pen", "airbrush", "artpen",
or "cursor". This option is only available on
wacom V devices which are capable of reporting a serial
number. To see if a connected device is supported, or to
identify which serial number belongs to a device, you need
to run the utility program, xsetwacom, that comes with this
driver. In layman’s terms, this option will add
additional X devices for this specific tool’s tip (and
eraser, if applicable). This is useful for programs like
gimp (which remembers tools based on the X device) to recall
additional drawing tool selections for an airbrush+eraser,
art pen, extra pen, etc.

Option
"Threshold" "number"

sets the pressure threshold
used to generate a button 1 events of stylus. The threshold
applies to the normalised pressure range of [0..2048]. The
default is 27.

Option
"Gesture" "bool"

Enable or disable multi-finger
in-driver gesture support on the device. Default: off unless
the tablet supports multi-touch. Note that disabling this
option may allow the desktop environment to detect
multi-finger gestures instead.

Option
"ZoomDistance" "number"

If Option
"Gesture" is enabled, this option specifies
the minimum movement distance before a zoom gesture is
recognized.

Option
"ScrollDistance" "number"

If Option
"Gesture" is enabled, this option specifies
the minimum movement distance before a scroll gesture is
recognized.

Option
"TapTime" "number"

If Option
"Gesture" is enabled, this option
determines the maximum time of a touch event to be
recognized as tap. A press and release event shorter than
TapTime generates button press and release events.
Presses longer than TapTime do not generate button
events, only motion events.

Option
"PressureRecalibration"
"bool"

Allows to disable pressure
recalibration. Default: true. If the initial pressure of a
device is != 0 the driver recalibrates the pressure range.
This is to account for worn out devices. The downside is
that when the user hits the tablet very hard the initial
pressure reading may be unequal to zero even for a perfectly
good pen. If the consecutive pressure readings are not
higher than the initial pressure by a threshold no button
event will be generated. This option allows to disable the
recalibration.

Option
"PanScrollThreshold" "number"

Specifies the distance the pen
must move (in tablet units) before a scroll event is
generated when using the "pan" action. Smaller
values will require less distance and be more sensitive.
Larger values will require more distance and be less
sensitive. Default: 1300 or 2600 depending on tablet
resolution (corresponds to 13 mm of distance).

Option
"SmoothPanscrollingEnabled"
"bool"

Allows to disable smooth
panscrolling. Default: true. If disabled, panscrolling sends
legacy button events instead. This option exists for
backwards compatibility with applications that have the
number of axes on a device limited to 6. See section
BUGS for more details. This option should not be used
unless the user runs one or more applications that do not
support more than six axes.

TOUCH GESTURES

Single
finger (1FG) 
Left click: tap, actual click happens after TapTime
period elapses.

Left click
drag: tap to select, quickly (within TapTime period)
touch selection again. Then drag. Available on touchpads,
e.g. BambooPT, not touchscreens.

Two finger
(2FG) 
Right click: one finger down + tap second finger

Vertical
scroll: two fingers side by side (in any orientation)
moving vertically with constant separation initiates a
vertical scroll. By driver default a gesture up results in a
scroll down event (the document moves up) and a gesture down
results in a scroll up event (moving the document down).

Horizontal
scroll: two fingers side by side held at a constant
distance moving horizontally initiates a horizontal scroll.
A gesture to the left results in a scroll right event (the
document moves left) and a gesture right results in a scroll
left event (moving the document right).

Zoom in:
two separated fingers side by side, bring together i.e.
pinch.

Zoom
out: two fingers side by side, spread. Not all
applications support zoom.

BUGS

Pressure
range increase leads to unexpected behavior 
In version 0.34, the driver’s pressure range increased
from 2048 steps to 65536 steps. The pressure axis range is
advertised through the X Input Protocol but some
applications have the previous pressure range hardcoded and
cannot handle pressure values above 2048. This is an
application bug but for backwards-compatibility with such
applications, this driver provides the Pressure2K
option to reduce the range to 2048 steps. Note that this
setting applies to the device. Once applied, all
applications will see the reduced pressure range. It is not
possible to provide this setting on a per-application
basis.

Smooth
panscrolling exceeds the axis limits 
In version 1.2.0, the driver’s support for smooth
panscrolling added two axes to the stylus device, bringing
the total axis count to eight. The number of axes is
advertised through the X Input Protocol but some
applications (notably GIMP 2.xx) cannot handle more than six
axes. This is an application bug but for
backwards-compatibility with such applications, this driver
provides the SmoothPanscrollingEnabled option to
disable this feature and thus limit the axis count to six.
Note that this setting applies to the device. Once applied,
the driver will not send smooth panscroll events at all. It
is not possible to provide this setting on a per-application
basis.
