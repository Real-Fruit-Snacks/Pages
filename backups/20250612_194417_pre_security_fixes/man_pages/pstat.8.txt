PSTAT(8) BSD System Manager’s Manual PSTAT(8)

NAME

pstat — display
system data structures

SYNOPSIS

pstat
[−Tfnstv] [−M core]
[−N system]

DESCRIPTION

Pstat displays open file
entry, swap space utilization, terminal state, and vnode
data structures. If corefile is given, the
information is sought there, otherwise in /dev/kmem.
The required namelist is taken from /vmunix unless
system is specified. The −n option
specifies that devices should be printed out by major/minor
number rather than by name.

Options are

−T

Prints the
number of used and free slots in the several system tables
and is useful for checking to see how large system tables
have become if the system is under heavy load.

−f

Print the open
file table with these headings:

LOC

The core
location of this table entry.

TYPE

The type of
object the file table entry points to.

FLG

Miscellaneous
state variables encoded thus:

R

open for
reading

W

open for
writing

A

open for
appending

S

shared lock
present

X

exclusive lock
present

I

signal pgrp
when data ready

CNT

Number of
processes that know this open file.

MSG

Number of
messages outstanding for this file.

DATA

The location of
the vnode table entry or socket structure for this file.

OFFSET

The file offset
(see lseek(2)).

−s

Print
information about swap space usage on all the swap areas
compiled into the kernel. The first column is the device
name of the partition. The next column is the total space
available in the partition. The Used column indicates
the total blocks used so far; the Available column
indicates how much space is remaining on each partition. The
Capacity reports the percentage of space used.

If more than
one partition is configured into the system, totals for all
of the statistics will be reported in the final line of the
report.

−t

Print table for
terminals with these headings:

RAW

Number of
characters in raw input queue.

CAN

Number of
characters in canonicalized input queue.

OUT

Number of
characters in output queue.

MODE

See tty(4).

ADDR

Physical device
address.

DEL

Number of
delimiters (newlines) in canonicalized input queue.

COL

Calculated
column position of terminal.

STATE

Miscellaneous
state variables encoded thus:

T

delay timeout
in progress

W

waiting for
open to complete

O

open

F

outq has been
flushed during DMA

C

carrier is
on

B

busy doing
output

A

process is
awaiting output

X

open for
exclusive use

S

output
stopped

H

hangup on
close

PGRP

Process group
for which this is controlling terminal.

DISC

Line
discipline; blank is old tty OTTYDISC or ’new
tty’ for NTTYDISC or ’net’ for NETLDISC
(see bk(4)).

−v

Print the
active vnodes. Each group of vnodes corresponding to a
particular filesystem is preceded by a two line header. The
first line consists of the following:

*** MOUNT
fstype from on on fsflags

where
fstype is one of ufs, nfs, mfs,
or pc; from is the filesystem is mounted from;
on is the directory the filesystem is mounted on; and
fsflags is a list of optional flags applied to the
mount (see mount(8)). the first part of which are fixed, and
the second part are filesystem type specific. The headers
common to all vnodes are:

ADDR

Location of
this vnode.

TYP

File type.

VFLAG

A list of letters representing
vnode flags:

R

−
VROOT

T

−
VTEXT

L

−
VXLOCK

W

−
VXWANT

E

−
VEXLOCK

S

−
VSHLOCK

T

−
VLWAIT

A

−
VALIASED

B

−
VBWAIT

USE

The number of
references to this vnode.

HOLD

The number of
I/O buffers held by this vnode.

FILEID

The vnode
fileid. In the case of ufs this is the inode
number.

IFLAG

Miscellaneous
filesystem specific state variables encoded thus:

For ufs:

L

locked

U

update time
(fs(5)) must be corrected

A

access time
must be corrected

W

wanted by
another process (L flag is on)

C

changed time
must be corrected

S

shared lock
applied

E

exclusive lock
applied

Z

someone waiting
for a lock

M

contains
modifications

R

has a rename in
progress

For nfs:

W

waiting for I/O
buffer flush to complete

P

I/O buffers
being flushed

M

locally
modified data exists

E

an earlier
write failed

X

non-cacheable
lease (nqnfs)

O

write lease
(nqnfs)

G

lease was
evicted (nqnfs)

SIZ/RDEV

Number of bytes in an ordinary
file, or major and minor device of special file.

FILES 
/vmunix

namelist

/dev/kmem

default source
of tables

BUGS

Swap statistics are reported for
all swap partitions compiled into the kernel, regardless of
whether those partitions are being used.

Does not
understand NFS swap servers.

HISTORY

The pstat command
appeared in 4.0BSD.
