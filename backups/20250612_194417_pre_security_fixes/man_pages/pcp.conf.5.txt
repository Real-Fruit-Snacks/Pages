NAME

pcp.conf
- the Performance Co-Pilot configuration and environment
file

SYNOPSIS

/etc/pcp.conf

DESCRIPTION

When using
Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) tools and utilities and when
calling PCP library functions, a standard set of environment
variables are defined in /etc/pcp.conf. These
variables are generally used to specify the location of
various PCP pieces in the file system and may be loaded into
shell scripts by sourcing the /etc/pcp.env(5) shell
script and queried by C/C++ programs using the
pmGetConfig(3) library function. If a variable is
already defined in the environment, the values in
pcp.conf do not override those values, i.e.
the values in pcp.conf serve as installation defaults
only.

Both the
pcp.env and pcp.conf files are expected to be
found in /etc by default. If required, the
pcp.conf file may be relocated and PCP_CONF
set in the environment to specify the full path to the new
location. The pcp.env file can not be relocated (this
is the only hard coded path required by PCP).

The syntax
rules for pcp.conf are as follows :

1.

the general syntax is

PCP_VARIABLE_NAME=variable value to
end of line

2.

lines that begin with #
and all blank lines are ignored.

3.

all variables must be prefixed with PCP_. This is
a security issue - variables that do not have this prefix
will be silently ignored.

4.

there should be no space between the variable name and
the literal = and no space between the = and
the variable value (unless the value actually starts with a
space). This is required because the pcp.conf file
may be sourced directly by Makefiles as well as interpreted
by the pcp.env script and the pmGetConfig
function. 

5.

variable values may contain spaces and should not
be quoted. The pcp.env script automatically quotes
all variable values from the character immediately following
the = through to the end of the line.

For further
details and an explanation of the use of each variable, see
the comments in the /etc/pcp.conf file itself.

ENVIRONMENT

The
PCP_CONF environment variable specifies an
alternative path to the pcp.conf file.
