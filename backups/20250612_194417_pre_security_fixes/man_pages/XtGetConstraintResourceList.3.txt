XtGetResourceList(3)             XT FUNCTIONS             XtGetResourceList(3)



NAME
       XtGetResourceList, XtGetConstraintResourceList - obtain resource list

SYNTAX
       #include <X11/Intrinsic.h>

       void XtGetResourceList(WidgetClass class, XtResourceList *resources_re‐
              turn, Cardinal *num_resources_return);

       void XtGetConstraintResourceList(WidgetClass class, XtResourceList *re‐
              sources_return, Cardinal *num_resources_return);

ARGUMENTS
       num_resources_return
                 Specifies a pointer to where to store the number of entries
                 in the resource list.

       resources_return
                 Specifies a pointer to where to store the returned resource
                 list.  The caller must free this storage using XtFree when
                 done with it.

       widget_class
                 Specifies the widget class for which you want the list.

DESCRIPTION
       If XtGetResourceList is called before the widget class is initialized
       (that is, before the first widget of that class has been created),
       XtGetResourceList returns the resource list as specified in the widget
       class record.  If it is called after the widget class has been initial‐
       ized, XtGetResourceList returns a merged resource list that contains
       the resources for all superclasses.  The list returned by XtGet‐
       ResourceList should be freed using XtFree when it is no longer needed.

       If XtGetConstraintResourceList is called before the widget class is
       initialized (that is, before the first widget of that class has been
       created), XtGetConstraintResourceList returns the resource list as
       specified in the widget class Constraint part record.  If it is called
       after the widget class has been initialized, XtGetConstraintResource‐
       List returns a merged resource list that contains the Constraint re‐
       sources for all superclasses.  If the specified class is not a subclass
       of constraintWidgetClass, *resources_return is set to NULL and *num_re‐
       sources_return is set to zero.  The list returned by XtGetConstraint‐
       ResourceList should be freed using XtFree when it is no longer needed.
