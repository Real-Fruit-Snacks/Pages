NAME

dpt-invite-github
- Invite someone to a GitHub organization

SYNOPSIS

    dpt invite-github [option...] {github-username}

DESCRIPTION

dpt
invite-github can be used for inviting people to become
members of a GitHub organization. You can set the
organization name through
"DPT_GITHUB_ORGNAME" environment variable
(defaults to pkg-perl-tools).

This script
needs the "DPT_GITHUB_OAUTH" environment
variable, which can be set in ~/.dpt.conf or
~/.config/dpt.conf. Cf. dpt-github-oauth(1)
and dpt-config(5).

You need to
have write access to the "admin:org"
scope to be able to manage organization memberships. Please,
make sure the token you use has that scope in
https://github.com/settings/tokens>.

OPTIONS

--role
name

This option sets the role for
the user. Valid roles are admin or member,
which is the default.

--force

Use this option if the GitHub
user is already a member of the organization and you want to
change their role anyway.
