Match strings against glob paterns

SYNOPSIS

match
[−gilrqs] [−n ] [−c cmd]
[−x code] {[−p] pattern | −f
} str1 [str2 ...]

DESCRIPTION

match checks
strings against pattern, which should be a shell-like
glob pattern. pattern may contain the following
special characters:

?

A "?" character in pattern
matches any single character in the string, except that the
"/" character is only matched if match
was given the −s option.

*

A "*" character in pattern
matches zero or more characters in the string. The exception
is that it will only match "/" characters
if match was given the −s option.

[...]

A set of characters between
square brackets matches any character in the set. In
addition, the "−" character can be
used to specify a range. For example
"[+e0−3]" would match any of the
characters "+", "e",
0, 1, 2, or 3 in the
input string. To include a hyphen
("−") in the set of characters
matched, either include the hyphen first or last, or escape
it with a "\".

[!...]

A character class preceded by a
"!" matches any character but those
specified in the class. The exception is that the negated
character class will match a "/" only if
match was given the −s option.

\c

The backslash character escapes the next character
c. Thus, to match a literal "*",
you would use the pattern "\*".

match prints
each string that matches pattern, one per line, and
exits 0 if one or more strings matched. If no string
matches, match exits with status 67 (or whatever alternate
status was specified by the −x flag). If the
−n n flag was specified, match prints
only the text that matched the nth occurrence of
"*" in the patten.

OPTIONS

−f file

Specifies that the pattern
should be read from file. match will read each line
of the file and consider it as pattern to match against the
argument strings. For each argument string, match stops when
it hits the first matching line of the file. If file
does not exist, match exits 67, or whatever code was
specified by −x.

−g

Normally, the −n option selects text
matching particular "*" characters in the
patern. −g changes this behavior to use
parentheses for grouping. Thus, for instance, the text
"foo.c" would match pattern
"*(.[ch])", and the output with option
−n 1 would be ".c". To
include a literal "(" or
")" in the pattern with the
−g option, you must precede the character with
a "\".

−i

Makes the match case insensitive. str will be
considered to match if any variation on its capitalization
would match. For example, string "G"
would match pattern "[f−h]".

−l

When a pattern matches the string in more than one way,
the −l flag says to assign as much text as
possible to the leftmost "*"s in the
pattern. For example, pattern "*+*" would
match text "a+b+c", and the first
"*" would match "a+b".
This behavior is the default, thus −l’s
effect is only to undo a previous −r flag.

−n n

With this flag, match prints
the text that matched the nth "*"
in the pattern, as opposed to printing the whole string. The
leftmost "*" corresponds to −n
1. Specifying −n 0 causes match to print
the whole matching string. Specifying −n
−1 or using a value greater than the number of
"*"s in the pattern causes match not to
print anything, in which case you can still use the exit
status to see if there is a match. The default value for
n is 0, unless −g has also been
specified, in which case the default is 1.

−c
command

When −c is
specified, match runs command with the system shell
(/bin/sh), giving it as argument $0 the full
string that matched, and as arguments $1,
$2, etc., the parts of the string that matched any
"*"s in pattern. If the command
does not exit with status 0, match will exit immediately,
before processing further matches, with whatever status
command returned. The −c and
−n flags are mutually exclusive.

−p
pattern

Specifies the pattern to match
against. The −p flag is optional; you can
specify pattern as the first argument following the
options. However, if you want to try matching the same input
string against multiple patterns, then you must specify each
pattern with a −p flag.

−q

This option is synonymous with −n −1;
it suppresses output when there is a match. You can still
determine whether a match occurred by the exit status.

−r

When a pattern matches the string in more than one way,
the −r flag says to assign as much text as
possible to the rightmost "*"s in the
pattern. For example, with −r, pattern
"*+*" would match text
"a+b+c" with the "*"
matching "a", and the second matching
"b+c". 

−s

Ordinarily, "*",
"?", and negated character classes
("[!...]") do not match
"/" characters. −s changes
this behavior to match slashes.

−x code

By default, when there is no
match, match exits with status 67. With this option, match
exits with status code, instead.

EXAMPLES

Suppose you
have a directory with a bunch of files ending .c and
.o. If, for each file named foo.c you want to
attempt to delete the file foo.o, you can run the
following command:

     match −p '*.c' −c 'rm −f $1.o' *.c

Servers running
the mailman list manager often send mail from bounce
addresses of the form
listname−bounces [AT] host.com. If you
subscribe to multiple lists on the same server, the mailman
interface makes it easier if you subscribe under the same
address. To split the mail into multiple folders based on
the bounce address in the environment variable
SENDER , you might chose a mailbox
with the following shell code:

     name=`match −n1 "*−bounces [AT] host.com" "$SENDER"` \
          && echo "$HOME/Mail/incoming/host−$name.spool"
