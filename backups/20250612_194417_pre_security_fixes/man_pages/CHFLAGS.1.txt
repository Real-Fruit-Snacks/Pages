CHFLAGS(1) BSD General Commands Manual CHFLAGS(1)

NAME

chflags — change
file flags

SYNOPSIS

chflags [

−R
[−H | −L | −P]
] flags file ...

DESCRIPTION

The chflags utility
modifies the file flags of the listed files as specified by
the flags operand.

The options are
as follows:

−H

If the
−R option is specified, symbolic links on the
command line are followed. (Symbolic links encountered in
the tree traversal are not followed.)

−L

If the
−R option is specified, all symbolic links are
followed.

−P

If the
−R option is specified, no symbolic links are
followed. This is the default.

−R

Change the file
flags for the file hierarchies rooted in the files instead
of just the files themselves.

The flags are
specified as an octal number or a comma separated list of
keywords. The following keywords are currently defined:

arch

set the
archived flag (super-user only)

opaque

set the opaque
flag (owner or super-user only)

nodump

set the nodump
flag (owner or super-user only)

sappnd

set the system
append-only flag (super-user only)

schg

set the system
immutable flag (super-user only)

sunlnk

set the system
undeletable flag (super-user only)

uappnd

set the user
append-only flag (owner or super-user only)

uchg

set the user
immutable flag (owner or super-user only)

uunlnk

set the user
undeletable flag (owner or super-user only)

archived, sappend, schange, 
simmutable, uappend, uchange,
uimmutable, sunlink, uunlink

aliases for the above

Putting the
letters ’’no’’ before an
option causes the flag to be turned off. For example:

nouchg

the immutable
bit should be cleared

Symbolic links
do not have flags, so unless the −H or
−L option is set, chflags on a symbolic
link always succeeds and has no effect. The −H,
−L and −P options are ignored
unless the −R option is specified. In addition,
these options override each other and the command’s
actions are determined by the last one specified.

You can use
"ls -lo" to see the flags of existing files.

DIAGNOSTICS

The chflags utility
exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error
occurs.
