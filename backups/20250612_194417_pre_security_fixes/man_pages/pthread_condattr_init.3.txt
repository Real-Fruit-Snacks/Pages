NAME

pthread_condattr_init,
pthread_condattr_destroy - condition creation attributes

SYNOPSIS

#include

int
pthread_condattr_init(pthread_condattr_t
*attr);

int
pthread_condattr_destroy(pthread_condattr_t
*attr);

DESCRIPTION

Condition
attributes can be specified at condition creation time, by
passing a condition attribute object as second argument to
pthread_cond_init(3). Passing NULL is
equivalent to passing a condition attribute object with all
attributes set to their default values.

The
LinuxThreads implementation supports no attributes for
conditions. The functions on condition attributes are
included only for compliance with the POSIX standard.

pthread_condattr_init
initializes the condition attribute object attr and
fills it with default values for the attributes.
pthread_condattr_destroy destroys a condition
attribute object, which must not be reused until it is
reinitialized. Both functions do nothing in the LinuxThreads
implementation.

RETURN VALUE

pthread_condattr_init
and pthread_condattr_destroy always return 0.
