NAME

dh_installchangelogs
- install changelogs into package build directories

SYNOPSIS

dh_installchangelogs
[debhelper options] [-k]
[-Xitem] [upstream]

DESCRIPTION

dh_installchangelogs
is a debhelper program that is responsible for installing
changelogs into package build directories.

An upstream
changelog file may be specified as an option. If none
is specified, dh_installchangelogs may look for files
with names that seem likely to be changelogs as described in
the next paragraphs.

In non-native
packages, dh_installchangelogs will first look for
changelog files installed by the upstream build system into
usr/share/doc/package (of the package build
directory) and rename the most likely candidate (if any) to
usr/share/doc/package/changelog. Note that
dh_installchangelogs does not look into any
source directory (such as debian/tmp). Otherwise,
dh_installchangelogs (at compatibility level 7 or any
later) will look for changelog files in the source directory
(e.g. the root or the docs subdirectory). It will
look for changelog, changes and history
optionally with common extensions (such as .txt,
.md and .rst).

If a changelog
file is specified and is an html file (determined by
file extension), it will be installed as
usr/share/doc/package/changelog.html instead. If the
html changelog is converted to plain text, that variant can
be specified as a second parameter. When no plain text
variant is specified, a short
usr/share/doc/package/changelog is generated,
pointing readers at the html changelog file.

FILES

debian/changelog

debian/NEWS 
debian/package.changelog 
debian/package.NEWS

Automatically installed into
usr/share/doc/package/ in the package build
directory.

Use the package
specific name if package needs a different
NEWS or changelog file.

The
changelog file is installed with a name of changelog
for native packages, and changelog.Debian for
non-native packages. The NEWS file is
always installed with a name of NEWS
.Debian.

OPTIONS

-k,
--keep

Keep the original name of the
upstream changelog. This will be accomplished by installing
the upstream changelog as changelog, and making a
symlink from that to the original name of the
changelog file. This can be useful if the upstream
changelog has an unusual name, or if other documentation in
the package refers to the changelog file.

-Xitem,
--exclude=item

Exclude upstream
changelog files that contain item anywhere in
their filename from being installed.

Note that
directory name of the changelog is also part of the
match.

upstream

Install this file as the
upstream changelog.
