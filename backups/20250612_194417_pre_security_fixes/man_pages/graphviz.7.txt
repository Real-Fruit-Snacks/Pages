NAME

graphviz - rich
set of graph drawing tools

SYNOPSIS

This manpage
has been written to fulfil the need of a centralized
documentation presenting all available tools in the graphviz
package.

AVAILABLE TOOLS

Graph layout
programs

dot

filter for hierarchical layouts of graphs

neato

filter for symmetric layouts of graphs

twopi

filter for radial layouts of graphs

circo

filter for circular layout of graphs

fdp

filter for symmetric layouts of graphs

All of the
filters work with either directed or undirected graphs,
though dot is typically used for directed graphs and
neato for undirected graphs. Note also that neato
-n[2] can be used to render layouts produced by the
other filters.
