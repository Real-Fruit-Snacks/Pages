RELEASE NOTES FOR LIBGUESTFS 1.40

These release
notes only cover the differences from the previous
stable/dev branch split (1.38.0). For detailed changelogs,
please see the git repository, or the ChangeLog file
distributed in the tarball.

New
features 
New features in existing tools

Virt-inspector
now displays the libosinfo short ID for guests (Pino
Toscano).

Guestfish
-N will now generate 1G disks instead of 100M disks
by default.

Virt-resize
supports f2fs filesystems (Pino Toscano).

libguestfs-test-tool
now supports bash tab completion (Pino Toscano).

The
--machine-readable option now supports sending output
to files or stdout/stderr. This works uniformly across most
OCaml-based virt tools, specifically: virt-builder,
virt-builder-repository, virt-dib, virt-get-kernel,
virt-resize, virt-sparsify, and virt-v2v (Pino Toscano).

Virt-builder
--uninstall option now works on SUSE (Sebastian
Meyer).

Virt-builder
now supports Windows. We are not able to ship Windows
templates in the public repository for obvious licensing
reasons, but if you are an MSDN subscriber you may build
your own. See
https://rwmj.wordpress.com/2018/09/13/creating-windows-templates-for-virt-builder/

Many tools now
support a --key option allowing you to pass in
decryption keys for filesystems stored in local files on the
host rather than having to feed them in over stdin (Pino
Toscano).

virt-v2v and
virt-p2v

New -o
rhv-upload mode for directly uploading images to RHV,
bypassing the Export Storage Domain (Tomáš
Golembiovský, Nir Soffer, Daniel Erez, Pino
Toscano).

New -o
openstack mode for directly uploading images to
OpenStack and Cinder using OpenStack APIs.

Virt-v2v now
has a general mechanism for input and output options:
-io and -oo.

Virt-v2v can
now install the RHV tools or QEMU GA in guests
(Tomáš Golembiovský).

The huge manual
has now been split into several smaller documents and is
more focused on helping users to accomplish specific v2v
tasks.

Multiple
improvements to the OVF metadata when converting to RHV
(Tomáš Golembiovský, Pino Toscano, Arik
Hadas).

Virt-v2v can
now convert Linux guests with split kernel packages,
especially Ubuntu 18.04 (Pino Toscano).

Virt-v2v old
--password-file option has been replaced by
-ip (the old option remains for backwards
compatibility).

Virt-v2v now
preserves the VM Generation ID.

Virt-v2v has a
new --mac option allowing specific NICs to be mapped
precisely to networks or bridges on the target.

New virt-v2v
--print-estimate option to estimate the size of data
that virt-v2v will copy.

Virt-v2v is now
usually able to remove open-vm-tools and VMware Tools from
the Linux guest during conversion (Pino Toscano).

Virt-v2v can
now support UEFI conversions to RHV (Tomáš
Golembiovský).

Virt-p2v now
prefers you to shut down instead of rebooting the machine
after conversion has finished (Pino Toscano).

Virt-v2v now
writes the libosinfo short ID to the libvirt metadata when
using -o local and -o libvirt output modes
(Martin Kletzander).

Language
bindings

OpenJDK 10+ is
supported (Pino Toscano).

Java bindings
fixed for Gentoo host (Martin Kletzander).

Inspection

Support Kali
Linux (Pino Toscano).

When inspecting
mountpoints, look for /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf as well
as /etc/mdadm.conf (Nikolay Ivanets).

Improved
support for OpenSUSE Tumbleweed (Pino Toscano).

Architectures
and platforms

Miscellaneous
macOS build fixes (Adam Robinson).

Other

Multiple
documentation typos fixed (Yuri Chornoivan).

Security

See also guestfs-security(1).

CVE-2018-11806

Qemu’s
slirp (userspace networking) had several buffer overflows
which could be triggered from the guest or network side.

API

New APIs 
"f2fs_expand"

Expand an f2fs filesystem (Pino
Toscano).

"inspect_get_osinfo"

Get the libosinfo short ID for
the inspected guest (Pino Toscano).

"lvm_scan"

This rescans all PVs, VGs and
LVs, optionally activating them.

Other API
changes

"part_get_mbr_part_type"
was reimplemented in OCaml (Nikolay Ivanets).

"list_filesystems"
now filters out MBR extended partitions (Nikolay
Ivanets).

"vgscan"
has been deprecated. Use the new "lvm_scan" API in
preference.

Build
changes 
The JSON library switched from yajl to Jansson ≥ 2.7
(Pino Toscano).

Support for The
Sleuth Kit 4.5 (Pino Toscano).

Multiple
improvements in the "./configure" script (Lin
Ma).

More
out-of-tree build fixes (Hilko Bengen).

Some work on
reproducible builds (Bernhard M. Wiedemann).

Internals

lvmetad is now used unconditionally, and is started much
earlier in the appliance boot process. This fixes support
for certain PV types.

On Debian, dash
is installed inside the appliance and in virt-rescue (Pino
Toscano).

The amount of
RAM assigned to the appliance has been increased from 500M
to 768M (on x86_64, other architectures have different
limits). This enables use of up to 255 disks when using
recent Linux kernels.

Virt-v2v now
models the source machine type (eg. i440FX, Q35 or
virt).

Virt-p2v now
generates configuration code automatically, also code for
parsing the kernel command line.

Use
"LT_INIT" instead of
"AC_PROG_LIBTOOL".

The OCaml
"JSON" code for parsing and serializing has been
unified into a single abstract data type.

Most OCaml
tools are now built using the PIC runtime. This has a
performance penalty on i686, but is relatively free on other
architectures and has security benefits.

The direct
backend now queries the qemu binary for availability of KVM,
instead of using a heuristic based on /dev/kvm
(Andrea Bolognani).

Our
"clever" libxml2 writer macros are now used
consistently across all parts of the code base.

Qemu dropped
-nodefconfig without telling us. The equivalent
-no-user-config option is now used instead. Qemu also
moved the "serial" option from -drive to
-device, again without any notice, and this is also
fixed.
