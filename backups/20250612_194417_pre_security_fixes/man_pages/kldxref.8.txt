NAME

kldxref — generate
hints for the kernel loader

SYNOPSIS

kldxref
[−Rdv] [−f hintsfile]
path ...

DESCRIPTION

The kldxref utility is
used to generate hint files which list modules, their
version numbers, and the files that contain them. These
hints are used by the kernel loader to determine where to
find a particular KLD module.

A separate hint
file is generated for each directory listed on the command
line that contains modules. If no hint records are generated
for a particular directory, no hint file is created, and the
preexisting hint file (if there was one in that directory)
is removed.

The following
options are available:

−R

Recurse into
subdirectories.

−d

Do not generate
a hint file, but print module metadata on standard
output.

−f
hintsfile

Specify a different name for
the hints files than linker.hints.

−v

Operate in
verbose mode.

EXAMPLES

To build hint files for both
standard and add-on modules:

kldxref
/boot/kernel /boot/modules

To build hint
files for all installed kernels:

kldxref -R
/boot
