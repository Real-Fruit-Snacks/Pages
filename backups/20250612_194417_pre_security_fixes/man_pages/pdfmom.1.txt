Description

pdfmom
is a wrapper around groff(1) that facilitates the
production of PDF documents from files formatted with the
mom macros.

pdfmom
prints to the standard output, so output must usually be
redirected to a destination file. The size of the final PDF
can be reduced by piping the output through
ps2pdf(1).

If called with
the -Tpdf option (which is the default),
pdfmom processes files using groff’s
native PDF driver, gropdf(1). If -Tps is
given, processing is passed over to pdfroff, which
uses groff’s PostScript driver. In either case,
multiple runs of the source file are performed in order to
satisfy any forward references in the document.

pdfmom
accepts all the same options as groff. If -Tps
is given, the options associated with pdfroff are
accepted as well. When pdfmom calls pdfroff,
the options “-mpdfmark -mom --no-toc”
options are implied and should not be given on the command
line. Equally, it is not necessary to supply the -mom
or -m mom options when -Tps is
absent.

PDF integration
with the mom macros is discussed in full in the
manual “Producing PDFs with groff and
mom”, which was itself produced with
pdfmom.

If called with
the -v or --version options, pdfmom
displays its version information and exits.
