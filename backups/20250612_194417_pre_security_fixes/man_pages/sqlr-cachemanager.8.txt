NAME

sqlr-cachemanager
âˆ’ running the cache manager

SYNOPSIS

sqlr-cachemanager
interval

DESCRIPTION

Clients can
cache result sets with a time-to-live on them. The cache
manager goes through the cached result sets periodically and
removes the ones that have expired.

Run the
sqlr-cachemanager daemon to establish the cache
manager.

Only one cache
manager needs to be started per machine.

Important
Note: Since cache managers clean up after SQL Relay
clients, not servers, they need to be run on machines which
run clients that could cache result sets. These may not be
the same machines that run the sqlr-listener and
sqlr-connection daemons. If there is no SQL Relay
installation on those machines, you should create the cache
directory (/var/cache/sqlrelay), install the
sqlr-cachemanager program by itself and set it up to run at
boot time.

OPTIONS

The optional
INTERVAL argument specifies in seconds how often the cache
manager scans the result sets. Each scan is scheduled from
the end of the previous scan. If the argument is left off,
the cache manager scans at a default interval of 30
seconds.
