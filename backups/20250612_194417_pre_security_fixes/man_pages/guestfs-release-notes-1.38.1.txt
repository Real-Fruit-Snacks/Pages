RELEASE NOTES FOR LIBGUESTFS 1.38

These release
notes only cover the differences from the previous
stable/dev branch split (1.36.0). For detailed changelogs,
please see the git repository, or the ChangeLog file
distributed in the tarball.

New
features 
New tools

Virt-builder-repository
is a new tool allowing end users to create and update
virt-builder repositories (Cédric Bosdonnat).

Virt-rescue
(while not a new tool) has been substantially rewritten,
implementing job control, -m and -i options,
escape keys, etc.

New features
in existing tools

Virt-builder
planner has been improved so that faster and more efficient
build plans are chosen for complex cases, especially when
either the tmpdir or output is on networked storage.

New
virt-builder Fedora templates (starting with Fedora 26) will
have plain partition layout and use GPT for partitions.

Virt-customize
"firstboot" scripts in guests using systemd are
now installed under the "multi-user.target"
instead of "default.target" so they will only run
when the system is booted normally.

Virt-customize
now sets a random /etc/machine-id for Linux guests,
if one is not already set.

Virt-df now
works correctly on filesystems with block sizes smaller than
1K (Nikolay Ivanets).

Virt-dib has
further compatibility enhancements with diskimage-builder
(Pino Toscano).

Virt-sysprep
removes "DHCP_HOSTNAME" from ifcfg-*
files.

Virt-sysprep
now works on Oracle Linux (Jamie Iles).

Virt-resize now
correctly copies GPT partition attributes from the source to
the destination (Cédric Bosdonnat).

Bash tab
completion implemented or enhanced for: virt-win-reg,
virt-v2v-copy-to-local.

virt-v2v and
virt-p2v

Virt-v2v can
now read VMware VMX files directly, either from local disk,
NFS storage, or over SSH from an ESXi hypervisor.

Virt-v2v can
now use VDDK as an input source.

Both virt-v2v
and virt-p2v are now able to pass through the source CPU
vendor, model and topology. However unfortunately not all
source and target hypervisors are able to provide or consume
this data at present (Tomáš
Golembiovský).

Virt-v2v now
supports encrypted guests (Pino Toscano).

Virt-v2v can
now handle VMware snapshots. Note that the snapshots are
collapsed — it does not convert the chain of
snapshots into a chain of snapshots.

Virt-v2v now
installs Windows 10 / Windows Server 2016 virtio block
drivers correctly (Pavel Butsykin, Kun Wei).

Virt-v2v now
installs virtio-rng, balloon and pvpanic drivers, and
correctly sets this in the target hypervisor metadata for
hypervisors which support that (Tomáš
Golembiovský).

Virt-v2v now
installs both legacy and modern virtio keys in the Windows
registry (Ladi Prosek).

Virt-p2v can
now preserve (in some cases) the offset of the Real Time
Clock from UTC.

Virt-p2v now
combines several scp commands to the conversion server into
a single command, improving conversion times.

Virt-v2v now
detects the special Linux Xen PV-only kernels correctly
(Laszlo Ersek).

Virt-v2v -o
glance now generates the right properties for UEFI
guests (Pino Toscano).

Virt-v2v -o
null now avoids spooling the guest to a temporary file,
instead it writes to the qemu "null block device".
This makes it faster and use almost no disk space.

Virt-v2v -o
rhv now supports Windows 2016 Server guest type.

Virt-v2v -i
libvirtxml can now open network disks over http or
https.

Virt-v2v will
now give a warning about host passthrough devices (Pino
Toscano).

The virt-v2v
--machine-readable output has been enhanced so it
includes "vcenter-https", "xen-ssh" and
"in-place" facts (Pino Toscano).

Language
bindings

Fix multiple
memory leaks and other data corruption problems in the Java
bindings (Pino Toscano).

Perl
%guestfs_introspection has been dropped.

Inspection

Inspection
support was rewritten in OCaml and included inside the
daemon. This makes inspection considerably faster, more
robust and more easily extensible in future.

Better icon
support for ALT Linux guests (Pino Toscano).

Better support
for NeoKylin (Qingzheng Zhang).

Can handle OSes
like Void Linux which do not include "VERSION_ID"
in /etc/os-release (Pino Toscano).

Add support for
Microsoft MS-DOS (Daniel Berrangé).

Architectures
and platforms

Multiple fixes
for S/390 architecture. Libguestfs and all the tools should
now compile and run on this architecture.

Other

The libguestfs
API is now thread-safe (although not parallel). You can call
APIs on the same handle from multiple threads without
needing to take a lock.

Security

There were multiple vulnerabilities in the icoutils
"wrestool" program which is run by libguestfs to
create icons for Windows guests. Using the latest
"wrestool" is recommended.

API

New APIs 
"hivex_value_string"

This replaces the deprecated
"hivex_value_utf8" API, but does the same
thing.

"part_get_gpt_attributes"

"part_set_gpt_attributes"

Read and write GPT partition
attribute flags (Cédric Bosdonnat).

"part_resize"

Enlarge or shrink an existing
partition (Nikos Skalkotos).

"yara_destroy" 
"yara_load" 
"yara_scan"

Support for the Yara malware
scanning engine (Matteo Cafasso).

Other API
changes

APIs
implemented in the daemon can now be written in either C or
OCaml. Several APIs were rewritten in OCaml, although we are
not planning to rewrite all of them.

You will now
get a clear error message if you try to add too many disks
to the appliance, instead of getting a peculiar failure from
qemu.

Certain APIs
accidentally allowed you to use "/dev/urandom" as
an input "device", eg.
"g.copy_device_to_device("/dev/urandom",
"/dev/sda")". The code has been modified to
forbid this usage.

All APIs for
inspecting installer CDs have been deprecated. Use libosinfo
for this task.

Build
changes 
A working OCaml compiler ≥ 4.01 is now required for
building libguestfs. The "./configure
--disable-ocaml" option remains but is only used to
disable the OCaml language bindings.

Add
"RELEASES" file which lists release dates for each
version of libguestfs. You must update this file when making
a new release.

Documentation
generated by "gtk-doc" has been removed.
"./configure --enable-gtk-doc" now does
nothing.

Libtirpc is now
used for XDR functions and rpcgen. Note that glibc has
deprecated and in most Linux distros dropped these, so for
most people this will be an extra dependency (Martin
Kletzander).

Libxcrypt is
now used for crypt(3). This is required if using
glibc ≥ 2.27.

"ocaml-hivex"
is now required.

Libvirt ≥
1.2.20 is now required.

There is now a
"make check-root" target for tests which need to
be run as root (analogous to "make
check-slow").

"./configure"-time
check for "__attribute__((cleanup))" now works in
the cross-compilation case (Yann E. Morin).

The
"AUTHORS" and "p2v/about-authors.c"
files are now generated from a single place.

Either GnuPG v1
or v2 can be used.

"./configure
--with-guestfs-path" may be used to set the default
"LIBGUESTFS_PATH". In addition the way that the
path is searched has changed slightly so that all types of
appliances are searched in each path element separately
(Pavel Butsykin).

"GUESTFSD_EXT_CMD"
which was used to mark external commands in the daemon has
been removed. It was originally used by SUSE builds, but
they have not been using it for a while.

The output from
"./configure" is now visually grouped under
headings related to what it is doing, making it much easier
to scan (Pino Toscano).

OCaml
dependencies are now generated from a single script instead
of multiple not-quite-the-same Makefile fragments.

"./configure
--with-distro=ID" can be used to override automatic
Linux distro detection at build time (Pino Toscano).

qemu ≥ 2.10
is supported (but not required). This adds mandatory locking
to disks and libguestfs turns this off in certain
circumstances when it is known to be safe (Lars Seipel,
Peter Krempa, Daniel Berrangé, Pino Toscano, Fam
Zheng, Yongkui Guo, Václav Kadlčík).

Internals

Most common code has been moved to the common/
subdirectory, with OCaml common code being in
common/ml* directories (eg. common/visit and
common/mlvisit contain the visitor library in C and
OCaml respectively). The mllib directory has been
deleted and replaced by common/mltools.

There is now a
lightweight OCaml binding for PCRE, see
common/mlpcre. Use of OCaml "Str" library
has been mostly replaced with PCRE.

Add more calls
to "udev_settle" to improve stability of partition
code (Dawid Zamirski).

Run
"udev_settle" with --exit-if-exists option,
which improves the speed of this command (Pavel
Butsykin).

Detect new
locations of major(3), minor(3),
makedev(3).

Actions can now
be deprecated with no suggested replacement, for APIs such
as "guestfs_wait_ready" that should simply be
removed from client code.

Use gnulib
"set_nonblocking_flag" wrapper instead of calling
fcntl(2) with "O_NONBLOCK" (Eric Blake).
Similarly "set_cloexec_flag".

Fix memory leak
in XFS version of "guestfs_vfs_minimum_size" (Pino
Toscano).

Valgrind checks
now run on the virt-p2v binary.

Unicode single
quotes ("’’") and now used in place of
'' or `' throughout the code and documentation. Similarly
for "’s" instead of "'s".

The
"is_zero" function has been reimplemented for
greater speed (Eric Blake).

In the direct
backend, virtio-blk support has been removed. Virtio-scsi is
now the only supported way to add disks.

Generator
string parameter and return types have been rationalised so
there are only two types ("String",
"StringList") with many subtypes eg.
"FileIn" becomes "String (FileIn,
...)".

The appliance
disk image can now be in formats other than raw (Pavel
Butsykin).

Multiple
improvements to how we automatically build Debian templates
for virt-builder (Pino Toscano). Enable serial console for
these templates (Florian Klink).

In the daemon,
instead of making a private copy of lvm.conf and modifying
it (eg for filters), start with an empty file since LVM
understands that to mean "all defaults" (Alasdair
Kergon, Zdenek Kabelac).

The
"direct" backend can now run QMP queries against
the QEMU binary, enhancing the kinds of information we can
detect. In addition the code to query QEMU has been made
more robust for handling multiple parallel queries of
different versions of QEMU.

OCaml Augeas
bindings are bundled under common/mlaugeas. The long
term plan is to remove this and use system ocaml-augeas when
it is more widely available in distros (Pino Toscano).

All OCaml
modules ("*.ml" files) are now required to have an
interface file ("*.mli"). If they don’t
export anything then the interface will be empty except for
comments.

Certain OCaml
features in OCaml ≥ 4.01 are used throughout the code,
including replacing ’{ field = field }’ with
’{ field }’.

Virt-builder
"make-template" utility now uses the
"virt-install --transient" option so that we
should never need to clean up left over domains after a
crash. It also saves kickstarts and virt-install commands,
which are committed to git for future reference.

/dev/shm
is now created in the appliance (Nicolas Hicher).

In verbose mode
on Fedora guests, virt-customize will now use "dnf
--verbose" enabling better debugging output.

Virt-v2v input
and output classes now contain a "#precheck"
method which is used to perform environmental checks before
conversion starts.

Virt-p2v
enables miniexpect debugging. It is written to stderr (of
virt-p2v).

Virt-v2v free
space checks are more liberal especially for smaller guests
(Pino Toscano).
