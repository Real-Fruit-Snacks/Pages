NAME

PCRE2 -
Perl-compatible regular expressions (revised API)

SYNOPSIS

#include

void
pcre2_jit_free_unused_memory(pcre2_general_context
*gcontext);

DESCRIPTION

This function
frees unused JIT executable memory. The argument is a
general context, for custom memory management, or NULL for
standard memory management. JIT memory allocation retains
some memory in order to improve future JIT compilation
speed. In low memory conditions,
pcre2_jit_free_unused_memory() can be used to cause
this memory to be freed.

There is a
complete description of the PCRE2 native API in the
pcre2api page and a description of the POSIX API in
the pcre2posix page.
