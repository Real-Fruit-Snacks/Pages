NAME

customizable_types
- The SELinux customizable types configuration file

DESCRIPTION

The
customizable_types file contains a list of types that
can be customised in some way by SELinux-aware
applications.

Generally this
is a file context type that is usually set on files that
need to be shared among certain domains and where the
administrator wants to manually manage the type.

The use of
customizable types is deprecated as the preferred approach
is to use semanage(8) fcontext(8)
...(8). However, SELinux-aware applications such as
setfiles(8) will use this information to obtain a
list of types relating to files that should not be
relabeled.

selinux_customizable_types_path(3)
will return the active policy path to this file. The default
customizable types file is:

/etc/selinux/{SELINUXTYPE}/contexts/customizable_types

Where
{SELINUXTYPE} is the entry from the selinux
configuration file config (see
selinux_config(5)).

is_context_customizable(3)
reads this file to determine if a context is customisable or
not for the active policy.

FILE FORMAT

Each line in
the file consists of the following:

type

Where:

type

The type defined in the policy
that can be customised.

EXAMPLE

#
./contexts/customizable_types 
mount_loopback_t
