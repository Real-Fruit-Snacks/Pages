FATM(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual FATM(4)

NAME

fatm — device
driver for Fore PCA200E ATM interfaces

SYNOPSIS

device fatm 
device utopia 
device atm

options
NATM

DESCRIPTION

The fatm device driver
supports the FORE (now Marconi) PCA200E ATM interface cards.
The driver interfaces with the natm(4) framework,
netgraph(4) and HARP. It provides only PVC services.
Signalling, ATMARP, ILMI and other higher layer protocols
are implemented using netgraph(4) or HARP.

For configuring
the card for IP see natmip(4). The following sysctls are
recognized by the driver additionally to those handled by
utopia(4):

hw.atm.fatmN.stats

Returns a device specific
statistic list of uint32_t statistic counters.

hw.atm.fatmN.istats

Returns a list of
uint32_t with internal driver statistics.

hw.atm.fatmN.retry_tx

If this is set packets are
stuffed back into the interface’s send queue when the
cards transmit queue is found to be full. They are
transmitted later. If this is not set the packets are
dropped. It may be useful to set this if only UBR traffic is
sent.

hw.atm.fatmN.debug

(Only if debugging
enabled.) These are debugging flags. See
src/sys/dev/fatm/if_fatmvar.h for the possible
flags.

The driver
supports the media options sdh, noscramb and
unassigned (see utopia(4)).

BUGS

These cards can CBR shape a
single VCC only. It is currently possible to request more
than one CBR connection. In this case all the timing will be
wrong. See hatm(4) for a better card.
