NAME

fducmd, fdu
− display the number of disk blocks used per directory
or file

SYNOPSIS

fducmd [
−s ] [ −a ] [ −r ] [
filename ... ]

fdu [
−s ] [ −a ] [ −r ] [
filename ... ]

DESCRIPTION

fdu
gives the number of kilobytes contained in all files and,
recursively, directories within each specified directory or
file filename. If filename is missing,
’.’ (the current directory) is used.

OPTIONS

−s

Only display the grand total for
each of the specified filenames.

−a

Generate an entry for each file. Entries are generated
only for each directory in the absence of this option.

−r

Recursively go down in the directory tree and show
deeper entries, too. In absence of this option the deeper
directory tree branches are only counted belonging to their
parent in the top level directory.

fducmd
will perform csh file name globbing based on file and
directory information obtained from the FSP database.

Since
user’s command shells generally cannot do the proper
globbing for this program, it is recommended that user
defines a shell alias or function to turn off command shell
globbing before running this program. csh
example:

alias fdu \(set
noglob\; exec fducmd \!\*\)

ENVIRONMENT

See fsp_env(7)
for list of used environment variables.
