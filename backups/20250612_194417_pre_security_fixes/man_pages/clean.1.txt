DESCRIPTION

This manual
page documents briefly the smarteiffel,
se-compile, compile_to_c, compile_to_jvm, clean, finder,
pretty, print_jvm_class, short and smarteiffel.sh
commands. This manual page was written for the Debian
GNU/Linux distribution (but may be used by others), because
the original program does not have a manual page. Instead,
it has documentation in HTML format, which may be browsed
through dwww; see below.

smarteiffel
is a set of programs that compile and manage programs
written in the Eiffel language. When using them, the

/usr/lib/smarteiffel. A summary of options are included
below. For a complete description, see the HTML
documentation. 
smarteiffel.sh

A shell script presenting a
menu for greater convenience in editing and compiling Eiffel
code.

compile a set of Eiffel classes
into an executable program.

compile_to_c [options]
root_class [root_procedure] [*.c] [*.o] [-l*]

compile a set of Eiffel classes
into C code.

compile_to_jvm [options]
root_class [root_procedure]

compile a set of Eiffel classes
into Java code.

clean [-verbose] root_class
...

Removes all intermediate files
produced by a previous compilation.

finder class

Find an Eiffel class using the
current search path.

pretty [options] class_name
...

Formats Eiffel source code
