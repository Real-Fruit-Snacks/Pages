NAME

quorum_fd_get -
Dispatches callbacks from the quorum service

SYNOPSIS

#include

int
quorum_fd_get(quorum_handle_t handle, int
*fd);

DESCRIPTION

The
quorum_fd_get function is used to retrieve the file
descriptor that may be used with the poll system call to
determine when quorum_dispatch(3) wonâ€™t block.
The handle argument may not be used directly with
poll because it is not the file descriptor, but
instead an internal identifier used by the quorum
library.

RETURN VALUE

This call
returns the CS_OK value if successful, otherwise an error is
returned.

CS_ERR_TRY_AGAIN
