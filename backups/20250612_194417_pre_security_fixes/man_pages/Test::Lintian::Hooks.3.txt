NAME
       Test::Lintian::Hooks -- hook routines for the test runners

SYNOPSIS
         use Test::Lintian::Hooks qw(sed_hook);
         sed_hook('script.sed', 'input.file');

DESCRIPTION
       Various hook routines for the test runners.

FUNCTIONS
       sed_hook(SCRIPT, SUBJECT, OUTPUT)
           Runs the parser sed on file SUBJECT using the instructions in
           SCRIPT and places the result in the file OUTPUT.

       sort_lines(UNSORTED, SORTED)
           Sorts the file UNSORTED line by line and places the result into the
           file SORTED.

       calibrate(SCRIPT, ACTUAL, EXPECTED, CALIBRATED)
           Executes calibration script SCRIPT with the three arguments
           EXPECTED, ACTUAL and CALIBRATED, all of which are file paths.
           Please note that the order of arguments in this function
           corresponds to the bookkeeping logic of ACTUAL vs EXPECTED. The
           order for the script is different.

       find_missing_prerequisites(TEST_CASE)
           Returns a string with missing dependencies, if applicable, that
           would be necessary to run the test described by hash DESC.
