XML::XPathEngine::NumbUserpContributed Perl DocumXML::XPathEngine::Number(3pm)

NAME
       XML::XPathEngine::Number - Simple numeric values.

DESCRIPTION
       This class holds simple numeric values. It doesn't support -0, +/-
       Infinity, or NaN, as the XPath spec says it should, but I'm not hurting
       anyone I don't think.

API
   new($num)
       Creates a new XML::XPathEngine::Number object, with the value in $num.
       Does some rudimentary numeric checking on $num to ensure it actually is
       a number.

   value()
       Also as overloaded stringification. Returns the numeric value held.
