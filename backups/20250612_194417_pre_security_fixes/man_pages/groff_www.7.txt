Synopsis

groff -m www

[option ...]
[file ...] 

Description

This manual
page describes the GNU www macro package, which is
part of the groff(7) document formatting system. This
macro file is automatically loaded by the default
troffrc file when the formatter (usually
groff(1)) is called with either of the options
-Thtml or -Txhtml. To see hyperlinks in
action, format this man page using one of those options.

This document
is a basic guide; the HTML output driver (grohtml)
remains in an alpha state. It has been included with the
distribution to encourage testing.

Here is a
summary of the functions found in this macro set.

Macros

.JOBNAME
filename

Split output into multiple HTML
files. A file is split whenever a .SH or .NH 1 is
encountered. Its argument is the file stem name for future
output files. This option is equivalent to
grohtml’s -j option.

.HX n

Specify the cut off depth when generating links from
section headings. For example, a parameter of 2 would
cause grohtml to generate a list of links for
.NH 1 and .NH 2 but not for
.NH 3. Whereas

.HX 0

tells
grohtml that no heading links should be created at
all. Another method for turning automatic headings off is by
issuing the command-line switch -P-l to
groff.

.BCL foreground
background active not-visited visited

This macro takes five
parameters: foreground, background, active hypertext link,
hypertext link not yet visited, and visited hypertext link
colour.

.BGIMG imagefile

the only parameter to this
macro is the background image file.

.URL url [description]
[after]

generates a URL using either
one, two, or three arguments. The first parameter is the
actual URL, the second is the name of the link, and the
third is optional stuff to be printed immediately
afterwards. If description and after are
absent then the URL becomes the anchor text.
Hyphenation is disabled while printing the actual URL;
explicit breakpoints should be inserted with the \:
escape sequence. Here is how to encode
http://foo.org/">foo:

.URL
http://\:foo\:.org/ foo :

If this is
processed by a device other than -Thtml or
-Txhtml it appears as:

foo ⟨
http://foo.org⟩ :

The URL macro
can be of any type; for example, we can reference
Eric Raymond’s pic guide
by:

.URL
pic\:.html "Eric Raymond's pic guide"

.MTO address [description]
[after]

Generate an email HTML
reference. The first argument is mandatory as the email
address. The optional second argument is the text you see in
your browser. If an empty argument is given, address
is used instead. An optional third argument is stuff printed
immediately afterwards. Hyphenation is disabled while
printing the actual email address. For example,
joe [AT] user.org">Joe User can be achieved
by the following macro:

.MTO
joe [AT] user.org "Joe User"

All URLs
currently are treated as consuming no textual space in
groff. This could be considered as a bug since it
causes some problems. To circumvent this, www.tmac
inserts a zero-width character which expands to a harmless
space (only if run with -Thtml or
-Txhtml).

.FTP url [description]
[after]

indicates that data can be
obtained via FTP. The first argument is the URL and the
second is the browser text. A third argument, similar to the
macros above, is intended for stuff printed immediately
afterwards. The second and the third parameter are optional.
Hyphenation is disabled while printing the actual URL. As an
example, here is the location of the
ftp://ftp.gnu.org/">GNU FTP server. The macro
example above can be specified as:

.FTP
ftp://\:ftp\:.gnu\:.org/ "GNU FTP server"
.

.TAG name

Generates an HTML name tag from
its argument. This can then be referenced using the
URL macro. As you can see, you must
precede the tag name with # since it is a local
reference. This link was achieved via placing a TAG in the
URL description above; the source looks like this:

.TP 
.B URL 
generates 
.TAG URL 
a URL using either two or three arguments. 
...

.IMG [-R|-L|-C] filename
[width] [height]

Include a picture into the
document. The first argument is the horizontal location:
right, left, or center (-R, -L, or -C).
Alignment is centered by default (-C). The second
argument is the filename. The optional third and fourth
arguments are the width and height. If the width is absent
it defaults to 1 inch. If the height is absent it
defaults to the width. This maps onto an HTML img tag. If
you are including a PNG image then it is advisable to use
the PIMG macro.

.PIMG [-R|-L|-C] filename
[width [height]]

Include an image in PNG format.
This macro takes exactly the same parameters as the
IMG macro; it has the advantage of working with
PostScript and HTML devices also since it can automatically
convert the image into the EPS format, using the following
programs of the netpbm package: pngtopnm,
pnmcrop, and pnmtops. If the document
isn’t processed with -Thtml or -Txhtml
it is necessary to use the -U option of
groff.

.MPIMG [-R|-L] [-G gap]
filename [width [height]]

Place a PNG image on the margin
and wrap text around it. The first parameters are optional.
The alignment: left or right (-L or -R)
specifies the margin where the picture is placed at. The
default alignment is left (-L). Optionally,
-G gap can be used to arrange a gap
between the picture and the text that wraps around it. The
default gap width is zero. 
The first non-optional argument is the filename. The
optional following arguments are the width and height. If
the width is absent it defaults to 1 inch. If the
height is absent it defaults to the width. Example:

.MPIMG -L -G 2c
foo.png 3c 1.5c

The height and
width may also be given as percentages. The PostScript
device calculates the width from the .l register and
the height from the .p register. For example:

.MPIMG -L -G 2c
foo.png 15%

.HnS n

Begin heading. The numeric heading level n is
specified by the first parameter. Use this macro if your
headings contain URL, FTP or MTO macros. Example:

.HnS 1 
.HR 
GNU Troff 
.URL https://\:www\:.gnu\:.org/\:software/\:groff/ 
\[em]a 
.URL http://www\:.gnu\:.org/ GNU 
project. 
.HR 
.HnE

In this case
you might wish to disable automatic links to headings. This
can be done via -P-l from the command line.

.HnE

End heading.

.LK

Force grohtml to place the automatically
generated links at this position.

.HR

Generate a full-width horizontal rule for -Thtml
and -Txhtml. No effect for all other devices.

.NHR

Suppress generation of the top and bottom rules which
grohtml emits by default.

.HTL

Generate an HTML title only. This differs from the
TL macro of the ms macro package which
generates both an HTML title and an  heading. Use
it to provide an HTML title as search engine fodder but a
graphic title in the document. The macro terminates when a
space or break is seen (.sp, .br).

.HEAD

Add arbitrary HTML data to the  block.
Ignored if not processed with -Thtml or
-Txhtml. Example:

.HEAD
"
rel=""icon"" \ 
type=""image/png"" \ 

href="""">http://foo.org//bar.png""/>"

.HTML

All text after this macro is
treated as raw HTML. If the document is processed without
-Thtml or -Txhtml then the macro is ignored.
Internally, this macro is used as a building block for other
higher-level macros.

For example,
the BGIMG macro is defined as

.de BGIMG 
. HTML  
..

.DC l text [color]

Produce a drop capital. The
first parameter is the letter to be dropped and enlarged,
the second parameter text is the adjoining text whose
height the first letter should not exceed. The optional
third parameter is the color of the dropped letter. It
defaults to black.

.CDS

Start displaying a code section in constant width
font. 

.CDE

End code display

.ALN [color]
[percentage]

Place section heading links
automatically to the left of the main text. The color
argument is optional and if present indicates which HTML
background color is to be used under the links. The optional
percentage indicates the amount of width to devote to
displaying the links. The default values are #eeeeee and 30
for color and percentage width, respectively. This macro
should only be called once at the beginning of the document.
After calling this macro each section heading emits an HTML
table consisting of the links in the left and the section
text on the right.

.LNS

Start a new two-column table with links in the left
column. This can be called if the document has text before
the first .SH and if .ALN is used. Typically this is called
just before the first paragraph and after the main title as
it indicates that text after this point should be positioned
to the right of the left-hand navigational links.

.LNE

End a two-column table. This should be called at the end
of the document if .ALN was used.

.LINKSTYLE color [ fontstyle
[ openglyph closeglyph ] ]

Initialize default URL
attributes to be used if this macro set is not used with the
HTML device. The macro set initializes itself with the
following call

.LINKSTYLE blue
CR \[la] \[ra]

but these
values will be superseded by a user call to LINKSTYLE.

Section heading links

By default
grohtml generates links to all section headings and
places these at the top of the HTML document. (See
LINKS for details of how to switch this
off or alter the position).

Limitations of grohtml

tbl(1)
tables are rendered as PNG images. Paul DuBois’s
approach with tblcvt(1), part of the
http://www.snake.net/software/troffcvt/">troffcvt
distribution, should be explored.
