SYNOPSIS

#include

int
getseuserbyname(const char *linuxuser, char
**selinuxuser, char
**level);

DESCRIPTION

getseuserbyname()
retrieves the SELinux username and security level associated
with a given Linux username. The SELinux username and
security level can then be passed to other libselinux
functions such as
get_ordered_context_list_with_level(3) and
get_default_context_with_level(3).

The returned
SELinux username and level should be freed by the caller
using free.

RETURN VALUE

On success, 0
is returned. On failure, -1 is returned and errno is
set appropriately.

The errors
documented for the stat(2) system call are also
applicable here.
