NAME

ctrlproxyrc
− Configuration file for ctrlproxy

DESCRIPTION

Ctrlproxy uses
an XML file for configuration. Check the ctrlproxyrc.example
file for a good example. There are a few so−called
’sections’ in the file that are discussed
below.

plugins

This section contains a list of all the plugins that are to
be loaded. A  tag specifies a plugin. The
’file’ attribute specifies the location the
plugin can be found. Additional attributes or child elements
can be specified, depending on the plugin.

networks

This section contains a list of all the servers to join. The
 element supports the attributes: nick,
username, fullname, type, pass.

pass contains
the password to join the server. client_pass contains the
password any client that connects to the proxy should
send.

The
 element supports the child element
. Attributes of this element are name
(indicating the name of the channel) and autojoin (whether
or not to join the channel on start).

Each
 element contains a  element
which contains several transport−specific elements.
The standard ’socket’ module provides the
transports ’ipv4’, ’ipv6’ and
’pipe’.
