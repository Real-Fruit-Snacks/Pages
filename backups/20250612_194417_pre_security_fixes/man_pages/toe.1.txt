NAME

toe -
list table of entries of terminfo terminal types

SYNOPSIS

toe
[-ahs] [-v [n]] [directory
...]

toe
[-u|-U] file

toe
-V

DESCRIPTION

toe
reports to the standard output stream the (primary) names
and descriptions of the terminal types available to the
terminfo library. Each directory is scanned;
if none are given, toe scans the default
terminfo directory.

OPTIONS

The -h
option can be helpful to observe where toe is looking
for terminal descriptions. Other options support maintainers
of terminfo terminal descriptions.

-a

lists entries from all terminal database directories
that terminfo would search, instead of only the first
that it finds.

If -s is
also given, toe additionally reports, like
conflict(1), which entries correspond to a given
terminal database. An “*” marks entries that
differ, and “+” marks equivalent entries.

Without the
-s option, toe does not attempt to merge
duplicates in its report.

-h

writes a heading naming each
each directory as it is accessed.

-s

sorts the output by the entry names.

-u file

lists terminal type dependencies in file, a
terminfo entry source or termcap database
file. The report summarizes the “use”
(terminfo) and tc (termcap) relations:
each line comprises the primary name of a terminal type
employing use/tc capabilities, a colon, a
space- and tab-separated list of primary names of terminal
types thus named, and a newline.

-U file

lists terminal type reverse dependencies in file,
a terminfo entry source or termcap database
file. The report summarizes the “use”
(terminfo) and tc (termcap) reverse
relations: each line comprises the primary name of a
terminal type occurring in use/tc
capabilities, a colon, a space- and tab-separated list of
primary names of terminal types naming them thus, and a
newline. 

-v [n]

reports verbose status information to the standard error
stream, showing toe’s progress.

The optional
parameter n is an integer between 1 and 10 inclusive,
interpreted as for tic(1). If ncurses is built
without tracing support, n is ignored.

-V

reports the version of
ncurses associated with this program and exits with a
successful status.

FILES

/etc/terminfo

compiled terminal description
database

PORTABILITY

toe is
not provided by other implementations. There is no
applicable X/Open or POSIX standard for it.

HISTORY

toe
replaces a -T option that was briefly supported by
the ncurses infocmp utility in 1995.

The -a
and -s options were added in 2006 and 2011,
respectively.

The
program’s name originates with a developer’s
pun:

•

tic,

•

tac (now tack),

•

toe.

EXAMPLES

When not
sorting with the -s option, the -a option
reports all of the names found in all of the terminal
database directories named in the TERMINFO and
TERMINFO_DIRS environment variables.

Use the
-a and -s options together to show where each
terminal description was found.
