NAME

lint âˆ’ C
program verifier

SYNOPSIS

/usr/ucb/lint
[options]

DESCRIPTION

/usr/ucb/lint
is the interface to the BSD Compatibility Package C program
verifier. It is a script that looks for the link
/usr/ccs/bin/ucblint to the C program verifier.
/usr/ccs/bin/ucblint is available only with the
SPROcc package, whose default location is
/opt/SUNWspro. /usr/ucb/lint is identical to
/usr/ccs/bin/ucblint, except that BSD headers are
used and BSD libraries are linked before base
libraries. The /opt/SUNWspro/man/man1/lint.1 man page
is available only with the SPROcc package.

OPTIONS

/usr/ucb/lint
accepts the same options as /usr/ccs/bin/ucblint,
with the following exceptions:

-Idir

Search dir for included files whose names do not
begin with a slash (/) prior to searching the usual
directories. The directories for multiple -I options
are searched in the order specified. The preprocessor first
searches for #include files in the directory
containing sourcefile, and then in directories named
with -I options (if any), then
/usr/ucbinclude, and finally, in
/usr/include. 

-Ldir

Add dir to the list of directories searched for
libraries by /usr/ccs/bin/ucblint. This option is
passed to /usr/ccs/bin/ld. Directories specified with
this option are searched before /usr/ucblib and
/usr/lib. 

-Y P, dir

Change the default directory
used for finding libraries.

EXIT STATUS

The following
exit values are returned:

0

Successful completion.

>0

An error occurred.
