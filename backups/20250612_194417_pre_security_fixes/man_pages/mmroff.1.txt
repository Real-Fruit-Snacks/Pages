Description

mmroff
is a simple wrapper for groff, used to expand cross
references in mm; see groff_mm(7). It runs
groff with the -mm option twice, first with
-z and -rRef=1 to populate cross-reference and
index files with their corresponding entries, and then again
to produce the document. It also handles the inclusion of
PostScript images with the PIC macro. Documents that
do not use these features of groff mm (the
INITI, IND, INDP, INITR,
SETR, GETHN, GETPN, GETR,
GETST, and PIC macros) do not require
mmroff.

Options

--help
displays a usage message, while --version shows
version information; both exit afterward.

-x

Create or update the cross-reference file and exit.
