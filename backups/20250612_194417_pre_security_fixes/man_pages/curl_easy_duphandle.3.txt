NAME

curl_easy_duphandle
- Clone a libcurl session handle

SYNOPSIS

#include

CURL
*curl_easy_duphandle(CURL *handle);

DESCRIPTION

This function
will return a new curl handle, a duplicate, using all the
options previously set in the input curl handle. Both
handles can subsequently be used independently and they must
both be freed with curl_easy_cleanup(3).

All strings
that the input handle has been told to point to (as opposed
to copy) with previous calls to curl_easy_setopt(3)
using char * inputs, will be pointed to by the new handle as
well. You must therefore make sure to keep the data around
until both handles have been cleaned up.

The new handle
will not inherit any state information, no
connections, no SSL sessions and no cookies. It also will
not inherit any share object states or options (it will be
made as if CURLOPT_SHARE(3) was set to NULL).

In
multi-threaded programs, this function must be called in a
synchronous way, the input handle may not be in use when
cloned.

RETURN VALUE

If this
function returns NULL, something went wrong and no valid
handle was returned.
