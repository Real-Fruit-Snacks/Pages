syscalls -
Linux system calls

SYNOPSIS

Linux system
calls.

DESCRIPTION

The system call
is the fundamental interface between an application and the
Linux kernel.

System calls
and library wrapper functions 
System calls are generally not invoked directly, but rather
via wrapper functions in glibc (or perhaps some other
library). For details of direct invocation of a system call,
see intro(2). Often, but not always, the name of the
wrapper function is the same as the name of the system call
that it invokes. For example, glibc contains a function
chdir() which invokes the underlying
"chdir" system call.

Often the glibc
wrapper function is quite thin, doing little work other than
copying arguments to the right registers before invoking the
system call, and then setting errno appropriately
after the system call has returned. (These are the same
steps that are performed by syscall(2), which can be
used to invoke system calls for which no wrapper function is
provided.) Note: system calls indicate a failure by
returning a negative error number to the caller on
architectures without a separate error register/flag, as
noted in syscall(2); when this happens, the wrapper
function negates the returned error number (to make it
positive), copies it to errno, and returns -1 to the
caller of the wrapper.

Sometimes,
however, the wrapper function does some extra work before
invoking the system call. For example, nowadays there are
(for reasons described below) two related system calls,
truncate(2) and truncate64(2), and the glibc
truncate() wrapper function checks which of those
system calls are provided by the kernel and determines which
should be employed.

System call
list 
Below is a list of the Linux system calls. In the list, the
Kernel column indicates the kernel version for those
system calls that were new in Linux 2.2, or have appeared
since that kernel version. Note the following points:

*

Where no kernel version is indicated, the system call
appeared in kernel 1.0 or earlier.

*

Where a system call is marked "1.2" this means
the system call probably appeared in a 1.1.x kernel version,
and first appeared in a stable kernel with 1.2. (Development
of the 1.2 kernel was initiated from a branch of kernel
1.0.6 via the 1.1.x unstable kernel series.)

*

Where a system call is marked "2.0" this means
the system call probably appeared in a 1.3.x kernel version,
and first appeared in a stable kernel with 2.0. (Development
of the 2.0 kernel was initiated from a branch of kernel
1.2.x, somewhere around 1.2.10, via the 1.3.x unstable
kernel series.)

*

Where a system call is marked "2.2" this means
the system call probably appeared in a 2.1.x kernel version,
and first appeared in a stable kernel with 2.2.0.
(Development of the 2.2 kernel was initiated from a branch
of kernel 2.0.21 via the 2.1.x unstable kernel series.)

*

Where a system call is marked "2.4" this means
the system call probably appeared in a 2.3.x kernel version,
and first appeared in a stable kernel with 2.4.0.
(Development of the 2.4 kernel was initiated from a branch
of kernel 2.2.8 via the 2.3.x unstable kernel series.)

*

Where a system call is marked "2.6" this means
the system call probably appeared in a 2.5.x kernel version,
and first appeared in a stable kernel with 2.6.0.
(Development of kernel 2.6 was initiated from a branch of
kernel 2.4.15 via the 2.5.x unstable kernel series.)

*

Starting with kernel 2.6.0, the development model
changed, and new system calls may appear in each 2.6.x
release. In this case, the exact version number where the
system call appeared is shown. This convention continues
with the 3.x kernel series, which followed on from kernel
2.6.39; and the 4.x kernel series, which followed on from
kernel 3.19; and the 5.x kernel series, which followed on
from kernel 4.20.

*

In some cases, a system call was added to a stable
kernel series after it branched from the previous stable
kernel series, and then backported into the earlier stable
kernel series. For example some system calls that appeared
in 2.6.x were also backported into a 2.4.x release after
2.4.15. When this is so, the version where the system call
appeared in both of the major kernel series is listed.

The list of
system calls that are available as at kernel 5.9 (or in a
few cases only on older kernels) is as follows:

On many
platforms, including x86-32, socket calls are all
multiplexed (via glibc wrapper functions) through
socketcall(2) and similarly System V IPC calls
are multiplexed through ipc(2).

Although slots
are reserved for them in the system call table, the
following system calls are not implemented in the standard
kernel: afs_syscall(2), break(2),
ftime(2), getpmsg(2), gtty(2),
idle(2), lock(2), madvise1(2),
mpx(2), phys(2), prof(2),
profil(2), putpmsg(2), security(2),
stty(2), tuxcall(2), ulimit(2), and
vserver(2) (see also unimplemented(2)).
However, ftime(3), profil(3), and
ulimit(3) exist as library routines. The slot for
phys(2) is in use since kernel 2.1.116 for
umount(2); phys(2) will never be implemented.
The getpmsg(2) and putpmsg(2) calls are for
kernels patched to support STREAMS, and may never be in the
standard kernel.

There was
briefly set_zone_reclaim(2), added in Linux 2.6.13,
and removed in 2.6.16; this system call was never available
to user space.

NOTES

Roughly
speaking, the code belonging to the system call with number
__NR_xxx defined in /usr/include/asm/unistd.h can be
found in the Linux kernel source in the routine
sys_xxx(). There are many exceptions, however, mostly
because older system calls were superseded by newer ones,
and this has been treated somewhat unsystematically. On
platforms with proprietary operating-system emulation, such
as sparc, sparc64, and alpha, there are many additional
system calls; mips64 also contains a full set of 32-bit
system calls.

Over time,
changes to the interfaces of some system calls have been
necessary. One reason for such changes was the need to
increase the size of structures or scalar values passed to
the system call. Because of these changes, certain
architectures (notably, longstanding 32-bit architectures
such as i386) now have various groups of related system
calls (e.g., truncate(2) and truncate64(2))
which perform similar tasks, but which vary in details such
as the size of their arguments. (As noted earlier,
applications are generally unaware of this: the glibc
wrapper functions do some work to ensure that the right
system call is invoked, and that ABI compatibility is
preserved for old binaries.) Examples of systems calls that
exist in multiple versions are the following:

*

By now there are three different
versions of stat(2): sys_stat() (slot
__NR_oldstat), sys_newstat() (slot
__NR_stat), and sys_stat64() (slot
__NR_stat64), with the last being the most current. A
similar story applies for lstat(2) and
fstat(2). 

*

Similarly, the defines __NR_oldolduname,
__NR_olduname, and __NR_uname refer to the
routines sys_olduname(), sys_uname() and
sys_newuname(). 

*

In Linux 2.0, a new version of vm86(2) appeared,
with the old and the new kernel routines being named
sys_vm86old() and sys_vm86().

*

In Linux 2.4, a new version of getrlimit(2)
appeared, with the old and the new kernel routines being
named sys_old_getrlimit() (slot
__NR_getrlimit) and sys_getrlimit() (slot
__NR_ugetrlimit). 

*

Linux 2.4 increased the size of user and group IDs from
16 to 32 bits. To support this change, a range of system
calls were added (e.g., chown32(2),
getuid32(2), getgroups32(2),
setresuid32(2)), superseding earlier calls of the
same name without the "32" suffix.

*

Linux 2.4 added support for applications on 32-bit
architectures to access large files (i.e., files for which
the sizes and file offsets canâ€™t be represented in 32
bits.) To support this change, replacements were required
for system calls that deal with file offsets and sizes. Thus
the following system calls were added: fcntl64(2),
getdents64(2), stat64(2), statfs64(2),
truncate64(2), and their analogs that work with file
descriptors or symbolic links. These system calls supersede
the older system calls which, except in the case of the
"stat" calls, have the same name without the
"64" suffix.

On newer
platforms that only have 64-bit file access and 32-bit
UIDs/GIDs (e.g., alpha, ia64, s390x, x86-64), there is just
a single version of the UID/GID and file access system
calls. On platforms (typically, 32-bit platforms) where the
*64 and *32 calls exist, the other versions are
obsolete.

*

The rt_sig* calls were
added in kernel 2.2 to support the addition of real-time
signals (see signal(7)). These system calls supersede
the older system calls of the same name without the
"rt_" prefix.

*

The select(2) and mmap(2) system calls use
five or more arguments, which caused problems in the way
argument passing on the i386 used to be set up. Thus, while
other architectures have sys_select() and
sys_mmap() corresponding to __NR_select and
__NR_mmap, on i386 one finds old_select() and
old_mmap() (routines that use a pointer to an
argument block) instead. These days passing five arguments
is not a problem any more, and there is a
__NR__newselect that corresponds directly to
sys_select() and similarly __NR_mmap2. s390x
is the only 64-bit architecture that has
old_mmap(). 

Architecture-specific
details: Alpha

*

getxgid(2) returns a pair
of GID and effective GID via registers r0 and
r20; it is provided instead of getgid(2) and
getegid(2). 

*

getxpid(2) returns a pair of PID and parent PID
via registers r0 and r20; it is provided
instead of getpid(2) and getppid(2).

*

old_adjtimex(2) is a variant of
adjtimex(2) that uses struct timeval32, for
compatibility with OSF/1.

*

getxuid(2) returns a pair of GID and effective
GID via registers r0 and r20; it is provided
instead of getuid(2) and geteuid(2).

*

sethae(2) is used for configuring the Host
Address Extension register on low-cost Alphas in order to
access address space beyond first 27 bits.
