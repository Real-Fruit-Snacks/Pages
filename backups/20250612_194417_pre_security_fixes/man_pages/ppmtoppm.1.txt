NAME

ppmtoppm - copy
PPM image

SYNOPSIS

ppmtoppm

DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

ppmtoppm
simply copies a PPM image from Standard Input to Standard
Output. This may seem an unnecessary duplication of
cat, but remember that a PPM program can read a PBM
or PGM image, and the right kind of PAM, as if it were PPM.
So ppmtoppm can read either a PBM, PGM, or PPM image
and produce a PPM image as output.

Even that is of
limited usefulness because of the fact that almost any
program to which you would feed the resulting PPM image
could also just take the original image directly. However,
sometimes you really need a true PPM image.

When you know
you have a PGM image and want a PPM image, pgmtoppm
is a more general way to do that conversion. When you know
you have a PBM image, use that and pbmtopgm.

OPTIONS
