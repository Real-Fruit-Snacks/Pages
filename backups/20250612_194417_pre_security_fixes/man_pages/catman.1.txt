CATMAN(1) BSD General Commands Manual CATMAN(1)

NAME

catman — preformat
man pages

SYNOPSIS

catman
[−fnrvL] [directories ...]

DESCRIPTION

The catman utility
preformats all the man pages in directories using the
nroff −man command. Directories may be
separated by colons instead of spaces. If no
directories are specified, the contents of the
MANPATH environment variable is used, or if that is not set,
the default directory /usr/share/man is
processed.

The options are
as follows:

−f

Force all man
pages to be reformatted even if the corresponding cat page
is newer.

−L

Process only
localized subdirectories corresponding to the locale
specified in the standard environment variables.

−n

Print out what
would be done instead of performing any formatting.

−r

Scan for and
remove ’’junk’’ files that are
neither man pages nor their corresponding formatted cat
pages.

−v

Cause
catman to be more verbose about what it is doing.

ENVIRONMENT 
LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, LANG

These variables control what
subdirectories will be processed if the −L
option is used.

MANPATH

Determines the
set of directories to be processed if none are given on the
command line.

FILES 
/usr/share/man

Default
directory to process if the MANPATH environment variable is
not set.

DIAGNOSTICS

The catman utility
exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error
occurs.
