NAME

nfsmount.conf -
Configuration file for NFS mounts

SYNOPSIS

Configuration
file for NFS mounts that allows options to be set globally,
per server or per mount point.

DESCRIPTION

The
configuration file is made up of multiple section headers
followed by variable assignments associated with that
section. A section header is defined by a string enclosed by
[ and ] brackets. Variable assignments are
assignment statements that assign values to particular
variables using the = operator, as in
Proto=Tcp. The variables that can be assigned are the
set of NFS specific mount options listed in nfs(5)
together with the filesystem-independant mount options
listed in mount(8) and three additions:
Sloppy=True has the same effect as the -s
option to mount, and Foreground=True and
Background=True have the same effect as bg and
fg.

Options in the
config file may be given in upper, lower, or mixed case and
will be shifted to lower case before being passed to the
filesystem.

Boolean mount
options which do not need an equals sign must be given as
"option=True". Instead of preceeding such
an option with "no" its negation must be
given as "option=False".

Sections are
broken up into three basic categories: Global options,
Server options and Mount Point options.

[ NFSMount_Global_Options
] 

- This statically named section
defines all

of the global mount options
that can be applied to every NFS mount.

[ Server
"Server_Name" ]

- This section defines all the
mount options

that should be used on mounts
to a particular NFS server. The
"Server_Name" strings needs to be
surrounded by ’"’ and be an exact match
(ignoring case) of the server name used in the mount
command.

[ MountPoint
"Mount_Point" ]

- This section defines all the
mount 

options that should be used on
a particular mount point. The "Mount_Point"
string needs to be surrounded by ’"’ and be
an exact match of the mount point used in the mount
command. Though path names are usually case-sensitive, the
Mount_Point name is matched insensitive to case.

The sections
are processed in the reverse of the order listed above, and
any options already seen, either in a previous section or on
the command line, will be ignored when seen again.

EXAMPLES

These are some
example lines of how sections and variables are defined in
the configuration file.

[
NFSMount_Global_Options ] 
Proto=Tcp

The TCP/IPv4
protocol will be used on every NFS mount.

[ Server
"nfsserver.foo.com" ] 
rsize=32k 
wsize=32k 
proto=udp6

A 32k (32768
bytes) block size will be used as the read and write size on
all mounts to the ’nfsserver.foo.com’ server.
UDP/IPv6 is the protocol to be used.

[ MountPoint
"/export/home" ] 
Background=True

All mounts to
the ’/export/home’ export will be performed in
the background (i.e. done asynchronously).

FILES

/etc/nfsmount.conf

Default NFS mount configuration
file

/etc/nfsmount.conf.d

When this directory exists and
files ending with ".conf" exist, those files will
be used to set configuration variables. These files will
override variables set in /etc/nfsmount.conf
