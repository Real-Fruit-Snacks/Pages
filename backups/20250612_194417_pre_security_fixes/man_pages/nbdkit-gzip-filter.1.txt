NAME

nbdkit-gzip-filter
- decompress a .gz file

SYNOPSIS

nbdkit file
--filter=gzip FILENAME.gz

DESCRIPTION

"nbdkit-gzip-filter"
is a filter for nbdkit(1) which transparently
decompresses a gzip-compressed file. You can place this
filter on top of nbdkit-file-plugin(1) to decompress
a local .gz file, or on top of other plugins such as
nbdkit-curl-plugin(1):

nbdkit curl
--filter=gzip https://example.com/disk.gz

With
nbdkit-tar-filter(1) it can be used to extract files
from a compressed tar file:

nbdkit curl
--filter=tar --filter=gzip \ 
https://example.com/file.tar.gz tar-entry=disk.img

The filter only
allows read-only connections.

Note
that gzip files are not very good for random access in large
files because seeking to a position in the gzip file
involves decompressing all data before that point in the
file. A more practical method to compress large disk images
is to use the xz(1) format and
nbdkit-xz-filter(1).

To allow
seeking this filter has to keep the contents of the complete
uncompressed file, which it does in a hidden temporary file
under $TMPDIR.

PARAMETERS

There are no
parameters specific to this plugin.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

"TMPDIR"

Because the gzip format is not
seekable, this filter has to store the complete contents of
the compressed file in a temporary file located in
/var/tmp by default. You can override this location
by setting the "TMPDIR" environment variable
before starting nbdkit.

FILES

$filterdir/nbdkit-gzip-filter.so

The plugin.

Use
"nbdkit --dump-config" to find the location of
$filterdir.

"nbdkit-gzip-filter"
