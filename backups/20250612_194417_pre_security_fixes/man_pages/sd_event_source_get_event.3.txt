NAME

sd_event_source_get_event
- Retrieve the event loop of an event source

SYNOPSIS

#include

sd_event*
sd_event_source_get_event(sd_event_source *source); 

DESCRIPTION

sd_event_source_get_event()
may be used to retrieve the event loop object the event
source object specified as source is associated with.
The event loop object is specified when creating an event
source object with calls such as sd_event_add_io(3)
or sd_event_add_time(3).

RETURN VALUE

On success,
sd_event_source_get_event() returns the associated
event loop object. On failure, it returns NULL.

NOTES

Functions
described here are available as a shared library, which can
be compiled against and linked to with the
libsystemd pkg-config(1) file.

The code
described here uses getenv(3), which is declared to
be not multi-thread-safe. This means that the code calling
the functions described here must not call setenv(3)
from a parallel thread. It is recommended to only do calls
to setenv() from an early phase of the program when
no other threads have been started.

HISTORY

sd_event_source_get_event()
was added in version 229.
