Name

pcmdiff â€”
proof-of-concept raw PCM deltifier

Syntax

pcmdiff
file1 file2 >file3

Description

pcmdiff will
compute the arithmetic difference between the raw PCM files
file1 and file2 and write it to stdout. This
allows one to make the degradation that inherently comes
with lossy audio formats, audible.

Examples

oggenc -q0 -o test.ogg test.wav;

oggdec -o test2.wav test.ogg;

pcmdiff test.wav test2.wav >delta.wav;
