NAME
       Dpkg::Control::Types - export CTRL_* constants

DESCRIPTION
       You should not use this module directly. Instead you more likely want
       to use Dpkg::Control which also re-exports the same constants.

       This module has been introduced solely to avoid a dependency loop
       between Dpkg::Control and Dpkg::Control::Fields.

       Note: This is a private module, its API can change at any time.

CHANGES
