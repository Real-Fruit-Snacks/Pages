does. See that program’s manual for more information
about SRF and the relationship between the SRF and Netpbm
representation of the images.

netpbmfile
is the input stream, which defaults to Standard Input.
Output is always on Standard Output.

OPTIONS

In addition to
the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most
notably -quiet, see
 Common Options ),
srftopam recognizes the following command line
option: 
-verbose

Issue informational messages
about the input and the conversion process.
