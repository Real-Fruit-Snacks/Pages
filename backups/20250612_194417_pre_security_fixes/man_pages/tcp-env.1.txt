NAME

tcp-env - set
up TCP-related environment variables

SYNOPSIS

tcp-env
[ -rR ] [ -ttimeout ] program [
arg ... ]

DESCRIPTION

The input for
tcp-env must be a TCP connection. tcp-env
finds out information about that connection, puts the
information into several environment variables as described
in tcp-environ(5), and runs program with the
given arguments.

Usually
tcp-env is run from inetd. It might instead be
run from another server that already sets up the right
environment variables; if PROTO is set to TCP
when tcp-env is invoked, tcp-env assumes that
all the other variables are set up properly, and it does not
check whether the input is a TCP connection.

OPTIONS

-r

(Default.) Attempt to obtain
TCPREMOTEINFO from the remote host.

-R

Do not attempt to obtain TCPREMOTEINFO from the
remote host.

-ttimeout

Give up on the
TCPREMOTEINFO connection attempt after timeout
seconds. Default: 30.
