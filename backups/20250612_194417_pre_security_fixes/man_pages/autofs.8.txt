NAME

autofs -
Service control for the automounter

SYNOPSIS

If a SysV init
script system is being used: 
/etc/init.d/autofs
start|stop|restart|reload|status

or if the
systemd init system is being used: 
systemctl start|stop|restart|reload|status
autofs.service

DESCRIPTION

autofs
controls the operation of the automount(8) daemon(s)
running on the Linux system. Usually autofs is
invoked at system boot time with the start parameter
and at shutdown time with the stop parameter. Service
control actions can also be manually invoked by the system
administrator to shut down, restart, reload or obtain
service status.

OPERATION

autofs
will consult a configuration file /etc/auto.master
(see auto.master(5)) by default to find mount points
on the system. For each of those mount points
automount(8) will mount and start a thread, with the
appropriate parameters, to manage the mount point.

/etc/init.d/autofs
reload or systemctl autofs.service reload will
check the current auto.master map against the current
automount managed mounts. It will terminate those daemons or
threads (depending on autofs version) whose entries
have been removed, re-read the automount maps for entries
that have changed and start new daemons or threads for
entries that have been added.

If an indirect
map is modified then the change will become effective
immediately. If an indirect map uses the browse
option, the master map contains direct mount maps or the
auto.master map is modified then the autofs
service control reload action must be rerun to activate the
changes.

However, if a
map entry has offsets and is currently in use the offset
mounts cannot be updated due to potential mount
dependencies. In this case the map entry offsets will not be
updated until after the map entry has expired.

/etc/init.d/autofs
status or systemctl status autofs.service will
display the status of, automount(8), running or not.
When using the systemd init system the status output
includes somewhat more information related to the service
status.

systemctl(1)
has more functions than the actions mentioned here, see
systemctl(1) for more information.
