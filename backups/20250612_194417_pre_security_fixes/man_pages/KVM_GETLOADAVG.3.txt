SYNOPSIS

#include

#include 

int

kvm_getloadavg(kvm_t *kd,
double loadavg[], int nelem);

DESCRIPTION

The kvm_getloadavg()
function returns the number of processes in the system run
queue of the kernel indicated by kd, averaged over
various periods of time. Up to nelem samples are
retrieved and assigned to successive elements of
loadavg[]. The system imposes a maximum of 3 samples,
representing averages over the last 1, 5, and 15 minutes,
respectively.

DIAGNOSTICS

If the load average was
unobtainable, −1 is returned; otherwise, the number of
samples actually retrieved is returned.
