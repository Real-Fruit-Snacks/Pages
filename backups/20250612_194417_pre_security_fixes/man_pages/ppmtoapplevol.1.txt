NAME

ppmtoapplevol -
convert a PPM into an Apple volume label image

SYNOPSIS

ppmtoapplevol

[ppmfile]

DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

ppmtoapplevol
reads a PPM image as input and produces an Apple volume
label image as output.

EFI-based Apple
systems use a simple image format to provide textual labels
for devices. This program generates that format.

The input image
must be exactly 12 rows tall and up to 255 columns wide.

The program fails if it is not. Use pamfile to see
the dimensions of 
your image and pamscale or pamcut to make it
12 rows and less 
than 256 columns if it isn’t.

Netpbm does not
have a converter for the other direction.

ARGUMENTS

The optional
ppmfile argument is the name of the input file. 
The default is to read the input image from Standard
Input.

OPTIONS

There are no
command line options defined specifically for
ppmtoapplevol, but it recognizes the options common
to all programs based on libnetpbm (See
 Common Options
.)
