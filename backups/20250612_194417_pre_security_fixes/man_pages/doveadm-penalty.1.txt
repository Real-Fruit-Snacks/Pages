penalties. (Extend me!/explain it)

OPTIONS

Global
doveadm(1) options:

-D

Enables verbosity and debug messages.

-o setting=value

Overrides the configuration
setting from /etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf and
from the userdb with the given value. In order to
override multiple settings, the -o option may be
specified multiple times.

-v

Enables verbosity, including progress counter.

Command
specific options: 
-a anvil_socket_path

This option is used to specify
an alternative socket. The option's argument is either an
absolute path to a local UNIX domain socket, or a hostname
and port (hostname:port), in order to connect
a remote host via a TCP socket.

By default
doveadm(1) will use the socket
/run/dovecot/anvil. The socket may be located in
another directory, when the default base_dir setting
was overridden in /etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf.

(ip/mask).
