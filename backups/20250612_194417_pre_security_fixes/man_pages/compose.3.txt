NAME

compose - n-ary
function application in expressions (rheolef-7.2)

SYNOPSIS

template

Expression compose (const Function& f, const
Expressions&... exprs);

DESCRIPTION

Compose a n-ary
function f with n fields in interpolate(3) and
integrate(3) nonlinear expressions.

EXAMPLE

The
compose operator is used for applying a
user-provided function to a field:

Float f (Float
u) { return 1/u + sqrt(u); } 
... 
field vh = interpolate (Xh, compose(f, uh));

When two
arguments are involved:

Float g (Float
u, Float v) { return v/u + sqrt(u*v); } 
... 
field wh = interpolate (Xh, compose(g, uh, vh));

The
compose operator supports general n-ary functions
and class-functions.

CHARACTERISTIC

The
compose function supports also the method of
characteristic(2) used e.g. for convection-diffusion
problems:

characteristic
X (-delta_t*uh); 
test v (Xh); 
field lh = integrate (compose(uh,X)*v);
