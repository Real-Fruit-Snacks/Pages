NAME
       Font::TTF::Maxp - Maximum Profile table in a font

DESCRIPTION
       A collection of useful instance variables following the TTF standard.
       Probably the most used being "numGlyphs". Note that this particular
       value is foundational and should be kept up to date by the application,
       it is not updated by "update".

       Handles table versions 0.5, 1.0

INSTANCE VARIABLES
       No others beyond those specified in the standard:

           numGlyphs
           maxPoints
           maxContours
           maxCompositePoints
           maxCompositeContours
           maxZones
           maxTwilightPoints
           maxStorage
           maxFunctionDefs
           maxInstructionDefs
           maxStackElements
           maxSizeOfInstructions
           maxComponentElements
           maxComponentDepth

METHODS
   $t->read
       Reads the table into memory

   $t->out($fh)
       Writes the table to a file either from memory or by copying.

   $t->minsize()
       Returns the minimum size this table can be. If it is smaller than this,
       then the table must be bad and should be deleted or whatever.

   $t->update
       Calculates all the maximum values for a font based on the glyphs in the
       font.  Only those fields which require hinting code interpretation are
       ignored and left as they were read.

BUGS
       None known
