NAME

qmail-control -
qmail configuration files

INTRODUCTION

You can change
the behavior of the qmail system by modifying
qmailâ€™s control files in
/var/lib/qmail/control.

qmail
can survive with just one control file, me,
containing the fully-qualified name of the current host.
This file is used as the default for other hostname-related
control files.

Comments are
allowed in badmailfrom, locals,
percenthack, qmqpservers, rcpthosts,
smtproutes, and virtualdomains. Trailing
spaces and tabs are allowed in any control file.

The following
table lists all control files other than me. See the
corresponding man pages for further details.
