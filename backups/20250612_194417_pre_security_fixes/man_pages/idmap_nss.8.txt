NAME

idmap_nss -
Samba's idmap_nss Backend for Winbind

DESCRIPTION

The idmap_nss
plugin provides a means to map Unix users and groups to
Windows accounts. This provides a simple means of ensuring
that the SID for a Unix user named jsmith is reported as the
one assigned to DOMAIN\jsmith which is necessary for
reporting ACLs on files and printers stored on a Samba
member server.

IDMAP OPTIONS

range = low -
high

Defines the available matching
UID and GID range for which the backend is authoritative.
Note that the range acts as a filter. Returned UIDs or GIDs
by NSS modules that fall outside the range are ignored and
the corresponding maps discarded. It is intended as a way to
avoid accidental UID/GID overlaps between local and remotely
defined IDs.

use_upn =

Some NSS modules can return and
handle UPNs and/or down-level logon names (e.g., DOMAIN\user
or user@REALM).

If this
parameter is enabled the returned names from NSS will be
parsed and the resulting namespace will be used as the
authoritative namespace instead of the IDMAP domain name.
Also, down-level logon names will be sent to NSS instead of
the plain username to give NSS modules a hint about the
user's correct domain.

Default: no

EXAMPLES

This example
shows how to use idmap_nss to obtain the local account ID's
for its own domain (SAMBA) from NSS, whilst allocating new
mappings for the default domain (*) and any trusted
domains.

[global]

idmap config * : backend = tdb

idmap config * : range = 1000000-1999999

idmap config SAMBA : backend = nss

idmap config SAMBA : range = 1000-999999
