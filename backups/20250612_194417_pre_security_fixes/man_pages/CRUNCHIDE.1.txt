CRUNCHIDE(1) BSD General Commands Manual
CRUNCHIDE(1)

NAME

crunchide — hides
symbol names from ld, for crunching programs together

SYNOPSIS

crunchide
[−f keep-list-file]
[−k keep-symbol]
[object-file ...]

DESCRIPTION

The crunchide utility
hides the global symbols of object-file such that
they are ignored by subsequent runs of the linker, ld(1).
Some symbols may be left visible via the −k
keep-symbol and −f keep-list-file
options. The keep-list-file must contain a list of
symbols to keep visible, one symbol per line. The names
given by keep-symbol or in keep-list-file
should be C names. For example, to keep the C function
’’foo’’ visible, the option
’’-k foo’’ should be used.

The
crunchide utility is designed as a companion program
for crunchgen(1), which automates the process of creating
crunched binaries from multiple component programs.
