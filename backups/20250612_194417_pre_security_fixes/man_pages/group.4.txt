group file

DESCRIPTION

The
group file is a local source of group information.
The group file can be used in conjunction with other
group sources, including the NIS maps
group.byname and group.bygid and the
NIS+ table group. Programs use the
getgrnam(3C) routines to access this information.

The
group file contains a one-line entry for each group
recognized by the system, of the form:

groupname:password:
gid:user-list

where 
groupname

The name of the group.

gid

The group’s unique numerical ID (GID) within the
system. 

user-list

A comma-separated list of users
allowed in the group.

The maximum
value of the gid field is 2147483647. To maximize
interoperability and compatibility, administrators are
recommended to assign groups using the range of GIDs below
60000 where possible.

If the password
field is empty, no password is demanded. During user
identification and authentication, the supplementary group
access list is initialized sequentially from information in
this file. If a user is in more groups than the system is
configured for, {NGROUPS_MAX}, a warning will be given and
subsequent group specifications will be ignored.

Malformed
entries cause routines that read this file to halt, in which
case group assignments specified further along are never
made. To prevent this from happening, use grpck(1B)
to check the /etc/group database from time to
time.

Previous
releases used a group entry beginning with a
’+’ (plus sign) or
’−’ (minus sign) to selectively
incorporate entries from NIS maps for group. If still
required, this is supported by specifying
group:compat in nsswitch.conf(4). The
’’compat’’ source may not be
supported in future releases. The preferred sources are,
’’files’’ followed by
’’nisplus’’. This has the effect of
incorporating the entire contents of the NIS+ group
table after the group file.

EXAMPLES

Example 1:
Sample of a group file.

Here is a
sample group file:

root::0:root

stooges:q.mJzTnu8icF.:10:larry,moe,curly

and the sample
group entry from nsswitch.conf:

group: files
nisplus

With these
entries, the group stooges will have members
larry, moe, and curly, and all groups
listed in the NIS+ group table are effectively
incorporated after the entry for stooges.

If the
group file was:

root::0:root

stooges:q.mJzTnu8icF.:10:larry,moe,curly 
+:

and the group
entry from nsswitch.conf:

group:
compat

all the groups
listed in the NIS group.bygid and group.byname
maps would be effectively incorporated after the entry for
stooges.
