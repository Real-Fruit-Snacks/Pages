DESCRIPTION

doveadm
move can be used for moving mails between mailboxes
for one or more users. The search_query is used to
restrict which messages are moved into the
destination mailbox. 
doveadm copy behaves the same as doveadm move,
except that copied messages will not be expunged after
copying.

In the first
form, doveadm(1) will execute the
move/copy action with the environment of the
logged in system user.

In the second
form, doveadm(1) will iterate over all users, found
in the configured user_db(s), and move or copy each
user's messages, matching the given search_query,
into the user's destination mailbox.

In the third
form, doveadm(1) will iterate over all users, found
in the given file, and move or copy each user's
messages, matching the given search_query, into the
user's destination mailbox.

In the fourth
form, matching mails will be moved or copied only for given
user(s).

OPTIONS

Global
doveadm(1) options:

-D

Enables verbosity and debug messages.

-o setting=value

Overrides the configuration
setting from /etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf and
from the userdb with the given value. In order to
override multiple settings, the -o option may be
specified multiple times.

-v

Enables verbosity, including progress counter.

Command
specific options:

-A

If the -A option is
present, the command will be performed for all users.
Using this option in combination with system users from
userdb { driver = passwd } is not recommended,
because it contains also users with a lower UID than the one
configured with the first_valid_uid setting.

When the SQL
userdb module is used make sure that the
iterate_query setting in
/etc/dovecot/dovecot-sql.conf.ext matches your
database layout. When using the LDAP userdb module, make
sure that the iterate_attrs and iterate_filter
settings in /etc/dovecot/dovecot-ldap.conf.ext match
your LDAP schema. Otherwise doveadm(1) will be unable
to iterate over all users.

-F file

Execute the command for
all the users in the file. This is similar to the
-A option, but instead of getting the list of users
from the userdb, they are read from the given file.
The file contains one username per line.

-S socket_path

The option's argument is either
an absolute path to a local UNIX domain socket, or a
hostname and port (hostname:port), in order to
connect a remote host via a TCP socket.

This allows an
administrator to execute doveadm(1) mail commands
through the given socket.

-u user/mask

Run the command only for
the given user. It's also possible to use '*'
and '?' wildcards (e.g. -u *@example.org). 
When neither the -A option, nor the
-F file option, nor the
-u user was specified, the command
will be executed with the environment of the currently
logged in user.

ARGUMENTS

destination

The name of the destination
mailbox, into which the mails should be moved or copied. The
destination mailbox must exist, otherwise this
command will fail.

search_query

Move/copy messages matching the
given search query. See doveadm-search-query(7) for
details.

user source_user

The keyword user
followed by a valid user name. When this argument is
present, doveadm(1) will apply the
search_query to the source_user's
mail_location. 
Limitation: Currently the users, specified by -u
user and user source_user, must share
the same UID and GID.

EXAMPLE

Move jane's
messages - received in September 2011 - from her INBOX into
her archive.

doveadm move
-u jane Archive/2011/09 mailbox INBOX BEFORE \ 
2011-10-01 SINCE 01-Sep-2011
