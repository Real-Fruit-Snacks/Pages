NAME
       Dpkg::Changelog::Entry - represents a changelog entry

DESCRIPTION
       This class represents a changelog entry. It is composed of a set of
       lines with specific purpose: a header line, changes lines, a trailer
       line. Blank lines can be between those kind of lines.

METHODS
       $entry = Dpkg::Changelog::Entry->new()
           Creates a new object. It doesn't represent a real changelog entry
           until one has been successfully parsed or built from scratch.

       $str = $entry->output()
       "$entry"
           Get a string representation of the changelog entry.

       $entry->output($fh)
           Print the string representation of the changelog entry to a
           filehandle.

       $entry->get_part($part)
           Return either a string (for a single line) or an array ref (for
           multiple lines) corresponding to the requested part. $part can be
           "header, "changes", "trailer", "blank_after_header",
           "blank_after_changes", "blank_after_trailer".

       $entry->set_part($part, $value)
           Set the value of the corresponding part. $value can be a string or
           an array ref.

       $entry->extend_part($part, $value)
           Concatenate $value at the end of the part. If the part is already a
           multi-line value, $value is added as a new line otherwise it's
           concatenated at the end of the current line.

       $is_empty = $entry->is_empty()
           Returns 1 if the changelog entry doesn't contain anything at all.
           Returns 0 as soon as it contains something in any of its non-blank
           parts.

       $entry->normalize()
           Normalize the content. Strip whitespaces at end of lines, use a
           single empty line to separate each part.

       $src = $entry->get_source()
           Return the name of the source package associated to the changelog
           entry.

       $ver = $entry->get_version()
           Return the version associated to the changelog entry.

       @dists = $entry->get_distributions()
           Return a list of target distributions for this version.

       $ctrl = $entry->get_optional_fields()
           Return a set of optional fields exposed by the changelog entry.  It
           always returns a Dpkg::Control object (possibly empty though).

       $urgency = $entry->get_urgency()
           Return the urgency of the associated upload.

       $maint = $entry->get_maintainer()
           Return the string identifying the person who signed this changelog
           entry.

       $time = $entry->get_timestamp()
           Return the timestamp of the changelog entry.

       $time = $entry->get_timepiece()
           Return the timestamp of the changelog entry as a Time::Piece
           object.

           This function might return undef if there was no timestamp.

       $str = $entry->get_dpkg_changes()
           Returns a string that is suitable for usage in a "Changes" field in
           the output format of "dpkg-parsechangelog".
