DESCRIPTION

gbp push
pushes your local changes to a remote repository. It is best
run after uploading a Debian package to the archive to
update you debian-branch, upstream-branch,
pristine-tar branch and corresponding tags. It will in
order

•

Verify that it is being executed from the
debian-branch. 

•

Determine the debian tag from debian/changelog
and add it the list of things to push if the changelog does
not indicate an unreleased package.

•

Determine the upstream tag from debian/changelog
and add it to the list of things to push if it’s not a
native package.

•

Determine if the tags correspond to the branch tips of
the corresponding upstream and debian branches. If so, these
branches will be added to the list of things to push. If not
the changes will only be pushed up to the commit that is
referenced by the corresponding tag.

•

Determine if the pristine-tar branch needs to be pushed
and if so adds it to the list of things to push.

•

Finally, if not in dry-run mode, pushes the above
changes to the remote side.

If a
remote is given on the command line the changes are
pushed to the given remote repository. By default it will
push to the current branchs remote and fall back to
origin.

OPTIONS

--version

Print version of the program,
i.e. version of the git-buildpackage suite

-v, --verbose

Verbose execution

-h, --help

Print help and exit

--color=[auto|on|off]

Whether to use colored
output.

--color-scheme=COLOR_SCHEME

Colors to use in output (when
color is enabled). The format for COLOR_SCHEME is
’:::’.
Numerical values and color names are accepted, empty fields
imply the default color. For example,
--git-color-scheme=’cyan:34::’ would show
debug messages in cyan, info messages in blue and other
messages in default (i.e. warning and error messages in
red).

--ignore-branch

Don’t fail if the
debian-branch does not match the currently checked
out branach and push the current branch instead.

--debian-branch=branch_name

The branch in the Git
repository the Debian package is being developed on. If set
to the empty value the branch will not be pushed.

--debian-tag=TAG-FORMAT

Use this tag format when
looking for tags corresponding to a Debian version. Default
is debian/%(version)s. If set to the empty value the
tag will not be pushed.

--upstream-branch=branch_name

The branch in the Git
repository the upstream sources are put onto. If set to the
empty value the branch will not be pushed.

--upstream-tag=TAG-FORMAT

Use this tag format when
looking for tags of upstream versions. Default is
upstream/%(version)s. If set to the empty value the
tag will not be pushed.

--pristine-tar

Whether to update the
pristine-tar branch too.

--dry-run

Pass the --dry-run to
git push. So don’t push anything, only check if
things are pushable.

CONFIGURATION FILES

Several
gbp.conf files are parsed to set defaults for the
above command-line arguments. See the gbp.conf(5)
manpage for details.
