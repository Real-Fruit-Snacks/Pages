NAME

sd_bus_message_rewind
- Return to beginning of message or current container

SYNOPSIS

#include

int
sd_bus_message_rewind(sd_bus_message *m,
int complete); 

DESCRIPTION

sd_bus_message_rewind()
moves the "read pointer" in the message m
to either the beginning of the message (if complete
is true) or to the beginning of the currently open
container. If no container is open, complete has no
effect.

RETURN VALUE

On success,
this function returns 0 or a positive integer. The value is
zero if the current container or whole message in case no
container is open is empty, and positive otherwise. On
failure, it returns a negative errno-style error code.

Errors

Returned errors may indicate the following problems:

-EINVAL

The m parameter is
NULL.

-EPERM

The message m has not
been sealed.

NOTES

Functions
described here are available as a shared library, which can
be compiled against and linked to with the
libsystemd pkg-config(1) file.

The code
described here uses getenv(3), which is declared to
be not multi-thread-safe. This means that the code calling
the functions described here must not call setenv(3)
from a parallel thread. It is recommended to only do calls
to setenv() from an early phase of the program when
no other threads have been started.

HISTORY

sd_bus_message_rewind()
was added in version 240.
