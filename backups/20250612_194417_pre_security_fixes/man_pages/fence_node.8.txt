NAME

fence_node
− a utility to run fence agents

SYNOPSIS

fence_node
[OPTIONS] nodename

DESCRIPTION

This utility
runs a fence agent against nodename. The agent and
args are taken from the running cluster configuration based
on cluster.conf(5).

fence_node
is a wrapper around the libfence functions: fence_node() and
unfence_node(). These libfence functions use libccs to read
the node fencing configuration, which means that corosync
(with cman and ccs) must be running to use
fence_node(8).

The
fenced(8) daemon is the main user of
libfence:fence_node(), and the configuration details for
that function are given in the fenced(8) man
page.

Fencing vs.
Unfencing 
The main use for unfencing is with storage/SAN (non-power)
agents.

When using
power-based fencing agents, the fencing action itself is
supposed to turn a node back on after first turning the
power off (this happens automatically with a
"reboot" action, and needs to be configured
explicitly as "off" + "on"
otherwise.)

When using
storage-based fencing agents, the fencing action is not
allowed to re-enable a node after disabling it. Re-enabling
a fenced node is only safe once the node has been rebooted.
A natural way to re-enable a fenced node’s access to
storage, is for that node to re-enable the access itself
during its startup process. The cman init script calls
fence_node -U (nodename defaults to local nodename when
unfencing). Unfencing a node without an 
configuration (see below) is a no-op.

The basic
differences between fencing and unfencing:

Fencing

1.

libfence: fence_node(), command line: fence_node
nodename 

2.

Turns off or disables a node.

3.

Agents run with the default action of "off",
"disable" or "reboot".

4.

Performed by a cluster node against another node that
fails (by the fenced daemon).

Unfencing

1.

libfence: unfence_node(),
command line: fence_node -U nodename

2.

Turns on or enables a node.

3.

Agents run with the explicit action of "on" or
"enable". 

4.

Performed by a cluster node "against" itself
during startup (by the cman init script).

OPTIONS

−U

Unfence the node, default local
node name.

−v

Show fence agent results, −vv to also show agent
args. 

−h

Print a help message describing available options, then
exit. 

−V

Print program version information, then exit.

FILES

The
Unfencing/unfence_node() configuration is very similar to
the Fencing/fence_node() configuration shown in
fenced(8). Unfencing is only performed for a node
with an  section:

The
 section does not contain 
sections like the  section does. It contains
 references directly, which mirror the
corresponding device sections for , with the
notable addition of the explicit action of "on" or
"enable". The same  is
referenced by both fence and unfence  lines,
and the same per-node args should be repeated.
