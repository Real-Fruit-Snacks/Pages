DESCRIPTION

chips is
an Xorg driver for Chips and Technologies video processors.
The majority of the Chips and Technologies chipsets are
supported by this driver. In general the limitation on the
capabilities of this driver are determined by the chipset on
which it is run. Where possible, this driver provides full
acceleration and supports the following depths: 1, 4, 8, 15,
16, 24 and on the latest chipsets an 8+16 overlay mode. All
visual types are supported for depth 1, 4 and 8 and both
TrueColor and DirectColor visuals are supported where
possible. Multi-head configurations are supported on PCI or
AGP buses.

SUPPORTED HARDWARE

The
chips driver supports video processors on most of the
bus types currently available. The chipsets supported fall
into one of three architectural classes. A basic
architecture, the WinGine architecture and the newer
HiQV architecture.

Basic
Architecture

The supported
chipsets are ct65520, ct65525, ct65530, ct65535, ct65540,
ct65545, ct65546 and ct65548

Color depths 1,
4 and 8 are supported on all chipsets, while depths 15, 16
and 24 are supported only on the 65540, 65545, 65546
and 65548 chipsets. The driver is accelerated when
used with the 65545, 65546 or 65548 chipsets,
however the DirectColor visual is not available.

Wingine
Architecture

The supported
chipsets are ct64200 and ct64300

Color depths 1,
4 and 8 are supported on both chipsets, while depths 15, 16
and 24 are supported only on the 64300 chipsets. The
driver is accelerated when used with the 64300
chipsets, however the DirectColor visual is not
available.

HiQV
Architecture

The supported
chipsets are ct65550, ct65554, ct65555, ct68554,
ct69000 and ct69030

Color depths 1,
4, 8, 15, 16, 24 and 8+16 are supported on all chipsets. The
DirectColor visual is supported on all color depths except
the 8+16 overlay mode. Full acceleration is supplied for all
chipsets.

CONFIGURATION DETAILS

Please refer to
xorg.conf(5x) for general configuration details. This
section only covers configuration details specific to this
driver.

The driver
auto-detects the chipset type, but the following
ChipSet names may optionally be specified in the
config file "Device" section, and will
override the auto-detection:

"ct65520",
"ct65525", "ct65530",
"ct65535", "ct65540",
"ct65545", "ct65546",
"ct65548", "ct65550",
"ct65554", "ct65555",
"ct68554", "ct69000",
"ct69030", "ct64200",
"ct64300".

The driver will
auto-detect the amount of video memory present for all
chipsets. But maybe overridden with the VideoRam
entry in the config file "Device"
section.

The following
driver Options are supported, on one or more of the
supported chipsets: 
Option "NoAccel"
"boolean"

Disable or enable acceleration.
Default: acceleration is enabled.

Option "NoLinear"
"boolean"

Disables linear addressing in
cases where it is enabled by default. Default: off

Option "Linear"
"boolean"

Enables linear addressing in
cases where it is disabled by default. Default: off

Option "HWCursor"
"boolean"

Enable or disable the HW
cursor. Default: on.

Option "SWCursor"
"boolean"

Enable or disable the SW
cursor. Default: off.

Option "STN"
"boolean"

Force detection of STN screen
type. Default: off.

Option
"UseModeline"
"boolean"

Reprogram flat panel timings
with values from the modeline. Default: off

Option
"FixPanelSize"
"boolean"

Reprogram flat panel size with
values from the modeline. Default: off

Option "NoStretch"
"boolean"

This option disables the
stretching on a mode on a flat panel to fill the screen.
Default: off

Option "LcdCenter"
"boolean"

Center the mode displayed on
the flat panel on the screen. Default: off

Option "HWclocks"
"boolean"

Force the use of fixed hardware
clocks on chips that support both fixed and programmable
clocks. Default: off

Option "UseVclk1"
"boolean"

Use the Vclk1 programmable
clock on HiQV chipsets instead of Vclk2. Default:
off

Option "FPClock8"
"float" 
Option "FPClock16" "float"

Option "FPClock24" "float"

Option "FPClock32"
"float"

Force the use of a particular
video clock speed for use with the flat panel at a specified
depth

Option "MMIO"
"boolean"

Force the use of memory mapped
IO for acceleration registers. Default: off

Option "FullMMIO"
"boolean"

Force the use of memory mapped
IO where it can be used. Default: off

Option
"SuspendHack"
"boolean"

Force driver to leave centering
and stretching registers alone. This can fix some laptop
suspend/resume problems. Default: off

Option
"Overlay"

Enable 8+24 overlay mode. Only
appropriate for depth 24. Default: off.

Option "ColorKey"
"integer"

Set the colormap index used for
the transparency key for the depth 8 plane when operating in
8+16 overlay mode. The value must be in the range
2−255. Default: 255.

Option "VideoKey"
"integer"

This sets the default pixel
value for the YUV video overlay key. Default: undefined.

Option "ShadowFB"
"boolean"

Enable or disable use of the
shadow framebuffer layer. Default: off.

Option
"SyncOnGreen"
"boolean"

Enable or disable combining the
sync signals with the green signal. Default: off.

Option "ShowCache"
"boolean"

Enable or disable viewing
offscreen memory. Used for debugging only Default: off.

Option "18bitBus"
"boolean"

Force the driver to assume that
the flat panel has an 18bit data bus. Default: off.

Option
"Crt2Memory"
"integer"

In a dual-head mode (69030
only) this option selects the amount of memory to set aside
for the second head. If not specified, half the memory is
used. Default: off.

Option
"DualRefresh"
"integer"

The 69030 supports independent
refresh rates on its two display channels. This mode of
operations uses additional memory bandwidth and thus limits
the maximum colour depth and refresh rate that can be
achieved, and so is off by default. Using this option forces
the use of an independent refresh rate on the two screens.
Default: off.

Option "FpMode"
"boolean"

The driver probes the chip to
find out if a flat panel (LCD) is connected and active. If
this is true it limits the possible screen size to the
maximum resolution of the panel. The chips is initialized by
the BIOS which may set the chip to ’dual’ mode
even if no panel is connected. In this case the available
resolution on the CRT is limited to the panel size the BIOS
has set. To tell the driver that no panel is connected
despite of what the BIOS is saying set this option to off.
Don’t set it to off if a panel is connected. Default:
value probed by BIOS.
