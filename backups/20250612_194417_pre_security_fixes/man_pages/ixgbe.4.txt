IXGBE(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual IXGBE(4)

NAME

ixgbe — Intel(R)
10Gb Ethernet driver for the FreeBSD operating system

SYNOPSIS

To compile this driver into the
kernel, place the following line in your kernel
configuration file:

device
ixgbe

Alternatively,
to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following line in loader.conf(5):

if_ixgbe_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION

The ixgbe driver provides
support for PCI 10Gb Ethernet adapters based on the Intel
82598EB Intel(R) Network Connections. The driver supports
Jumbo Frames, MSIX, TSO, and RSS.

For questions
related to hardware requirements, refer to the documentation
supplied with your Intel 10GbE adapter. All hardware
requirements listed apply to use with FreeBSD.

Support for
Jumbo Frames is provided via the interface MTU setting.
Selecting an MTU larger than 1500 bytes with the ifconfig(8)
utility configures the adapter to receive and transmit Jumbo
Frames. The maximum MTU size for Jumbo Frames is 16114.

This driver
version supports VLANs. For information on enabling VLANs,
see ifconfig(8).
