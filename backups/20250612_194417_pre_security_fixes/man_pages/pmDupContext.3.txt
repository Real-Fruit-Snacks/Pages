pmDupContext
- duplicate a PMAPI context

C SYNOPSIS

#include

int
pmDupContext(void);

cc ...

DESCRIPTION

An application
using the Performance Metrics Application Programming
Interface (PMAPI) may manipulate several concurrent
contexts, each associated with a source of performance
metrics, e.g. pmcd(1) on some host, or a set of
archives of performance metrics as created by
pmlogger(1).

Calling
pmDupContext will replicate the current PMAPI
context, returning a handle for the new context that may be
used with subsequent calls to pmUseContext(3).

Once created,
the duplicated context and the original context have
independent existence, and so their instance profiles and
collection time (relevant only for archive contexts) may be
independently varied.

The newly
replicated context becomes the current context.
