BOOTPARAMD(8) BSD System Manager’s Manual
BOOTPARAMD(8)

NAME

bootparamd — boot
parameter server

SYNOPSIS

rpc.bootparamd
[-d] [-s] [-r router]
[-f file]

DESCRIPTION

bootparamd is a server
process that provides information to diskless clients
necessary for booting. It consults the
/etc/bootparams file to find the information it
needs.

This version
will allow the use of aliases on the hostname in the
/etc/bootparams file. The returned hostname to the
whoami request done by the booting client will be the name
that appears in /etc/bootparams and not the canonical
name. In this way you can keep the answer short enough so
that machines that cannot handle long hostnames won’t
fail during boot.

OPTIONS 
-d

Display
debugging information.

-s

Log the
debugging information to syslog.

-r router

The default router (a machine
or an IP-address). This defaults to the machine running the
server.

-f file

The file to use as boot
parameter file instead of /etc/bootparams.

FILES

/etc/bootparams

BUGS

You may find the syslog loggings
too verbose.
