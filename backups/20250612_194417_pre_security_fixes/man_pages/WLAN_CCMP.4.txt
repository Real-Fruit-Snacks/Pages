WLAN_CCMP(4)

NAME

wlan_ccmp â€”
AES-CCMP crypto support for 802.11 devices

SYNOPSIS

device wlan_ccmp

DESCRIPTION

The wlan_ccmp module
handles the AES-CCMP cryptographic requirements of the WPA
and 802.11i protocols. It does encapsulation and
decapsulation of CCMP-encoded 802.11 frames and optionally
calculates the AES-CCMP cipher. The wlan_ccmp module
is an 802.11 cryptographic plugin module for use by the
wlan(4) module. This module is automatically loaded if an
AES-CCMP key is configured; typically by a WPA supplicant
program such as wpa_supplicant, or a WPA authenticator
program such as hostapd. Should the underlying
network device not be capable of doing the AES-CCMP
calculations in hardware, the wlan_ccmp module will
do the work.
