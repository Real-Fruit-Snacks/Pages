SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION

aatv is
a small program which allows you to watch TV in a text-based
console, i.e. in a virtual console or in an xterm.

If you just
want to see what it does, and don’t want to mess with
frequencies just tune your TV card, with xawtv(1) for
example, and then launch aatv. When aatv starts, it keeps
the frequency the card is tuned on. You might have to change
the video mode (to PAL, NTSC or SECAM) in the config
file.
