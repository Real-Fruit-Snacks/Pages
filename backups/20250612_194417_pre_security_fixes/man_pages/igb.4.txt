IGB(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual IGB(4)

NAME

igb — Intel(R)
PRO/1000 PCI Express Gigabit Ethernet adapter driver

SYNOPSIS

To compile this driver into the
kernel, place the following line in your kernel
configuration file:

device
igb

Alternatively,
to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following line in loader.conf(5):

if_igb_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION

The igb driver provides
support for PCI Express Gigabit Ethernet adapters based on
the Intel 82575, 82576, 82580, i21x and i35x Ethernet
controller chips. The driver supports Transmit/Receive
checksum offload and Jumbo Frames. Furthermore it supports
TCP segmentation offload (TSO) on all adapters. The
identification LEDs of the adapters supported by the
igb driver can be controlled via the led(4) API for
localization purposes.

For questions
related to hardware requirements, refer to the documentation
supplied with your Intel PRO/1000 adapter. All hardware
requirements listed apply to use with FreeBSD.

Support for
Jumbo Frames is provided via the interface MTU setting.
Selecting an MTU larger than 1500 bytes with the ifconfig(8)
utility configures the adapter to receive and transmit Jumbo
Frames. The maximum MTU size for Jumbo Frames is 9216.

This driver
supports hardware assisted VLANs. The igb driver
supports the following media types:

autoselect

Enables
auto-negotiation for speed and duplex.

10baseT/UTP

Sets 10Mbps
operation. Use the mediaopt option to select
full-duplex mode.

100baseTX

Sets 100Mbps
operation. Use the mediaopt option to select
full-duplex mode.

1000baseSX

Sets 1000Mbps
operation. Only full-duplex mode is supported at this
speed.

1000baseTX

Sets 1000Mbps
operation. Only full-duplex mode is supported at this
speed.

The igb
driver supports the following media options:

full-duplex

Forces
full-duplex operation

half-duplex

Forces
half-duplex operation.

Only use
mediaopt to set the driver to full-duplex. If
mediaopt is not specified, the driver defaults to
half-duplex.

For more
information on configuring this device, see ifconfig(8).

HARDWARE

The igb driver supports
Gigabit Ethernet adapters based on the Intel 82575 and 82576
controller chips:

•

Intel Gigabit ET Dual Port
Server Adapter (82576)

•

Intel Gigabit VT Quad Port
Server Adapter (82575)

•

Intel Single, Dual and Quad
Gigabit Ethernet Controller (82580)

•

Intel i210 and i211 Gigabit
Ethernet Controller

•

Intel i350 and i354 Gigabit
Ethernet Controller

LOADER TUNABLES

Tunables can be set at the
loader(8) prompt before booting the kernel or stored in
loader.conf(5).

hw.igb.rxd

Number of receive descriptors
allocated by the driver. The default value is 1024. The
minimum is 80, and the maximum is 4096.

hw.igb.txd

Number of transmit descriptors
allocated by the driver. The default value is 1024. The
minimum is 80, and the maximum is 4096.

hw.igb.enable_aim

If set to 1, enable Adaptive
Interrupt Moderation. The default is to enable Adaptive
Interrupt Moderation.

hw.igb.num_queues

Number of queues used for data
transfer. If set to 0, number of queues will be configured
automatically based on number of CPUs and max supported
MSI-X messages on the device.

kern.ipc.nmbclusters

The maximum number of mbuf
clusters allowed. If the system has more than one igb card
or jumbo frames are enabled, this value will need to be
increased.

kern.ipc.nmbjumbo9k

The maximum number of mbuf 9k
jumbo clusters allowed. Increasing this to allow for at
least 8192 extra clusters per interface can allow for an mtu
of 8192.

EXAMPLES

Make the identification LED of
igb0 blink:

echo f2 >
/dev/led/igb0

Turn the
identification LED of igb0 off again:

echo 0 >
/dev/led/igb0

DIAGNOSTICS

igb%d: Unable to allocate bus
resource: memory  A fatal initialization error has
occurred.

igb%d: Unable
to allocate bus resource: interrupt  A fatal
initialization error has occurred.

igb%d:
watchdog timeout -- resetting  The device has
stopped responding to the network, or there is a problem
with the network connection (cable).
