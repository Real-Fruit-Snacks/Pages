NAME

madison-lite —
display versions of Debian packages in an archive

SYNOPSIS

madison-lite
[--config-file file]
[--mirror directory] [--nocache]
[--update] [-S] [-r]
[-a architecture[,...]]
[-c component[,...]]
[-s suite[,...]] package
[...]

DESCRIPTION

madison-lite inspects a
local Debian package archive and displays the versions of
the given packages found in each suite (for example,
stable, testing, or unstable) in a brief but easily
human-readable form. It aims to be a drop-in replacement for
the madison utility (since renamed to dak ls),
from the dak archive management suite that runs on
the central Debian archive systems, but one which can run
without access to the archive’s SQL database.

The following
options are available:

--config-file
file

Read configuration from
file, and ignore the system configuration file (see
CONFIGURATION below).

--mirror
directory

Quick configuration: use
directory as the top level of the Debian mirror.

--nocache

Normally, parts of the
Packages and Sources files in the archive are
cached in ~/.madison-lite/cache for speed. This
option disables that behaviour.

--update

Force caches of Packages
and Sources files to be updated.

-S,
--source-and-binary

Interpret package as a
source package name, and display versions of any associated
binary packages as well as of the source package.

-r, --regex

Interpret package as a
Perl regular expression anchored at the start of the package
name rather than as an exact name. Make sure to quote any
shell metacharacters such as ’*’ or
’?’ if necessary.

-a, --architecture
architecture[,...]

Display only entries for
packages built for these architectures. Separate multiple
architectures with commas or spaces.

-c, --component
component[,...]

Display only entries in the
given components. Separate multiple components with commas
or spaces.

-s, --suite
suite[,...]

Display only entries in the
given suites. Separate multiple suites with commas or
spaces.

CONFIGURATION

madison-lite reads
configuration information from the file named by
--config-file, or, if that is not supplied, from the
first of ~/.madison-lite/config and
/etc/madison-lite/config that exists.

The following
configuration directives are recognized:

mirror directory

Set the top-level directory of
the local Debian mirror. Relative directories in the suite
directive are interpreted relative to this directory.
Defaults to the current directory.

suite name directory
[component [...]]

Defines the suite name
based at directory, containing the specified
components (defaulting to all subdirectories of
directory). Output is displayed following the order
of suite directives in the configuration file. If no suite
directives are present, then every subdirectory of the
dists directory under mirror is treated as a
suite, with all of their subdirectories as components.

The Debian
archive is structured such that the subdirectories of each
suite directory identify components (such as main).
Each of those in turn has subdirectories for each
architecture (binary-i386, and so on), each of which
contains any or all of Packages, Packages.gz,
Packages.bz2, and Packages.xz files listing
binary packages; it also has a subdirectory called
source which contains any or all of Sources,
Sources.gz, Sources.bz2, and Sources.xz
files listing source packages.

The
configuration file may contain comment lines, which start
with a ’#’ character.

EXAMPLES

Show versions of the coreutils
package:

$ madison-lite
coreutils

Show versions of
all binary packages on powerpc produced by the glibc source
package:

$ madison-lite
-S -a powerpc glibc

Show versions of
all packages in the unstable suite whose names begin with
’man’:

$ madison-lite
-s unstable -r 'man.*'

An example
configuration file for a simple local mirror:

mirror
/mirror/debian 
suite unstable dists/unstable main 
suite unstable-non-US non-US/dists/unstable non-US/main
