NAME

sd_bus_set_exit_on_disconnect,
sd_bus_get_exit_on_disconnect - Control the exit behavior
when the bus object disconnects

SYNOPSIS

#include

int
sd_bus_set_exit_on_disconnect(sd_bus *bus,
int b); 

int
sd_bus_get_exit_on_disconnect(sd_bus *bus); 

DESCRIPTION

sd_bus_set_exit_on_disconnect()
may be used to configure the exit behavior when the given
bus object disconnects. If b is zero, no special
logic is executed when the bus object disconnects. If
b is non-zero, the behavior on disconnect depends on
whether the bus object is attached to an event loop or not.
If the bus object is attached to an event loop (see
sd_bus_attach_event(3)), the event loop is closed
when the bus object disconnects (as if calling
sd_event_exit(3)). Otherwise, exit(3) is
called. The exit code passed to sd_event_exit() and
exit() is EXIT_FAILURE. If the bus object has
already disconnected when enabling the exit behavior, the
exit behavior is executed immediately. By default, the exit
behavior is disabled.

sd_bus_get_exit_on_disconnect()
returns whether the exit on disconnect behavior is enabled
for the given bus object.

RETURN VALUE

On success,
sd_bus_set_exit_on_disconnect() returns a
non-negative integer. On failure, it returns a negative
errno-style error code.

sd_bus_get_exit_on_disconnect()
returns a positive integer if the exit on disconnect
behavior is enabled. Otherwise, it returns zero.

Errors

Returned errors may indicate the following problems:

-EINVAL

A required parameter was
NULL.

Added in
version 246.

-ENOPKG

The bus object could not be
resolved.

Added in
version 246.

-ECHILD

The bus connection was created
in a different process, library or module instance.

Added in
version 246.

NOTES

Functions
described here are available as a shared library, which can
be compiled against and linked to with the
libsystemd pkg-config(1) file.

The code
described here uses getenv(3), which is declared to
be not multi-thread-safe. This means that the code calling
the functions described here must not call setenv(3)
from a parallel thread. It is recommended to only do calls
to setenv() from an early phase of the program when
no other threads have been started.

HISTORY

sd_bus_set_exit_on_disconnect()
and sd_bus_get_exit_on_disconnect() were added in
version 246.
