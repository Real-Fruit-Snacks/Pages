NAME

tally.control -
Keep track of newsgroup creations and deletions

SYNOPSIS

tally.control
logfile

DESCRIPTION

tally.control
is normally daily invoked by scanlogs. It reads its
standard input, which should be the newgroup.log and
rmgroup.log control log files. They contain a summary
line describing the control message and the action taken by
controlchan, followed by the article indented by four
spaces, and a blank line. Then, tally.control updates
the cumulative list of newsgroup creations and deletions
which is kept in control.log.

All these log
files reside in the pathlog directory set in
inn.conf. In order to generate them, you need to
enable control articles logging in control.ctl(5), as
explained in the control.log entry of newslog(5).

FILES

pathbin/tally.control

The Shell script itself used to
tally newsgroup creations and deletions up.

pathlog/control.log

This file maintains a count of
the number of newgroup and rmgroup control messages seen for
each newsgroup. The count is of the number of control
messages with the indicated arguments, regardless if they
were actually processed. All control arguments, including
invalid ones, are counted. An example of lines which can be
found in that log file is:

3 Control:
newgroup foo.bar moderated 
3 Control: rmgroup misc.removed 
1 Control: newgroup misc.created
