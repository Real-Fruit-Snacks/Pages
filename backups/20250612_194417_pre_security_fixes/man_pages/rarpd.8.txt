NAME

rarpd −
Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP) daemon

SYNOPSIS

rarpd
[−aAvode] [−b bootdir]
[interface]

DESCRIPTION

Rarpd is
a daemon which responds to RARP requests. RARP is used by
some machines at boot time to discover their IP address.
They provide their Ethernet address and rarpd
responds with their IP address if it finds it in the ethers
database (either /etc/ethers file or NIS+ lookup) and
using DNS lookup if the ethers database contains a hostname
and not an IP address. In addition, /etc/hosts will
provide further means of pairing an IP address to a
hostname, in the standard fashion.

By default
rarpd also checks if a bootable image, of a name
starting with the IP address in hexadecimal upper-case
letters, is present in the TFTP boot directory before it
decides whether to respond to the RARP request. The
comparison involves exactly the first eight characters, and
ignores any additional character. A file name shorter than
eight characters in length is unsuccessful. Typically,
192.168.0.122 would correspond to an image named like
C0A8007A.SUN.

The optional
argument interface restricts the daemon instance to
access only the indicated network interface. Only a single
name is possible.

OPTIONS

−a

Do not bind to a single
interface, but listen at all configured interfaces.

−A

Respond to reverse requests received as ARP-packets, in
addition to those protocol conformant requests transmitted
as RARP-packets. See the notes for the background.

−v

Tell the user what is going on by being verbose.

−d

Debugging mode. Do not detach from the tty. This also
implies verbose mode.

−e

Skip the check for bootable images in the TFTP boot
directory. In the absence of this switch, even if the
Ethernet address is present in the ethers database, the lack
of a bootable image for the resolved IP will make
rarpd refrain from responding to requests for this
particular address.

−o

Accept offlink packages on the active interfaces.

−b
bootdir

Access bootdir instead
of the default /tftpboot as the TFTP boot directory
for bootable image checks.

OBSOLETES

This daemon
rarpd obsoletes kernel rarp daemon present in
Linux kernels up to 2.2 which was controlled by the rarp(8)
command.

SIGNALS

SIGHUP

Renew the internal address list,
which records IPv4 addresses available at each active
network interface. The restriction set by the command line
argument interface is still in effect, if in use.

NOTES

The protocol
stipulates that Reverse Requests be broadcast as RARP
packets, using a protocol number different from that in use
by ARP packets. However, there has been an obsolete practice
of transmitting also Reverse Requests in ARP packets, and
some old clients may still be around that adhere to that
practice. To activate support for such obsolete client
hosts, the switch −A must be applied. Observe,
however, that only ARP-packaged ARPOP_RREQUEST messages are
added to the servers responsabilities with the use of this
option, and that the replies to these will be sent as
ARP-packaged ARPOP_RREPLY messages.

FILES

/etc/ethers

Text data base of ethernet to
host pairs.

/etc/hosts

Text lookup table of host
names.

/etc/nsswitch.conf

Name resolver
configuration.

/tftpboot

Default boot directory.

/tftpboot/HEXADDR

Typical name of a boot image.
It is a file or a directory. The IPv4 address is translated
as eight upper-case, hexadecimal digits in the mandatory
part HEXADDR. Optionally, the name may be extended
with an arbitrary suffix.
