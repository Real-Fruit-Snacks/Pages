NAME

fsck.gfs2 -
offline GFS and GFS2 file system checker

SYNOPSIS

fsck.gfs2
[options] device

WARNING

All computers
must have the filesystem unmounted before running
fsck.gfs2. Failure to unmount from all nodes in a cluster
will likely result in filesystem corruption.

DESCRIPTION

fsck.gfs2 will
check that the GFS or GFS2 file system on a device is
structurally valid. It should not be run on a mounted file
system. If file system corruption is detected, it will
attempt to repair the file system. There is a limit to what
fsck.gfs2 can do. If important file system structures are
destroyed, such that the checker cannot determine what the
repairs should be, reparations could fail.

Other file
system checkers will not check the file system if it is
"clean" (i.e. unmounted since the last use). With
gfs2, storage may be shared among several nodes in a
cluster, and therefore problems may have been introduced on
a different computer. Therefore, fsck.gfs2 will always check
the file system unless the -p (preen) option is used, in
which case it follows special rules (see below).

fsck.gfs2 will
log a message to the system log on start and exit to aid
debugging and administration.

OPTIONS

-a

Same as the -p (preen)
option. 

-f

Force checking even if the file system seems clean.

-h

Help.

This prints out
the proper command line usage syntax.

-q

Quiet.

-n

No to all questions. By specifying this option,
fsck.gfs2 will only show the changes that would be made, but
not make any changes to the filesystem.

This option may
not be used with the -y or -p/-a
options.

-p

Automatically repair
("preen") the file system if it is dirty and safe
to do so, otherwise exit.

If the file
system has locking protocol lock_nolock, it is
considered a non-shared storage device and it is considered
safe. If the locking protocol is lock_dlm and -a or
-p was specified, the check is considered unsafe as
it cannot be determined whether the device is mounted by
other nodes in the cluster. In this case a warning is given
if any damage or dirty journals are found. The file system
should then be unmounted from all nodes in the cluster and
fsck.gfs2 should be run manually without the -a or
-p options.

This option may
not be used with the -n or -y options.

-V

Print out the program version
information. 

-v

Verbose operation.

Print more
information while running.

-y

Yes to all questions. By
specifying this option, fsck.gfs2 will not prompt before
making changes.

This option may
not be used with the -n or -p/-a
options.
