RPC_CLNT_AUTH(3)         BSD Library Functions Manual         RPC_CLNT_AUTH(3)

NAME
     auth_destroy, authnone_create, authsys_create, authsys_create_default —
     library routines for client side remote procedure call authentication

SYNOPSIS
     #include <rpc/rpc.h>

     void
     auth_destroy(AUTH *auth);

     AUTH *
     authnone_create(void);

     AUTH *
     authsys_create(const char *host, const uid_t uid, const gid_t gid,
         const int len, const gid_t *aup_gids);

     AUTH *
     authsys_create_default(void);

DESCRIPTION
     These routines are part of the RPC library that allows C language pro‐
     grams to make procedure calls on other machines across the network, with
     desired authentication.

     These routines are normally called after creating the CLIENT handle.  The
     cl_auth field of the CLIENT structure should be initialized by the AUTH
     structure returned by some of the following routines.  The client's au‐
     thentication information is passed to the server when the RPC call is
     made.

     Only the NULL and the SYS style of authentication is discussed here.

Routines
     auth_destroy()            A function macro that destroys the authentica‐
                               tion information associated with auth.  De‐
                               struction usually involves deallocation of pri‐
                               vate data structures.  The use of auth is unde‐
                               fined after calling auth_destroy().

     authnone_create()         Create and return an RPC authentication handle
                               that passes nonusable authentication informa‐
                               tion with each remote procedure call.  This is
                               the default authentication used by RPC.

     authsys_create()          Create and return an RPC authentication handle
                               that contains AUTH_SYS authentication informa‐
                               tion.  The host argument is the name of the ma‐
                               chine on which the information was created; uid
                               is the user's user ID; gid is the user's cur‐
                               rent group ID; len and aup_gids refer to a
                               counted array of groups to which the user be‐
                               longs.

     authsys_create_default()  Call authsys_create() with the appropriate ar‐
                               guments.

     These functions are part of libtirpc.
