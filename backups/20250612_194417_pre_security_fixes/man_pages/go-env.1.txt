NAME

go-env - print
Go environment information

SYNOPSIS

go env [
var ... ]

DESCRIPTION

Env prints Go
environment information.

By default env
prints information as a shell script (on Windows, a batch
file). If one or more variable names is given as arguments,
env prints the value of each named variable on its own
line.

-json

prints the environment in JSON format instead of as a
shell script.

-u

requires one or more arguments and unsets the default
setting for the named environment variables, if one has been
set with ’go env -w’.

-w

requires one or more arguments of the form NAME=VALUE
and changes the default settings of the named environment
variables to the given values.

For more about
environment variables, see ’go help
environment’.
