HME(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual HME(4)

NAME

hme — Sun
Microelectronics STP2002-STQ Ethernet interfaces device
driver

SYNOPSIS

To compile this driver into the
kernel, place the following lines in your kernel
configuration file:

device
miibus 
device hme

Alternatively,
to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following line in loader.conf(5):

if_hme_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION

The hme driver supports
Sun Microelectronics STP2002-STQ ’’Happy Meal
Ethernet’’ Fast Ethernet interfaces.

All controllers
supported by the hme driver have TCP checksum offload
capability for both receive and transmit, support for the
reception and transmission of extended frames for vlan(4)
and a 128-bit multicast hash filter.

HARDWARE

The hme driver supports
the on-board Ethernet interfaces of many Sun UltraSPARC
workstation and server models.

Cards supported
by the hme driver include:

•

Sun PCI SunSwift Adapter
(’’SUNW,hme’’)

•

Sun SBus SunSwift Adapter
(’’hme’’ and
’’SUNW,hme’’)

•

Sun PCI Sun100BaseT Adapter 2.0
(’’SUNW,hme’’)

•

Sun SBus Sun100BaseT 2.0
(’’SUNW,hme’’)

•

Sun PCI Quad FastEthernet
Controller (’’SUNW,qfe’’)

•

Sun SBus Quad FastEthernet
Controller (’’SUNW,qfe’’)

NOTES

On sparc64 the hme driver
respects the local-mac-address? system configuration
variable which can be set in the Open Firmware boot monitor
using the setenv command or by eeprom(8). If set to
’’false’’ (the default), the
hme driver will use the system’s default MAC
address for all of its devices. If set to
’’true’’, the unique MAC address of
each interface is used if present rather than the
system’s default MAC address.

Supported
interfaces having their own MAC address include on-board
versions on boards equipped with more than one Ethernet
interface and all add-on cards except the single-port SBus
versions.
