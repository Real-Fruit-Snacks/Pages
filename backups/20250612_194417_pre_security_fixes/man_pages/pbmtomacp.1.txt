NAME

pbmtomacp -
convert a PBM image to a MacPaint file

SYNOPSIS

pbmtomacp
[-left left]

[-top

[-bottom

[pbmfile]

All options can
be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix. You may use
two hyphens instead of one to designate an option. You may
use either white space or equals signs between an option
name and its value.

DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

pbmtomacp
reads a PBM image as input and produces a MacPaint file as
output.

If you do not
specify pbmfile, pbmtomacp uses Standard
Input.

The generated
file is only the data fork of a picture. You will need a
program such as mcvert to generate a Macbinary or a
BinHex file that contains the necessary information to
identify the file as a PNTG file to MacOS.

OPTIONS

In addition to
the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most
notably -quiet, see
 Common Options ),
pbmtomacp recognizes the following command line
options:

-norle

This option tells pbmtomacp not to use any run
length encoding compression in the MacPaint image it
produces. This output, while not normal, conforms to
MacPaint specifications and can be read by any MacPaint
decoder without any special settings.

The only value
of this option is testing and experimentation. The option
causes every output image to contain exactly 53072 bytes,
which is the theoretical maximum size for a MacPaint
image.

Without
-norle, MacPaint compresses the image as much as
possible and the output size depends on the nature of the
input.

-left

-right -top -bottom These
options let you define a rectangle within the image to
convert. The default is the whole file. If the specified
image is too large for a MacPaint-file, pbmtomacp
cuts the image to fit, starting at the specified top left
corner. 

These options
exist for backward compatibility with an unfortunate
original design. They do the same thing that you can do in a
more Netpbm-like way and more flexibly by processing the
input through pamcut.

HISTORY

pbmtomacp
was added to Netpbm in 1988, written by Douwe van der Schaaf
(...!mcvax!uvapsy!vdschaaf).

In 2015, Akira
Urushibata replaced the program with the current version,
using different logic and none of the original code. The new
version used the "packed PBM" facilities of the
Netpbm library and the shhopt method of command line
parsing.
