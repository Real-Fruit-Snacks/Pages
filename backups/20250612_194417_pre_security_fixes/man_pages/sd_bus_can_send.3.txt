available on the given bus. type can be any of the
SD_BUS_TYPE constants.

On failure,
sd_bus_can_send() returns a negative errno-style
error code. If values of the given type can be sent over the
given bus, it returns a positive integer. Otherwise, it
returns zero.

Returned errors may indicate the following problems:

created in a different process.

NOTES

Functions
described here are available as a shared library, which can
be compiled against and linked to with the
libsystemd pkg-config(1) file.

The code
described here uses getenv(3), which is declared to
be not multi-thread-safe. This means that the code calling
the functions described here must not call setenv(3)
from a parallel thread. It is recommended to only do calls
to setenv() from an early phase of the program when
no other threads have been started.

HISTORY

sd_bus_can_send()
was added in version 221.
