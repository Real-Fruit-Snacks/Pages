SYNOPSIS

tabbed
[-c] [-d] [-k] [-s] [-v]
[-g geometry] [-n name]
[-p [s{+/-}]pos]
[-o normbgcol] [-O normfgcol]
[-t selbgcol] [-T selfgcol]
[-u urgbgcol] [-U urgfgcol]
[-r narg] [command ...]

DESCRIPTION

tabbed
is a simple tabbed container for applications which support
XEmbed. Tabbed will then run the provided command with the
xid of tabbed as appended argument. (See EXAMPLES.) The
automatic spawning of the command can be disabled by
providing the -s parameter. If no command is provided tabbed
will just print its xid and run no command.

OPTIONS

-c

close tabbed when the last tab
is closed. Mutually exclusive with -f.

-d

detaches tabbed from the terminal and prints its XID to
stdout. 

-f

fill up tabbed again by spawning the provided command,
when the last tab is closed. Mutually exclusive with -c.

-g geometry

defines the X11 geometry
string, which will fixate the height and width of tabbed.
The syntax is
[=][width{xX}height][{+-}xoffset{+-}yoffset].
See XParseGeometry(3) for further details.

-k

close foreground tabbed client (instead of tabbed and
all clients) when WM_DELETE_WINDOW is sent.

-n name

will set the WM_CLASS attribute
to name.

-p
[s{+-}]pos

will set the absolute or
relative position of where to start a new tab. When
pos is is given without ’s’ in front it
is an absolute position. Then negative numbers will be the
position from the last tab, where -1 is the last tab. If
’s’ is given, then pos is a relative
position to the current selected tab. If this reaches the
limits of the tabs; those limits then apply.

-r narg

will replace the narg th
argument in command with the window id, rather than
appending it to the end.

-s

will disable automatic spawning of the command.

-o normbgcol

defines the normal background
color. #RGB, #RRGGBB, and X color names are
supported.

-O normfgcol

defines the normal foreground
color.

-t selbgcol

defines the selected background
color.

-T selfgbcol

defines the selected foreground
color.

-u urgbgcol

defines the urgent background
color.

-U urgfgbcol

defines the urgent foreground
color.

-v

prints version information to stderr, then exits.

CUSTOMIZATION

tabbed
by default uses Ctrl as Mod key and can be customized by
creating a custom config.h and (re)compiling the source
code. This keeps it fast, secure and simple.

Debian also
provides the tabbed.meta alternative which uses the
Windows key as Mod key.
