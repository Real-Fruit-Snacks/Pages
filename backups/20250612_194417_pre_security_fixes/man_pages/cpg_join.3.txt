NAME

cpg_join -
Joins one or more groups in the CPG library

SYNOPSIS

#include

int
cpg_join(cpg_handle_t handle, struct cpg_name
*group);

DESCRIPTION

The
cpg_join function is used to join one group. When a
group is joined, the cpg_mcast_joined(3) is called
internally to multicast to the groups joined in the argument
handle. The process will also get notifications of
other processes joining and leaving the group. Messages that
are sent to any of the groups joined to the parameter
handle will be delivered by
cpg_dispatch(3).

This function
may be only be called once for each handle. When a group has
been joined the process will start to receive callbacks
relating to messages sent from members of the group or
notifications of processes joining or leaving the group.

Note that more
than one process on each node can join a CPG group and each
will receive its own copy of any messages sent using
cpg_mcast_joined() and its own confchg callback.

The argument
group is used to specify the group to join.

The
groups argument is of the type struct cpg_name which
is defined by the structure:

struct cpg_name
{ 
int length; 
char value[128]; 
};

RETURN VALUE

This call
returns the CS_OK value if successful, CS_ERR_INVALID_PARAM
if the handle is already joined to a group.

ERRORS

Not all errors
are documented.
