NAME

fnbind −
Bind a reference to an FNS name

SYNOPSIS

fnbind
[-s] [-v] [-L] name new_name

fnbind
-r [-s] [-v] new_name [-O
| -U] ref_type { [-O | -U]
addr_type 
[-c | -x] addr_contents}...

DESCRIPTION

The
fnbind utility binds the reference named by
name to the name new_name. The second synopsis
of fnbind (uses the -r option) allows the
binding of new_name to the reference constructed
using arguments supplied in the command line.

OPTIONS

The following
options are supported:

-s

Bind to new_name even if it is already bound. If
this option is omitted, fnbind fails if
new_name is already bound.

-v

Display the reference being bound to
new_name. 

-L

Create an XFN link using name and bind it to
new_name. 

-r

Create a reference using ref_type as the
reference’s type, and one or more pairs of
addr_type and addr_contents as the
reference’s list of addresses, and bind this reference
to new_name. Unless the -O or -U
options are used, FN_ID_STRING is used as the
identifier format for ref_type and addr_type.
Unless the -c or -x options are used,
addr_contents is stored as an XDR-encoded string.

-c

Store addr_contents in the given form; do not use
XDR-encoding. 

-x

addr_contents specifies a hexadecimal string.
Convert it to its hexidecimal representation and store it;
do not use XDR-encoding.

-O

The identifier format is FN_ID_ISO_OID_STRING, an
ASN.1 dot-separated integer list string.

-U

The identifier format is FN_ID_DCE_UUID, a DCE
UUID in string form.

EXAMPLES

Example 1:
Binding a service to a printer

The command

example%
fnbind -s thisorgunit/service/printer
thisorgunit/service/pr

binds the name
thisorgunit/service/pr to the reference named by
thisorgunit/service/printer. Any reference bound to
thisorgunit/service/pr is overwritten.

Example 2:
Binding to an XFN link

The command

example%
fnbind -L thisorgunit/service/printer
thisorgunit/service/pr

binds the name
thisorgunit/service/pr to the XFN link constructed
using the name thisorgunit/service/printer .

Example 3:
Binding to an address type

The command

example%
fnbind -r thisorgunit/service/calendar SUNW_cal \

SUNW_cal_deskset_onc staff@exodus

binds the name
thisorgunit/service/calendar to the reference with
reference type SUNW_cal and address type
SUNW_cal_deskset_onc, and address contents of
staff@exodus.
