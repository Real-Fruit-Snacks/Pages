NAME

pargs âˆ’
print process arguments, environment variables, or auxiliary
vector

SYNOPSIS

pargs
[-aceFx] [pid | core] ...

DESCRIPTION

The
pargs utility examines a target process or process
core file and prints arguments, environment variables and
values, or the process auxiliary vector.

pargs
outputs unprintable characters as escaped octal in the
format \xxx, unless the character is one of
the characters specified in the "Escape
Sequences" section of formats(5), in which
case the character is printed as specified in that
section.

pargs
attempts to be sensitive to the locale of the target
process. If the target process and the pargs process
do not share a common character encoding, pargs
attempts to employ the iconv(3C) facility to generate
a printable version of the extracted strings. In the event
that such a conversion is impossible, strings are displayed
as 7-bit ASCII.

OPTIONS

The following
options are supported:

-a

Prints process arguments as contained in argv[]
(default). 

-c

Treats strings in the target process as though they were
encoded in 7-bit ASCII, regardless of the locale of
the target. The use of iconv(3C) is suppressed.

-e

Prints process environment variables and values as
pointed at by the _environ symbol or by
pr_envp in /proc/pid/psinfo.

-F

Force. Grabs the target process even if another process
has control.

-x

Prints process auxiliary vector.

OPERANDS

The following
operands are supported:

pid

Process ID list.

core

Process core file.

EXIT STATUS

The following
exit values are returned:

0

Successful operation.

non-zero

An error has occurred (such as
no such process, permission denied, or invalid option).

FILES

/proc/pid/*

Process information and control
files.
