NAME

org.freedesktop.oom1
- The D-Bus interface of systemd-oomd

INTRODUCTION

systemd-oomd.service(8)
is a system service which implements a userspace
out-of-memory (OOM) killer. This page describes the D-Bus
interface.

THE MANAGER OBJECT

The service
exposes the following interfaces on the Manager object on
the bus:

node
/org/freedesktop/oom1 { 
interface org.freedesktop.oom1.Manager { 
methods: 
DumpByFileDescriptor(out h fd); 
signals: 
Killed(s cgroup, 
s reason); 
}; 
interface org.freedesktop.DBus.Peer { ... }; 
interface org.freedesktop.DBus.Introspectable { ... }; 
interface org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties { ... }; 
};

Methods 
Killed() signal is sent when any cgroup is killed by
oomd.

Note that more
reasons will be added in the future, and the table below
will be expanded accordingly.
