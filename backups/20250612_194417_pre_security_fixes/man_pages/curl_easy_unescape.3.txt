NAME

curl_easy_unescape
- URL decodes the given string

SYNOPSIS

#include

char
*curl_easy_unescape( CURL *curl, const char
*url , int inlength, int
*outlength );

DESCRIPTION

This function
converts the given URL encoded input string to a "plain
string" and returns that in an allocated memory area.
All input characters that are URL encoded (%XX where XX is a
two-digit hexadecimal number) are converted to their binary
versions.

If the
length argument is set to 0 (zero),
curl_easy_unescape(3) will use strlen() on the input
url string to find out the size.

If
outlength is non-NULL, the function will write the
length of the returned string in the integer it points to.
This allows an escaped string containing %00 to still get
used properly after unescaping. Since this is a pointer to
an int type, it can only return a value up to INT_MAX
so no longer string can be unescaped if the string length is
returned in this parameter.

You must
curl_free(3) the returned string when youâ€™re
done with it.

AVAILABILITY

Added in 7.15.4
and replaces the old curl_unescape(3) function.

RETURN VALUE

A pointer to a
null-terminated string or NULL if it failed.
