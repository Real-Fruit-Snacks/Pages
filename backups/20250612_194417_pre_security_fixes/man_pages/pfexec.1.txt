DESCRIPTION

The
pfexec program is used to execute commands with the
attributes specified by the user’s profiles in the
exec_attr(4) database. It is invoked by the profile
shells, pfsh, pfcsh, and pfksh which
are linked to the Bourne shell, C shell, and Korn shell,
respectively.

Profiles are
searched in the order specified in the user’s entry in
the user_attr(4) database. If the same command
appears in more than one profile, the profile shell uses the
first matching entry.

is used to execute commands with predefined process
attributes, such as specific user or group IDs.

Refer to the
sh(1), csh(1), and ksh(1) man pages for
complete usage descriptions of the profile shells.
