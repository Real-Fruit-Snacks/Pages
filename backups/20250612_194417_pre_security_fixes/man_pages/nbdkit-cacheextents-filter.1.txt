NAME

nbdkit-cacheextents-filter
- cache extents

SYNOPSIS

nbdkit
--filter=cacheextents plugin

DESCRIPTION

"nbdkit-cacheextents-filter"
is a filter that caches the result of last extents()
call.

A common use
for this filter is to improve performance when using a
client performing a linear pass over the entire image while
asking for only one extent at a time (such as
"qemu-img convert"), but where the plugin can
provide multiple extents for the same high latency as a
single extent (such as nbdkit-vddk-plugin(1)). For
example:

nbdkit
--filter=cacheextents --run 'qemu-img map $nbd' vddk ...

For files with
big extents (when it is unlikely for one extents()
call to return multiple different extents) this does not
slow down the access.

This filter
only caches image metadata; to also cache image contents,
place this filter between nbdkit-cache-filter(1) and
the plugin.

PARAMETERS

There are no
parameters specific to nbdkit-cacheextents-filter. Any
parameters are passed through to and processed by the
underlying plugin in the normal way.

FILES

$filterdir/nbdkit-cacheextents-filter.so

The filter.

Use
"nbdkit --dump-config" to find the location of
$filterdir.
