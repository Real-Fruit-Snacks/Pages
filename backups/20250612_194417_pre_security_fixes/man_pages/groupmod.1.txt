NAME

groupmod
âˆ’ modify a group definition on the system

SYNOPSIS

/usr/sbin/groupmod
[ -g gid [-o]]
[-n name] group

DESCRIPTION

The
groupmod command modifies the definition of the
specified group by modifying the appropriate entry in the
/etc/group file.

OPTIONS

The following
options are supported: 
-g gid

Specify the new group ID
for the group. This group ID must be a non-negative
decimal integer less than MAXUID, as defined in
. The group ID defaults to the
next available (unique) number above 99. (Group IDs from
0-99 are reserved by SunOS for future applications.)

-n name

Specify the new name for the
group. The name argument is a string of no more than
eight bytes consisting of characters from the set of lower
case alphabetic characters and numeric characters. 
A warning message will be written if these restrictions are
not met. A future Solaris release may refuse to accept group
fields that do not meet these requirements. The name
argument must contain at least one character and must not
include a colon (:) or NEWLINE
(\n).

-o

Allow the gid to be duplicated (non-unique).

OPERANDS

The following
operands are supported:

group

An existing group name to be
modified.

groupmod utility exits with one of the following
values:

0

Success.

2

Invalid command syntax. A usage message for the
groupmod command is displayed.

3

4

gid is not unique (when the -o option is
not used).

6

NOTES

The
groupmod utility only modifies group definitions in
the /etc/group file. If a network name service such
as NIS or NIS+ is being used to supplement the
local /etc/group file with additional entries,
groupmod cannot change information supplied by the
network name service. The groupmod utility will,
however, verify the uniqueness of group name and group
ID against the external name service.
