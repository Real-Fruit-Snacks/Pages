NAME

gh-auth-refresh
- Refresh stored authentication credentials

SYNOPSIS

gh auth
refresh [flags]

DESCRIPTION

Expand or fix
the permission scopes for stored credentials for active
account.

The
--scopes flag accepts a comma separated list of
scopes you want your gh credentials to have. If no scopes
are provided, the command maintains previously added
scopes.

The
--remove-scopes flag accepts a comma separated list
of scopes you want to remove from your gh credentials. Scope
removal is idempotent. The minimum set of scopes
(repo, read:org, and gist) cannot be
removed.

The
--reset-scopes flag resets the scopes for your gh
credentials to the default set of scopes for your auth
flow.

If you have
multiple accounts in gh auth status and want to
refresh the credentials for an inactive account, you will
have to use gh auth switch to that account first
before using this command, and then switch back when you are
done.
