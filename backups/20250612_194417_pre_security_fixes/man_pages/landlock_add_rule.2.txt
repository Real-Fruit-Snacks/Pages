landlock_add_rule(2)          System Calls Manual         landlock_add_rule(2)

NAME
       landlock_add_rule - add a new Landlock rule to a ruleset

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <linux/landlock.h>  /* Definition of LANDLOCK_* constants */
       #include <sys/syscall.h>     /* Definition of SYS_* constants */

       int syscall(SYS_landlock_add_rule, int ruleset_fd,
                   enum landlock_rule_type rule_type,
                   const void *rule_attr, uint32_t flags);

DESCRIPTION
       A  Landlock  rule  describes an action on an object.  An object is cur‐
       rently a file hierarchy, and the related filesystem actions are defined
       with  a set of access rights.  This landlock_add_rule() system call en‐
       ables adding a new Landlock rule to an existing  ruleset  created  with
       landlock_create_ruleset(2).  See landlock(7) for a global overview.

       ruleset_fd  is  a  Landlock ruleset file descriptor obtained with land‐
       lock_create_ruleset(2).

       rule_type identifies the structure type pointed to by rule_attr.   Cur‐
       rently, Linux supports the following rule_type value:

       LANDLOCK_RULE_PATH_BENEATH
              This defines the object type as a file hierarchy.  In this case,
              rule_attr points to the following structure:

                  struct landlock_path_beneath_attr {
                      __u64 allowed_access;
                      __s32 parent_fd;
                  } __attribute__((packed));

              allowed_access contains a bitmask of allowed filesystem  actions
              for this file hierarchy (see Filesystem actions in landlock(7)).

              parent_fd  is  an  opened  file  descriptor, preferably with the
              O_PATH flag, which identifies the parent directory of  the  file
              hierarchy or just a file.

       flags must be 0.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, landlock_add_rule() returns 0.

ERRORS
       landlock_add_rule() can failed for the following reasons:

       EOPNOTSUPP
              Landlock is supported by the kernel but disabled at boot time.

       EINVAL flags  is  not  0,  or the rule accesses are inconsistent (i.e.,
              rule_attr->allowed_access is not a subset of the ruleset handled
              accesses).

       ENOMSG Empty accesses (i.e., rule_attr->allowed_access is 0).

       EBADF  ruleset_fd is not a file descriptor for the current thread, or a
              member of rule_attr is not a file descriptor as expected.

       EBADFD ruleset_fd is not a ruleset file  descriptor,  or  a  member  of
              rule_attr is not the expected file descriptor type.

       EPERM  ruleset_fd has no write access to the underlying ruleset.

       EFAULT rule_attr was not a valid address.

VERSIONS
       Landlock was added in Linux 5.13.

STANDARDS
       This system call is Linux-specific.
