NAME

ncpumount
âˆ’ unmount a NetWare filesystem mounted with
ncpmount.

SYNOPSIS

ncpumount
mount-point

DESCRIPTION

This utility
unmounts a NetWare filesystem that was previously mounted
with the ncpmount utility. If the this utility is made suid
root then non-root users will also be able to make use of
it.

ncpumount
has been written to give normal linux-users more control
over their resources. It is safe to install this program
suid root, because only the user who has mounted a
filesystem is allowed to unmount it again.

For root it is
not necessary to use ncpumount. The normal umount program
works perfectly well, but it would certainly be problematic
to make umount setuid root.

OPTIONS

mount-point is the
