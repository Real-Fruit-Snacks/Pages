NAME

pmdasimple
- simple performance metrics domain agent (PMDA)

SYNOPSIS

$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/simple/pmdasimple
[-d domain] [-i port] [-l
logfile] [-p] [-u socket]
[-U username]

DESCRIPTION

pmdasimple
is a simple Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
exports a small number of synthetic performance metrics.

The simple PMDA
is shipped as source code and is designed to be an aid for
PMDA developers. In terms of code size and features, it is
more complex than the trivial PMDA, about the same as the
txmon PMDA and less complex than the sample PMDA. The source
for the simple PMDA is a good template from which
production, customized PMDAs can be developed.

A brief
description of the pmdasimple command line options
follows:

-d

It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics
domain number specified here is unique and
consistent. That is, domain should be different for
every PMDA on the one host, and the same domain
number should be used for the same PMDA on all hosts.

-i

Expect PMCD to connect to pmdasimple on the
specified TCP/IP port. port may be a port number or
port name.

-l

Location of the log file. By default, a log file named
simple.log is written in the current directory of
pmcd(1) when pmdasimple is started, i.e.
$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd. If the log file cannot be created
or is not writable, output is written to the standard error
instead. 

-p

Expect PMCD to create a pipe and the connection to
pmdasimple is via standard input and standard output.
This is the default connection mode.

-u

Expect PMCD to connect to pmdasimple on the Unix
domain socket named socket.

-U

User account under which to run the agent. The default
is the unprivileged "pcp" account in current
versions of PCP, but in older versions the superuser account
("root") was used by default.

At most one of
the options -i, -p and -u may be
specified.

INSTALLATION

If you want
access the names, help text and values for the simple
performance metrics, do the following as root:

# cd
$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/simple 
# ./Install

If you want to
undo the installation, do the following as root:

# cd
$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/simple 
# ./Remove

pmdasimple
is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be executed
directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify
pmcd(1) when the agent is installed or removed.

FILES

$PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH

command line options used to
launch pmdasimple

$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/simple/help

default help text file for the
simple metrics

$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/simple/Install

installation script for the
pmdasimple agent

$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/simple/Remove

undo installation script for
the pmdasimple agent

$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/simple/simple.conf

configuration file for the
dynamic instance domain that underlies the simple.now
performance metric. For a description, refer to the help
text file, or run the command 
$ pminfo -T simple.now

$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/simple/*.pmda_simple.so

The DSO version of the PMDA.
The same source is used to create both the DSO and the
daemon versions of the simple PMDA, and one or the other may
be installed as part of the dialog in the Install
script.

$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/simple.log

default log file for error
messages and other information from pmdasimple

PCP ENVIRONMENT

Environment
variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On
each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains
the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).
