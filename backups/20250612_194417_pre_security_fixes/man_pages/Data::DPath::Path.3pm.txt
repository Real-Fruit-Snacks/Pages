NAME
       Data::DPath::Path - Abstraction for a DPath

ABOUT
       Take a string description, parse it, provide frontend methods.

PUBLIC METHODS
   new ( %args )
       Constructor; creates instance.

       Args:

       give_references
           Default 0. If set to true value then results are references to the
           matched points in the data structure.

   match( $data )
       Returns an array of all values in $data that match the Path object.

   matchr( $data )
       Returns an array ref of all values in $data that match the Path object.

INTERNAL METHODS
   op_match( $self, $data )
       This sub/method is bound as the overloading function for "~~".

   quoted
       Checks whether a path part starts with quotes.

   unquote
       Removes surrounding quotes.

   unescape
       Converts backslashed characters into their non-backslashed form.

   _build__steps
       This method is essentially the DPath parser as it tokenizes the path
       into single steps whose later execution is the base functionality of
       the whole DPath module.

   path
       Attribute / accessor.

   _steps
       Attribute / accessor.

   give_references
       Attribute / accessor.

aliased classes
       That's just to make Pod::Coverage happy which does not handle aliased
       modules.

   Context
