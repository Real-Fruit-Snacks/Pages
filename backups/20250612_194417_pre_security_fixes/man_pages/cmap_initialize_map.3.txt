NAME

cmap_initialize_map
- Initialize CMAP API with a specific map

SYNOPSIS

#include

cs_error_t
cmap_initialize_map (cmap_handle_t *handle,
cmap_map_t map);

DESCRIPTION

The
cmap_initialize_map function is used to initialize a
connection to the Configuration Map API and specify a
particular map to use. Each application may have several
connections to the CMAP API and to different maps. Each
application uses the handle argument to uniquely
identify the connection. The handle argument is then
used in other function calls to identify the connection to
be used for communication with the CMAP service.

The map
argument specifies which map to connect to.
CMAP_MAP_ICMAP is the configuration map that
contains the current corosyn cconfiguraton and some runtime
variables that maybe useful to external agents.
CMAP_MAP_STATS is the statistics map that contains
detailed information about network and inter-process
communications.

RETURN VALUE

This call
returns the CS_OK value if successful, otherwise an error is
returned.
