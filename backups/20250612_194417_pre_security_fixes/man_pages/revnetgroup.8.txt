NAME

revnetgroup -
generate reverse netgroup data

SYNOPSIS

/usr/lib/yp/revnetgroup
[-u | -h]

DESCRIPTION

Revnetgroup
processes the standard input in netgroup(5) format
into what is called reverse netgroup form. That is,
where the original file shows netgroup memberships in terms
of which members reside in a particular group, the reverse
netgroup format specifies what groups are associated with a
particular member. This information is used to generate the
netgroup.byuser and netgroup.byhosts NIS maps. These reverse
netgroup maps are used to help speed up netgroup lookups,
particularly for the innetgr() library function.

The
revnetgroup command prints its results on the
standard output. It is usually called only by
/var/yp/Makefile when rebuilding the NIS netgroup maps.

OPTIONS

-u

Generate netgroup.byuser
output; only username information in the original netgroup
file is processed.

-h

Generate netgroup.byhost
output; only hostname information in the original netgroup
file is processed.

FILES

/var/yp/Makefile

The Makefile to build the NIS
databases.

/etc/netgroup

The default netgroup database
file. This file is most often found only on the NIS master
server.
