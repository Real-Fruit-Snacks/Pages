NAME

nbdkit-truncate-filter
- change the size of plugins

SYNOPSIS

nbdkit
--filter=truncate plugin [truncate=SIZE] 
[round-up=N] [round-down=N]

DESCRIPTION

"nbdkit-truncate-filter"
is a filter that changes the size of the underlying plugin.
It can:

•

Make the plugin smaller (truncate it). Use the
"truncate=SIZE" parameter to set the smaller
size. 

•

Make the plugin larger (the additional bytes read back
as zeroes). Use "truncate=SIZE" to set the larger
size. 

•

Round the size of the plugin up or down to the next
multiple of "N". Use either "round-up=N"
or "round-down=N".

A common use
for this filter is to handle NBD clients which have a
problem dealing with device sizes which are not a multiple
of 512 bytes. Use "round-up=512" to round the size
up to the next multiple of 512 bytes. If the size is already
a multiple of 512 bytes then this has no effect.

PARAMETERS

truncate=SIZE

Set the absolute size in bytes
of the apparent device. This may be smaller or larger or the
same as the underlying plugin.

If the size is
larger than the underlying plugin, reading the extra space
returns zeroes. Writes are also permitted to the extra
space, but you must only write zeroes (any attempts to write
non-zero bytes will return an error back to the client).

This parameter
is optional.

round-up=N

Round the size up to the next
multiple of "N" bytes. If the size of the
underlying plugin is already a multiple of "N"
bytes, this has no effect.

This option is
useful when combined with other filters (such as
nbdkit-blocksize-filter(1)) that normally round down
due to a larger granularity, in order to access the last few
bytes of a file that would otherwise be rendered
inaccessible.

This parameter
is optional.

round-down=N

Round the size down to a
multiple of "N" bytes. If the size of the
underlying plugin is already a multiple of "N"
bytes, this has no effect.

This parameter
is optional.

EXAMPLES

Serve a file as
if it were a block device that insists on 4k alignment,
while still allowing access to any unaligned bytes at the
end of the file:

nbdkit
--filter=blocksize --filter=truncate file /path/to/file \

minblock=4k round-up=4k

FILES

$filterdir/nbdkit-truncate-filter.so

The filter.

Use
"nbdkit --dump-config" to find the location of
$filterdir.
