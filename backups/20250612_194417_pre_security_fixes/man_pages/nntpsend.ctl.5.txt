NAME

nntpsend.ctl -
List of sites to feed via nntpsend

DESCRIPTION

The file
pathetc/nntpsend.ctl specifies the default list of
sites to be fed by nntpsend. Comments begin with a
number sign ("#") and continue through the end of
the line. Blank lines and comments are ignored. All other
lines should consist of four fields separated by a
colon.

The first field
is the name of the site as specified in the newsfeeds
file.

The second
field should be the hostname or IP address of the remote
site.

The third
field, if non-empty, specifies the default head truncation
size of the batch file. If this field is empty, no
truncation is performed. This field may be of the form
"maxsize-truncsize", in which case
it is passed to shrinkfile as "-m maxsize
-s truncsize"; otherwise it is of the form
"truncsize", in which case it is passed as
"-s truncsize".

The fourth
field specifies some default flags passed to innxmit.
Note that the flag -a is always given to
innxmit and need not appear here. If no -t
flag is given in this field or on the nntpsend
command line, "-t 180" will be given to
innxmit.

See nntpsend(8)
for an example of nntpsend.ctl config file.
