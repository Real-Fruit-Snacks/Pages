NAME

pmdatrivial
- trivial performance metrics domain agent (PMDA)

SYNOPSIS

$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/trivial/pmdatrivial
[-d domain] [-l logfile]
[-U username]

DESCRIPTION

pmdatrivial
is the simplest possible Performance Metrics Domain Agent
(PMDA) which exports a single performance metric, the time
in seconds since the 1st of January, 1970.

The trivial
PMDA is shipped as source code and is designed to be an aid
for PMDA developers.

A brief
description of the pmdatrivial command line options
follows:

-d

It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics
domain number specified here is unique and
consistent. That is, domain should be different for
every PMDA on the one host, and the same domain
number should be used for the same PMDA on all hosts.

-l

Location of the log file. By default, a log file named
trivial.log is written in the current directory of
pmcd(1) when pmdatrivial is started, i.e.
$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd. If the log file cannot be created
or is not writable, output is written to the standard error
instead. 

-U

User account under which to run the agent. The default
is the unprivileged "pcp" account in current
versions of PCP, but in older versions the superuser account
("root") was used by default.

INSTALLATION

If you want
access to the names, help text and values for the trivial
performance metrics, do the following as root:

# cd
$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/trivial 
# ./Install

If you want to
undo the installation, do the following as root:

# cd
$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/trivial 
# ./Remove

pmdatrivial
is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be executed
directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify
pmcd(1) when the agent is installed or removed.

FILES

$PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH

command line options used to
launch pmdatrivial

$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/trivial/help

default help text file for the
trivial metrics

$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/trivial/Install

installation script for the
pmdatrivial agent

$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/trivial/Remove

PCP ENVIRONMENT

Environment
variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On
each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains
the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).
