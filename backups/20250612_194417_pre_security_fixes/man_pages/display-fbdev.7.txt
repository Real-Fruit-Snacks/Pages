NAME

display-fbdev
: Display using Linux kernel framebuffer devices

SYNOPSIS

display-fbdev:
[ [-noinput] | [ [-nokbd] | [-nomouse] ] ] [-novt] 
[-physz=,[dpi]]
[]

DESCRIPTION

Uses the Linux
/dev/fb* devices to do fullscreen graphics.

When using a
regular fbdev driver, /etc/fb.modes is used to
determine the available modes for the device. Driver timings
and resolutions can be automatically obtained when running
under KGIcon.

OPTIONS

framebuffer

The filename of the framebuffer
target to use. The default is to get it from the
FRAMEBUFFER environment, or the framebuffer
associated with the current console if that is unset.

-nokbd

Do not open any libraries for keyboard input.

-nomouse

Do not open any libraries for
mouse input.

-noinput

Same as both -nokbd and
-nomouse.

-novt

Disable virtual console support.

-physz=,[dpi]

This option will provide a
physical screen size for applications which wish to remain
resolution independent. sizex,:p:sizey are the
x,y size of the screen in millimeters, unless the optional
dpi string is affixed, in which case, they represent
resolution in dots-per-inch.
