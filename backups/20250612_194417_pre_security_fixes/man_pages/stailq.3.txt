DESCRIPTION

These macros
define and operate on singly linked tail queues.

In the macro
definitions, TYPE is the name of a user-defined
structure, that must contain a field of type
STAILQ_ENTRY, named NAME. The argument
HEADNAME is the name of a user-defined structure that
must be declared using the macro STAILQ_HEAD().

A singly linked
tail queue is headed by a structure defined by the
STAILQ_HEAD() macro. This structure contains a pair
of pointers, one to the first element in the tail queue and
the other to the last element in the tail queue. The
elements are singly linked for minimum space and pointer
manipulation overhead at the expense of O(n) removal for
arbitrary elements. New elements can be added to the tail
queue after an existing element, at the head of the tail
queue, or at the end of the tail queue. A STAILQ_HEAD
structure is declared as follows:

STAILQ_HEAD(HEADNAME, TYPE) head;

where struct
HEADNAME is the structure to be defined, and struct
TYPE is the type of the elements to be linked into the
tail queue. A pointer to the head of the tail queue can
later be declared as:

struct HEADNAME *headp;

(The names
head and headp are user selectable.)

The macro
STAILQ_HEAD_INITIALIZER() evaluates to an initializer
for the tail queue head.

The macro
STAILQ_CONCAT() concatenates the tail queue headed by
head2 onto the end of the one headed by head1
removing all entries from the former.

The macro
STAILQ_EMPTY() evaluates to true if there are no
items on the tail queue.

The macro
STAILQ_ENTRY() declares a structure that connects the
elements in the tail queue.

The macro
STAILQ_FIRST() returns the first item on the tail
queue or NULL if the tail queue is empty.

The macro
STAILQ_FOREACH() traverses the tail queue referenced
by head in the forward direction, assigning each
element in turn to var.

The macro
STAILQ_INIT() initializes the tail queue referenced
by head.

The macro
STAILQ_INSERT_HEAD() inserts the new element
elm at the head of the tail queue.

The macro
STAILQ_INSERT_TAIL() inserts the new element
elm at the end of the tail queue.

The macro
STAILQ_INSERT_AFTER() inserts the new element
elm after the element listelm.

The macro
STAILQ_NEXT() returns the next item on the tail
queue, or NULL this item is the last.

The macro
STAILQ_REMOVE_HEAD() removes the element at the head
of the tail queue. For optimum efficiency, elements being
removed from the head of the tail queue should use this
macro explicitly rather than the generic
STAILQ_REMOVE() macro.

The macro
STAILQ_REMOVE() removes the element elm from
the tail queue.

RETURN VALUE

STAILQ_EMPTY()
returns nonzero if the queue is empty, and zero if the queue
contains at least one entry.

STAILQ_FIRST(),
and STAILQ_NEXT() return a pointer to the first or
next TYPE structure, respectively.

STAILQ_HEAD_INITIALIZER()
returns an initializer that can be assigned to the queue
head.

CONFORMING TO

Not in POSIX.1,
POSIX.1-2001 or POSIX.1-2008. Present on the BSDs (STAILQ
macros first appeared in 4.4BSD).

BUGS

The macro
STAILQ_FOREACH() doesn’t allow var to be
removed or freed within the loop, as it would interfere with
the traversal. The macro STAILQ_FOREACH_SAFE(), which
is present on the BSDs but is not present in glibc, fixes
this limitation by allowing var to safely be removed
from the list and freed from within the loop without
interfering with the traversal.

    free(n2);

    n3 = STAILQ_FIRST(&head);
    STAILQ_REMOVE_HEAD(&head, entries); /* Deletion from the head. */
    free(n3);

    n1 = STAILQ_FIRST(&head);
    n1->data = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i data = i;
    }
                                        /* Forward traversal. */
    STAILQ_FOREACH(np, &head, entries)
        printf("%i\n", np->data);
                                        /* TailQ Deletion. */
    n1 = STAILQ_FIRST(&head);
    while (n1 != NULL) {
        n2 = STAILQ_NEXT(n1, entries);
        free(n1);
        n1 = n2;
    }
    STAILQ_INIT(&head);

    exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
