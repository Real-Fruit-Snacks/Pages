NAME

atmarpd -
ATMARP demon

SYNOPSIS

atmarpd
[-b] [-d] [-D directory]
[-l logfile] [-m] [-n]

atmarpd -V

DESCRIPTION

atmarpd
implements the ATMARP protocol as specified in RFC1577 and
RFC1755. Address resolution requests are sent from the
kernel (using a comparably simple protocol) to the ATMARP
demon, which then performs the dialog with the network.

atmarpd
can operate as an ATMARP client and as an ATMARP server. If
also supports the concurrent use of several IP over ATM
interfaces.

atmarpd
is configured from the command line using the atmarp
program. Unless debugging is enabled, the ATMARP table is
written after every change to the file
/var/run/atmarpd.table (or to a file with the same
name in a different directory, if the -D option is
used).

Note that
atmarpd disables support for SVCs if signaling is not
available at start time, i.e. if atmsigd is not
running.

OPTIONS

-b

Run in background (i.e. in a
forked child process) after initializing.

-d

Enables (lots of) debugging output. By default,
atmarpd is comparably quiet.

-D dump_dir

Changes the directory where
atmarpd writes its table (atmarpd.table). By
default, /var/run is used.

-l logfile

Write diagnostic messages to
the specified file instead of to standard error. The special
name syslog is used to send diagnostics to the system
logger.

-m

Enables merging of incoming calls if the address is
known. An incoming connection on which no InARP reply has
been received yet, but which originates from an ATM address
for which an ATMARP entry already exists, is automatically
added to that entry. This assumes that there is a 1:1
mapping between IP addresses and ATMARP addresses. By
default, this assumption is not made, which frequently
results in the setup of duplicate connections. Note that
RFC1577 requires that an ATMARP server sends an InARP
request on an incoming connection. Merging may therefore
violate RFC1577 in this case.

-n

Prints addresses in numeric format only, i.e. no address
to name translation is attempted.

-V

Prints the version number of atmarpd on standard
output and exits.

FILES

/var/run/atmarpd.table 

ATMARP table

/proc/atm/arp

table of currently active IP over ATM VCs

BUGS

atmarpd
removes ATMARP entries from the kernel table while
refreshing them.
