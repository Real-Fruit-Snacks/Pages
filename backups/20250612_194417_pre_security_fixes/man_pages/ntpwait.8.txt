NAME

ntpwait - wait
for ntpd to stabilize the system clock

SYNOPSIS

ntpwait [-vV]
[-n number] [-s secs]

DESCRIPTION

The ntpwait
program blocks until ntpd is in synchronized state. This can
be useful at boot time, to delay the boot sequence until
after "ntpd -g" has set the time.

ntpwait will
send at most number queries to ntpd(8), sleeping for
secs seconds after each status return that says
ntpd(8) has not yet produced a synchronized and stable
system clock.

ntpwait will do
this quietly, unless the -v flag is provided.

OPTIONS

-n
number, --tries=number

Number of times to check ntpd.
This option takes an integer number as its argument. The
default number for this option is: 100.

The maximum
number of times we will check ntpd to see if it has
been able to synchronize and stabilize the system clock.

-s
secs-between-tries,
--sleep=secs-between-tries

How long to sleep between
tries. This option takes an integer number as its argument.
The default secs-between-tries for this option is:
6.

We will sleep
for secs-between-tries after each query of
ntpd that returns "the time is not yet
stable".

-v,
--verbose

Be verbose.

By default,
ntpwait is silent. With this option, ntpwait will provide
status information, including time to synchronization in
seconds.

-V,
--version

Print the version string and
exit.

EXIT STATUS

One of the
following exit values will be returned:

0

Successful program
execution.

1

The operation failed or the
command syntax was not valid.

2

Operation was interrupted by
signal.
