DESCRIPTION

As part of the
Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) API (see
PMDA(3)), pmdaPMID is the generic callback for
translating a dynamic metric name into a PMID
(pmid).

Because
implementing dynamic performance metrics requires specific
PMDA support, and the facility is an optional component of a
PMDA (most PMDAs do not support dynamic performance
metrics), pmdaPMID is a skeleton implementation that
returns PM_ERR_NAME.

A PMDA that
supports dynamic performance metrics will provide a private
callback that replaces pmdaPMID (by assignment to
version.four.pmid of the pmdaInterface
structure) and implements the translation from a dynamic
performance metric name into the associated
pmid.

CAVEAT

The PMDA must
be using PMDA_PROTOCOL_4 or later, as specified in
the call to pmdaDSO(3) or pmdaDaemon(3).

DIAGNOSTICS

pmdaPMID
returns PM_ERR_NAME if the name is not recognized or
cannot be translated, else returns 0.
