NAME

systemd-mountfsd.service,
systemd-mountfsd - Disk Image File System Mount Service

SYNOPSIS

systemd-mountfsd.service

/usr/lib/systemd/systemd-mountfsd

DESCRIPTION

systemd-mountfsd
is a system service that dissects disk images, and returns
mount file descriptors for the file systems contained
therein to clients, via a Varlink IPC API.

The disk images
provided must contain a raw file system image or must follow
the Discoverable Partitions
Specification
[1]
. Before mounting any file systems
authenticity of the disk image is established in one or a
combination of the following ways:

1.
If the disk image is located in a regular file in one of the
directories /var/lib/machines/, /var/lib/portables/,
/var/lib/extensions/, /var/lib/confexts/ or their
counterparts in the /etc/, /run/, /usr/lib/ it is assumed to
be trusted.

2.
If the disk image contains a Verity enabled disk image,
along with a signature partition with a key in the kernel
keyring or in /etc/verity.d/ (and related directories) the
disk image is considered trusted.

This
service provides one
Varlink
[2]
service:
io.systemd.MountFileSystem which accepts a file
descriptor to a regular file or block device, and returns a
number of file descriptors referring to an fsmount()
file descriptor the client may then attach to a path of
their choice.

The
returned mounts are automatically allowlisted in the
per-user-namespace allowlist maintained by
systemd-nsresourced.service(8).

The
file systems are automatically fsck'ed before
mounting.
