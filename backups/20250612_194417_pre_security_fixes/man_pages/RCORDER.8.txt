NAME

rcorder — print a
dependency ordering of interdependent files

SYNOPSIS

rcorder
[−k keep]
[−s skip] file ...

DESCRIPTION

The rcorder utility is
designed to print out a dependency ordering of a set of
interdependent files. Typically it is used to find an
execution sequence for a set of shell scripts in which
certain files must be executed before others.

Each file passed
to rcorder must be annotated with special lines
(which look like comments to the shell) which indicate the
dependencies the files have upon certain points in the
sequence, known as ’’conditions’’,
and which indicate, for each file, which
’’conditions’’ may be expected to be
filled by that file.

Within each
file, a block containing a series of
’’REQUIRE’’,
’’PROVIDE’’,
’’BEFORE’’ and
’’KEYWORD’’ lines must appear. The
format of the lines is rigid. Each line must begin with a
single ’#’, followed by a single space, followed
by ’’PROVIDE:’’,
’’REQUIRE:’’,
’’BEFORE:’’, or
’’KEYWORD:’’. No deviation is
permitted. Each dependency line is then followed by a series
of conditions, separated by whitespace. Multiple
’’PROVIDE’’,
’’REQUIRE’’,
’’BEFORE’’ and
’’KEYWORD’’ lines may appear, but
all such lines must appear in a sequence without any
intervening lines, as once a line that does not follow the
format is reached, parsing stops.

The options are
as follows:

−k

Add the
specified keyword to the ’’keep
list’’. If any −k option is given,
only those files containing the matching keyword are
listed.

−s

Add the
specified keyword to the ’’skip
list’’. If any −s option is given,
files containing the matching keyword are not listed.

An example block
follows:

# REQUIRE:
networking syslog 
# REQUIRE: usr 
# PROVIDE: dns nscd

This block
states that the file in which it appears depends upon the
’’networking’’,
’’syslog’’, and
’’usr’’ conditions, and provides the
’’dns’’ and
’’nscd’’ conditions.

A file may
contain zero ’’PROVIDE’’ lines, in
which case it provides no conditions, and may contain zero
’’REQUIRE’’ lines, in which case it
has no dependencies. There must be at least one file with no
dependencies in the set of arguments passed to
rcorder in order for it to find a starting place in
the dependency ordering.

DIAGNOSTICS

The rcorder utility may
print one of the following error messages and exit with a
non-zero status if it encounters an error while processing
the file list.

Requirement
%s has no providers, aborting.  No file has a
’’PROVIDE’’ line corresponding to a
condition present in a ’’REQUIRE’’
line in another file.

Circular
dependency on provision %s, aborting.  A set of
files has a circular dependency which was detected while
processing the stated condition.

Circular
dependency on file %s, aborting.  A set of files
has a circular dependency which was detected while
processing the stated file.
