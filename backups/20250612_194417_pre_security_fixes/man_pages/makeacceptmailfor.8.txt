NAME

makeacceptmailfor
- Create /etc/courier/esmtpacceptmailfor.dat

SYNOPSIS

makeacceptmailfor

DESCRIPTION

makeacceptmailfor
reads /etc/courier/esmtpacceptmailfor.dir and creates
/etc/courier/esmtpacceptmailfor.dat which is a binary
database file. /etc/courier/esmtpacceptmailfor.dat is a list
of domains that the Courier mail server accepts mail for,
via ESMTP. /etc/courier/esmtpacceptmailfor.dir is a
subdirectory containing one or more files. Each file in this
subdirectory is plain text file, containing a list of mail
domains, one per line, in lowercase. All files in the
subdirectory are concatenated, and the binary database file
is created from the result.

The
makeacceptmailfor can be executed while the Courier
mail server is running, and any changes take effect
immediately. However, only one instance of
makeacceptmailfor can be executed at the same
time.
