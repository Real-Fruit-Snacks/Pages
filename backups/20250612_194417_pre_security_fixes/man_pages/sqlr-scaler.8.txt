NAME

sqlr-scaler
− fire up new connections on demand

SYNOPSIS

sqlr-scaler
[−id ID] [−config
CONFIGFILE]

DESCRIPTION

You can start
as many sqlr-connection daemons as you like. If you
start fewer than the maximum number defined for the
ID, the sqlr-scaler daemon will fire up new
connections on demand. The new connections will time out
after a period of inactivity and shut down on their own.

OPTIONS

CONFIGFILE
is the filename of the configuration file to use. The
default configuration file is /etc/sqlrelay.conf.

ID is
the same as the ID argument in the
sqlr-connection daemon and associates a scaler with a
pool of connections.

Only one scaler
needs to be established for a given ID.
