NAME

nbd_aio_is_negotiating
- check if connection is ready to send handshake option

SYNOPSIS

#include

int nbd_aio_is_negotiating ( 
struct nbd_handle *h 
);

DESCRIPTION

Return true if
this connection is ready to start another option negotiation
command while handshaking with the server. An option command
will move back to the connecting state (see
nbd_aio_is_connecting(3)). Note that this state
cannot be reached unless requested by
nbd_set_opt_mode(3), and even then it only works with
newstyle servers; an oldstyle server will skip straight to
nbd_aio_is_ready(3).

RETURN VALUE

This call
returns a boolean value.

ERRORS

This function
does not fail.

The following
parameters must not be NULL: "h". For more
information see "Non-NULL parameters" in
libnbd(3).

VERSION

This function
first appeared in libnbd 1.4.

If you need to
test if this function is available at compile time check if
the following macro is defined:

#define
LIBNBD_HAVE_NBD_AIO_IS_NEGOTIATING 1
