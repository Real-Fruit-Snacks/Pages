NAME

metaxref -
builds cross-reference file/unit/item information

SYNOPSIS

metaxref
[ -dhkmsV ] [ -f manifest ] [ -L
dir ]

DESCRIPTION

Metaxref
is a program that scans all the files in your MANIFEST file
and produces three files which contains information about
how the files in that MANIFEST reference items defined by
metaconfig’s unit files.

The first two
files, I.fui and I.uif reference the
file, unit and items sorted
differently. The third file, Obsolete, dumps all the
known obsolete symbols, in which file they appear and the
new symbol that should be used instead.

Note that
obsolete symbols do not appear in the main cross-reference
files, but are only listed in the Obsolete file.
That’s yet another incentive to use the new symbols in
your sources. :-)

OPTIONS

Metaxref
recognizes the following options:

-d

Turn on debug mode.

-f manifest

Use an alternate
manifest file.

-h

Print help message and exit.

-k

Keep temporary .MT directory.

-m

Assume lots of memory and swap space. This will
drastically improve the symbol lookup time in your source
files, at the expense of memory usage.

-s

Turn on silent mode.

-L dir

Override default library location (where the U
units directory can be found).

-V

Print version number and exit.

-X file

When examining the source files, ignore any symbols
listed in the file. This is useful in situations
where a particular unit is known not to be needed for your
package’s portability targets, but your source files
nevertheless contain occurrences of words that look to
metaconfig like symbols defined in that unit. (For
example, you might need the word "index" in a
source file, but not need the unit that determines whether
strcpy or index should be used.) The
file can contain blank lines, comment lines
introduced with ’#’, and lines containing a
single symbol. If this option is not supplied, any variable
in .package is honored instead.

FILES

LIB/dist/mcon/U/*.U

Public unit files.

U/*.U

Private unit files

I.fui

Lists information sorted by file, unit and item.

I.uif

Lists information sorted by unit, item and file.

Obsolete

Lists all the obsolete symbols used by the sources.

where LIB is
/usr/share/dist.

BUGS

Metaxref will
list among the wanted items all those magic symbols defined
within units on the ?M: lines. Those are relevant only when
metaconfig is invoked with the -M option.
