XtOffset(3)                      XT FUNCTIONS                      XtOffset(3)

NAME
       XtOffset, XtOffsetOf, XtNumber - determine the byte offset or number of
       array elements

SYNTAX
       #include <X11/Intrinsic.h>

       Cardinal XtOffset(Type pointer_type, Field field_name);

       Cardinal XtOffsetOf(Type structure_type, Field field_name);

       Cardinal XtNumber(ArrayVariable array);

ARGUMENTS
       array     Specifies a fixed-size array.

       field_name
                 Specifies the name of the field for which to calculate the
                 byte offset.

       pointer_type
                 Specifies a type that is declared as a pointer to the struc-
                 ture.

       structure_type
                 Specifies a type that is declared as a structure.

DESCRIPTION
       The XtOffset macro is usually used to determine the offset of various
       resource fields from the beginning of a widget and can be used at com-
       pile time in static initializations.

       The XtOffsetOf macro expands to a constant expression that gives the
       offset in bytes to the specified structure member from the beginning of
       the structure.  It is normally used to statically initialize resource
       lists and is more portable than XtOffset, which serves the same func-
       tion.

       The XtNumber macro returns the number of elements in the specified ar-
       gument lists, resources lists, and other counted arrays.
