NAME

curl_share_init
- Create a shared object

SYNOPSIS

#include

CURLSH
*curl_share_init( );

DESCRIPTION

This function
returns a CURLSH handle to be used as input to all the other
share-functions, sometimes referred to as a share handle in
some places in the documentation. This init call MUST have a
corresponding call to curl_share_cleanup when all
operations using the share are complete.

This share
handle is what you pass to curl using the
CURLOPT_SHARE(3) option with
curl_easy_setopt(3), to make that specific curl
handle use the data in this share.

RETURN VALUE

If this
function returns NULL, something went wrong (out of memory,
etc.) and therefore the share object was not created.
