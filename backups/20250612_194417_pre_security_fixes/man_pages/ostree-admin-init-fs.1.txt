NAME

ostree-admin-init-fs
- Initialize a new root filesystem

SYNOPSIS

ostree admin init-fs
[OPTIONS...] {PATH}

DESCRIPTION

Initialize an
empty physical root filesystem in the designated PATH, with
normal toplevels and correct permissions for each directory.
Primarily useful for operating system installers.

OPTIONS

--modern

Equivalent to --epoch=1.

--epoch

This accepts an integer value
in the range [0-1], inclusive. The default is zero for
compatibility.

When set to 1,
the command will skip adding a number of toplevel "API
filesystems" such as /proc to the toplevel of the
physical root. These should be unnecessary, as they should
only be mounted in the final deployment root. The main
exception is /boot, which may need to be mounted in some
setups before the target root.

Epoch 2 is the
same as 1, except that the toplevel ostree directory is mode
0700, denying access from unprivileged code. This is a new
recommended best practice as it avoids access to old
configuration files in /etc in previous deployments, as well
as potentially old setuid binaries in /ostree/repo.

EXAMPLE

$ mkdir
/example

$ ostree
admin init-fs --epoch=1 /example

$ ls
/example

boot
