SYNOPSIS

pcdovtoppm
[-m width] [-s size] [-a
across] [-c colors] [-f
font] [-b|-w] [pcdfile]

DESCRIPTION

This program is
part of Netpbm(1).

This program
generates an index image in PPM format for a photo CD, based
on the photo CD overview file.

You can achieve
a similar result with hpcdtoppm -Overview followed by
pnmindex -black on the generated PPM images.

OPTIONS

In addition to
the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most
notably -quiet, see
 Common Options ),
pcdovtoppm recognizes the following command line
options: 
-wwidth

Maximum width of the result
image (default: 1152).

-ssize

Maximum size of each of the images (default: 192).

-aacross

Maximum number of images across
(default: 6).

-ccolors

Maximum number of colors, or
n

to mean no
quantization

-ffont

Font to be used for annotation (default: internal
font). 

-b

Black background color (default).

-w

White background color.

The Netpbm
common options -version, -plain and
-quiet were implemented starting with Netpbm 10.91
(June 2020). Before that, none of these options were
valid.
