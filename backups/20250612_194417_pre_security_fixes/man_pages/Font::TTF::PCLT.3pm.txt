NAME
       Font::TTF::PCLT - PCLT TrueType font table

DESCRIPTION
       The PCLT table holds various pieces HP-PCL specific information.
       Information here is generally not used by other software, except for
       the xHeight and CapHeight which are stored here (if the table exists in
       a font).

INSTANCE VARIABLES
       Only from table and the standard:

           version
           FontNumber
           Pitch
           xHeight
           Style
           TypeFamily
           CapHeight
           SymbolSet
           Typeface
           CharacterComplement
           FileName
           StrokeWeight
           WidthType
           SerifStyle

       Notice that "Typeface", "CharacterComplement" and "FileName" return
       arrays of unsigned characters of the appropriate length

METHODS
   $t->read
       Reads the table into memory thanks to some utility functions

   $t->out($fh)
       Writes the table to a file either from memory or by copying.

   $t->minsize()
       Returns the minimum size this table can be. If it is smaller than this,
       then the table must be bad and should be deleted or whatever.
