NAME

slapo-dynlist -
Dynamic List overlay to slapd

SYNOPSIS

/etc/ldap/slapd.conf

DESCRIPTION

The
dynlist overlay to slapd(8) allows expansion
of dynamic lists and groups. Any time an entry with a
specific objectClass (defined in the overlay configuration)
is being returned, the LDAP URI-valued occurrences of a
specific attribute (also defined in the overlay
configuration) are expanded into the corresponding
entries.

For a dynamic
list, the values of the attributes listed in the URI are
added from the matching entries to the original entry. No
recursion is allowed, to avoid potential infinite loops. The
resulting entry must comply with the LDAP data model, so
constraints are enforced. For example, if a
SINGLE-VALUE attribute is listed, only the first
value found during the list expansion appears in the final
entry.

For a dynamic
group, the DNs of the matching entries are added to a member
attribute in the original entry.

All dynamic
behavior is disabled when the manageDSAit control
(RFC 3296) is used. In that case, the contents of the
original entry is returned; namely, the URLs are returned
instead of being expanded.

CONFIGURATION

The config
directives that are specific to the dynlist overlay
must be prefixed by dynlist-, to avoid potential
conflicts with directives specific to the underlying
database or to other stacked overlays. 
overlay dynlist

This directive adds the dynlist
overlay to the current database, or to the frontend, if used
before any database instantiation; see slapd.conf(5)
for details.

This
slapd.conf configuration option is defined for the
dynlist overlay. It may have multiple occurrences, and it
must appear after the overlay directive. 
dynlist-attrset  []
 [options]

The value
group-oc is the name of the objectClass that triggers
the dynamic expansion of the data.

The optional
URI restricts expansion only to entries matching the
DN, the scope and the filter portions
of the URI.

The value
URL-ad is the name of the attributeDescription that
contains the URI that is expanded by the overlay; if none is
present, no expansion occurs. If the intersection of the
attributes requested by the search operation (or the
asserted attribute for compares) and the attributes listed
in the URI is empty, no expansion occurs for that specific
URI. It must be a subtype of labeledURI.

The remaining
options depend on whether a dynamic list or a dynamic group
is being configured.

For a dynamic
list, the allowed options have the form

[:
...]

The
mapped-ad can be used to remap attributes obtained
through expansion. The list-ad must be one of the
attributes returned in the expansion of the URIs in the
URL-ad attribute of the dynamic entry. Multiple
mapping statements can be used. Note that in order for
dynamic lists to be usable in a search filter, the dynamic
attributes to be filtered must be explicitly mapped. They
can be mapped to themselves if no transformation is
required.

For a dynamic
group, the allowed options are

[+[@[*]]]

The
member-ad is required; this attribute will list the
DN of the entries resulting from the internal search. In
this case, the attrs portion of the URIs in the
URL-ad attribute must be absent, and the DNs
of all the entries resulting from the expansion of the URIs
are listed as values of this attribute. Compares that assert
the value of the member-ad attribute of entries with
group-oc objectClass apply as if the DN of the
entries resulting from the expansion of the URI were present
in the group-oc entry as values of the
member-ad attribute. If the optional
memberOf-ad attribute is also specified, then it will
be populated with the DNs of the dynamic groups that an
entry is a member of. If the optional static-oc
objectClass is also specified, then the memberOf attribute
will also be populated with the DNs of the static groups
that an entry is a member of. If the optional *
character is also specified, then the member and memberOf
values will be populated recursively, for nested groups.
Note that currently nesting is only supported for Search
operations, not Compares.

dynlist-simple TRUE |
FALSE

This option downgrades to the
behavior of the OpenLDAP 2.4 dynlist overlay. It disables
memberOf processing, nested group support, and filter
evaluation of dynamically generated values. The default is
FALSE.

The dynlist
overlay may be used with any backend, but it is mainly
intended for use with local storage backends. In case the
URI expansion is very resource-intensive and occurs
frequently with well-defined patterns, one should consider
adding a proxycache later on in the overlay stack.

AUTHORIZATION

By default the
expansions are performed using the identity of the current
LDAP user. This identity may be overridden by setting the
dgIdentity attribute in the group’s entry to
the DN of another LDAP user. In that case the dgIdentity
will be used when expanding the URIs in the object. Setting
the dgIdentity to a zero-length string will cause the
expansions to be performed anonymously. Note that the
dgIdentity attribute is defined in the dyngroup
schema, and this schema must be loaded before the dgIdentity
authorization feature may be used. If the dgAuthz
attribute is also present in the group’s entry, its
values are used to determine what identities are authorized
to use the dgIdentity to expand the group. Values of
the dgAuthz attribute must conform to the
(experimental) OpenLDAP authz syntax. When using
dynamic memberOf in search filters, search access to the
entryDN pseudo-attribute is required.

EXAMPLE

This example
collects all the email addresses of a database into a single
entry; first of all, make sure that slapd.conf contains the
directives:

include
/path/to/dyngroup.schema 
# ...

database

# ...

overlay dynlist

dynlist-attrset groupOfURLs memberURL

and that slapd
loads dynlist.la, if compiled as a run-time module; then add
to the database an entry like

dn: cn=Dynamic
List,ou=Groups,dc=example,dc=com 
objectClass: groupOfURLs 
cn: Dynamic List 
memberURL:
ldap:///ou=People,dc=example,dc=com?mail?sub?(objectClass=person)

If no
 are provided in the URI, all (non-operational)
attributes are collected.

The values of
the above list can not be evaluated in a search filter. To
enable filter evaluation on the dynamic list, the
configuration must be changed to explicitly map the dynamic
attributes to be filtered. In this case mail is just
mapped to itself.

include
/path/to/dyngroup.schema 
# ...

database

# ...

overlay dynlist

dynlist-attrset groupOfURLs memberURL mail:mail

This example
implements the dynamic group feature on the member
attribute:

include
/path/to/dyngroup.schema 
# ...

database

# ...

overlay dynlist

dynlist-attrset groupOfURLs memberURL member

A dynamic group
with dgIdentity authorization could be created with an entry
like

dn: cn=Dynamic
Group,ou=Groups,dc=example,dc=com 
objectClass: groupOfURLs 
objectClass: dgIdentityAux 
cn: Dynamic Group 
memberURL:
ldap:///ou=People,dc=example,dc=com??sub?(objectClass=person)

dgIdentity: cn=Group Proxy,ou=Services,dc=example,dc=com

This example
extends the dynamic group feature to add a dynamic
dgMemberOf attribute to all the members of a dynamic
group:

include
/path/to/dyngroup.schema 
# ...

database

# ...

overlay dynlist

dynlist-attrset groupOfURLs memberURL member+dgMemberOf

This example
extends the dynamic memberOf feature to add the
memberOf attribute to all the members of both static
and dynamic groups:

include
/path/to/dyngroup.schema 
# ...

database

# ...

overlay dynlist

dynlist-attrset groupOfURLs memberURL
member+memberOf@groupOfNames

This dynamic
memberOf feature can fully replace the functionality of the
slapo-memberof(5) overlay.

BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY

The dynlist
overlay has been reworked with the 2.5 release to use a
consistent namespace as with other overlays. As a
side-effect the following cn=config parameters are
deprecated and will be removed in a future release:
olcDlAttrSet is replaced with olcDynListAttrSet
olcDynamicList is replaced with olcDynListConfig

SEE ALSO

slapd.conf(5),
slapd-config(5), slapd(8). The
slapo-dynlist(5) overlay supports dynamic
configuration via back-config.

BUGS

Filtering on
dynamic groups may return incomplete results if the search
operation uses the pagedResults control.
