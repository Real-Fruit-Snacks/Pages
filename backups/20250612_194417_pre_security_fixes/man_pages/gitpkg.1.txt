NAME

gitpkg −
export a Debian source package from nominated git
revisions

SYNOPSIS

gitpkg
branch [origbranch]

DESCRIPTION

If
gitpkg is run in a git(1) repo with a single
’branch’ specified, then it will do a
git−archive export of that branch to the
DEB_DIR directory. If the package is Debian native it
will simply create a source package from it. If the package
has a Debian version, then an orig tarball will be expected
to already exist for it. If an orig tarball does not already
exist then what happens next depends on the value of the
gitpkg.create−fake−orig configuration
option (described below).

If
gitpkg is invoked with two branches specified, then
the first branch will be exported as the unpacked complete
source, while the second branch will be exported for the
orig.tar.gz. This allows all local changes to the source to
be recorded in the resulting diff.gz if a pristine upstream
branch exists in the repository. If an orig tarball already
exists for the version at ’branch’ then what
happens next depends on the value of the
gitpkg.force−overwrite−orig configuration
option (described below).

The
’branch’ should always have a
debian/ dir and may be any tree-ish object
that is accepted by git−archive(1). The
’origbranch’, if supplied, should usually
not have a debian/ dir.

CONFIGURATION OPTIONS

Almost all
gitpkg configuration is handled using
git−config(1) now. The following configuration
options are supported: 
gitpkg.deb−dir

May be set to override the
default destination directory for exported packages. Default
is ’../deb−packages’. Available to
hook scripts as DEB_DIR. This may be overridden on
the command line with the
−−deb−dir=path option.

gitpkg.build−rootcmd

May be set to override the
default command used to get root for package build
operations. Default is ’fakeroot’.
Available to hook scripts as BUILD_ROOTCMD.

gitpkg.prebuild−target

May be set to a target or
targets from debian/rules which will be called after
the debian source tree is exported, but before the source
package is built. Some packages may use this to generate
autoconf files or the like, which should generally not be in
the repo, but which should be in the distributed package.
The target is invoked using the BUILD_ROOTCMD. A common use
for this hook would be to call the package’s
’clean’ target. This hook is unset by
default since gitpkg 0.18. Previous to that it defaulted to
the clean target. Available to hook scripts as
PREBUILD_TARGET.

gitpkg.orig−compressor

May be set to override the
default compression for an exported package.orig.tar.
Default is ’gzip’. For format 3.0
packages, valid values also include xz and
bzip2. Available to hook scripts as
ORIG_COMPRESSOR.

gitpkg.orig−compress−level

An optional compression level
to use with gitpkg.orig−compressor. 1 is
usually the fastest and 9 is usually the smallest, with the
precise details of everything between being up to the chosen
compressor. Default is unset (which will use whatever the
compressor default is). Available to hook scripts as
ORIG_COMPRESS_LEVEL.

gitpkg.orig−gz−opts

gitpkg.orig−xz−opts 
gitpkg.orig−bz2−opts

May be set to pass arbitrary
options verbatim to gzip, xz or bzip2
when compressing the orig tarball. If not specified
explicitly, gitpkg.orig−gz−opts will
default to include the −−no−name
option so that no timestamp is included in the resulting
file, making the output reproducible. No default options are
used for the other compressors. To pass multiple options to
a compressor you must set this option for it multiple times
(ie. using git config −−add for
each option to use).

gitpkg.deb−compressor

May be set to override the
default compression used by dpkg−source(1) for
exported packages. Default (if unset) is to use whatever
dpkg−source wants to use. For format 3.0
packages, valid values also include xz and
bzip2. Available to hook scripts as
DEB_COMPRESSOR.

gitpkg.deb−compress−level

An optional compression level
to use with gitpkg.deb−compressor. 1 is usually
the fastest and 9 is usually the smallest, with the precise
details of everything between being up to the chosen
compressor. Default is unset (which will use whatever the
dpkg−source default is, currently
’9’). Available to hook scripts as
DEB_COMPRESS_LEVEL.

gitpkg.dpkg−source

May be set to pass arbitrary
options verbatim to dpkg−source(1) when
building the source package. Use with caution and at your
own risk. To pass multiple options to
dpkg−source you must set this option multiple
times (ie. using
git config −−add for each
option) due to the otherwise amusing quoting requirements
for options such as
"−−format=3.0 (native)". Default
is empty. Available to hook scripts as the indexed array
DPKG_SOURCE_OPTS. Do not use this to set the
dpkg−source(1) −Z or
−z options, they should instead be set using
the deb−compressor and
deb−compress−level options respectively.
This may be overridden on the command line with the
−−dpkg−source=arg option,
which likewise must be passed multiple times to set multiple
options.

gitpkg.create−fake−orig

Sometimes both upstream source
and debian support really are intermingled into a single
branch of the repo but you’d still like to make a
’non-native’ package from it. gitpkg can
fake an orig tarball from such a tree out of everything but
the contents of the debian/ directory. Setting this option
to ’true’ makes that behaviour the default if a
single treeish is passed to gitpkg and no
corresponding orig tarball is found. Setting this option to
’false’ will make gitpkg fail, reporting
an error, if a single treeish is passed and no orig tarball
with the correct version already exists for it (and none was
retrieved by a hook script prior to it being needed). If
this option is unset then the user will be prompted for the
correct thing to do if this situation arises. Default is
unset. Available to hook scripts as
CREATE_FAKE_ORIG.

gitpkg.force−overwrite−orig

This option controls the
behaviour of gitpkg if an ’origbranch’
treeish is specified and the corresponding orig.tar for the
’branch’ already exists. If this is set to
’true’, then the orig.tar will be overwritten
with the repo source (to reuse an existing orig.tar simply
call gitpkg with only the single debian
’branch’ treeish you wish to export). If this is
set to ’false’, then it is a hard error to
attempt to export the upstream source again when the
orig.tar already exists, and gitpkg will terminate
and scold you if you try. If unset you will be prompted
about whether to overwrite it or not, and the build will
continue using whichever of the two you selected. Default is
unset. Available to hook scripts as
FORCE_OVERWRITE_ORIG.

gitpkg.keep−unpacked−source

This option controls whether or
not the unpacked source directory is kept after the package
export and exit hook have successfully completed. If this is
set to ’true’, the unpacked source will be
retained. If set to ’false’ or unset then that
directory will be removed as the final operation before
gitpkg exits if all prior operations completed
successfully. Default is unset. Available to hook scripts as
KEEP_UNPACKED_SOURCE. This may be overridden on the
command line with the
−−keep−unpacked−source=bool
option (where ’no’ or ’false’ will
not keep it, and any other value, including nothing,
will).

SCRIPT HOOKS

User defined
scripts can be invoked from a number of points during the
package build process. They are sourced into gitpkg
as bash shell snippets, in most cases in a subshell, so they
can read state variables and perform external actions, but
cannot alter the running configuration once a build is in
progress. If a hook returns with a non-zero status, then
gitpkg will be terminated. (Hooks that do terminate
gitpkg should take some care not to leave too much of a
mess, but also should leave enough clues intact for the user
to diagnose and fix whatever the problem was. Useful and
informative error messages should be barked to stderr before
exiting in this way.)

Hook scripts
may be installed on the host system outside of the repo
tree, or sourced from version controlled files in the repo
itself. Both methods have advantages and risks for different
use cases. Hook scripts are activated by the local admin, by
setting each relevant git−config(1) option with
the path to the script to be executed. Paths may be absolute
or relative to the directory which that hook is called from.
If a hook is set, the script must exist when it is
called. Care should be taken to only enable them for use by
trusted source trees when hooking into files in the repo
itself. Usually you should enable them on a per-repo basis
with git−config(1) rather than at a
−−global or −−system
level.

A brief
admonition against getting hooked: 
You should avoid complicated in-package hook arrangements
becoming essential for exporting your package source. If you
need them to create a particular package correctly, and need
strict version binding with the source being released, and
they aren’t useful to any other package at all ...
then you’re quite probably doing something, or several
things, quite wrong. Else you’re in such deep shit
working around some broken build system that you don’t
need me to tell you about it. Either way, local admin has to
enable your hooks before they can run, so if you want to be
friendly to others (and yourself), then keep the
’normal’ packaging work strictly inside the
usual package building tools, and leave the gitpkg hooks
free for other local admins to wrap whatever automation it
is they need around things. If a particular version
of the package source needs some particular actions
performed on it prior to the first source package build,
then the PREBUILD_TARGET option from above is most
probably what you want rather than one of these hooks. Other
people can use that again later without needing to have
gitpkg around. The aim is for this to Help You. For some
values of All Of You. So do be careful to avoid letting it
screw other people over if the hook isn’t called,
and/or let them know what they need to do instead if it
isn’t. Ok then, there’s the barb to watch out
for, so back to the point again:

Hook
points 
The available hook points are listed below in roughly the
order that they would usually be invoked: 
gitpkg.package−config−hook

This hook runs in the top level
directory of the repo gitpkg was invoked in, prior to
any operations taking place, with all
git−config(1) sourced options available to it.
No detailed information about the package itself is
available in the hook environment yet, not even its name or
version, only the tree-ish(es) that gitpkg was passed
by the user, but the hook may run its own self-checks based
on the current (possibly ’dirty’) contents of
the working tree that gitpkg was invoked in.

This hook is
able to modify the gitpkg configuration variables for
subsequent operations. It can perform operations on the repo
if needed, but since it needs to be committed to the repo
before it will ever be called, that may not be so useful
here in practice. Basically, it can do anything it pleases,
it’s just a shell script, nothing else has really
begun yet, and it has been sourced into the topmost shell
level of gitpkg.

Its operation
is different from the admin−config−hook
in only one respect, the path to this hook must be
relative to the TLD of the repo, and the revision of the
file that will be sourced is checked out from the
’branch’ tree-ish that gitpkg was
requested to export. The file must exist in that version at
the path given.

Available to
hook scripts as PACKAGE_CONFIG_HOOK.

gitpkg.admin−config−hook

This hook is run after the
package−config−hook returns, and differs
from it in operation only by reading a static file from the
current filesystem rather than extracting a version
controlled one from the repo being exported.

This can be
used by the local admin to override any package specific
options, that may have been set by the
package−config−hook, with site specific
configuration. This is a policy control, not a security one.
Security was all over when you let the
package−config−hook run, this just lets
you override it without having to fake up a new commit
changing the package hook.

This is the
last hook to run that is able to modify the gitpkg
configuration and set environment options that will be
visible to later hooks. Available to hook scripts as
ADMIN_CONFIG_HOOK. This may be overridden on the
command line with the
−−admin−config−hook=path
option.

gitpkg.pre−export−hook

This hook runs in the top level
directory of the repo, after the package name and version
have been determined, and with the final package
configuration including any tweaking by the previous hooks.
It cannot alter any configuration options, only act upon
them or terminate gitpkg.

This can be
used to do things like invoke pristine−tar or prefetch
an existing orig tarball from some foreign source. It may
perform operations on the repo if any such are desired, or
any other last minute check that needs to be done before we
actually get about the task of exporting the source we want
packaged.

Available to
hook scripts as PRE_EXPORT_HOOK.

gitpkg.deb−export−hook

This hook runs in the top level
directory of the exported debian source, immediately after
the source has been exported from the requested
tree-ish, and immediately prior to the
PREBUILD_TARGET being invoked (if provided). It
cannot alter any configuration options, only act upon them
or terminate gitpkg. If this hook terminates
gitpkg, the exported source directory will be left on
the system for the user to inspect. Subsequent invocations
of gitpkg for the same release version will overwrite
it though. Available to hook scripts as
DEB_EXPORT_HOOK.

gitpkg.orig−export−hook

This hook runs in the top level
directory of the exported ’upstream’ source,
immediately after the source has been exported from the
provided tree-ish, and prior to it being compressed
into a tarball. It cannot alter any configuration options,
only act upon them or terminate gitpkg. If this hook
terminates gitpkg, the exported source directory will
be left on the system for the user to inspect. Subsequent
invocations of gitpkg for the same release version
will overwrite it though.

This hook is
only invoked if the upstream ’origbranch’
actually is exported from the repository. If an existing
orig.tar is found or has been created by some earlier hook
(and it is not being overwritten, see
force−overwrite−orig above), then the
operations this hook would perform are presumed to have
already happened for this tarball and it is skipped.

It is not safe
to assume that this hook will be executed before or after
deb−export−hook, and it may in fact be
run in parallel with it at some point in the future. They
both will be entered after
pre−export−hook returns, and
exit−hook will not begin until (at least) after
both have returned. What else happens in the middle of all
that we make no firm promises about at this stage.

Available to
hook scripts as ORIG_EXPORT_HOOK.

gitpkg.exit−hook

This hook runs in the directory
where the package .dsc was deposited by
dpkg−source(1), after all internal
gitpkg operations have successfully completed.
It’s too late to alter any configuration options, or
even to terminate gitpkg really. You can pretty much
do what you like from this one, anything that goes wrong
from here on is your own doing. Available to hook scripts as
EXIT_HOOK. This may be overridden on the command line
with the −−exit−hook=path
option.

Hook
Environment 
The following variables are made available for hook scripts,
in addition to those already listed as shadowing a
git−config option from above. Not all of them
are valid/useful at all hook points, see the hook
documentation above for the exceptions applying to specific
hooks. 
GITPKG_HOOK_API

Permits hook scripts to query
what interfaces are available to them. Has only two numeric
components separated by a ’.’ of which the
number to the right of point will get incremented every time
we add some new variable a hook might access, or add some
new knob it might tweak where existing interfaces have not
have changed. If we do screw up and need to change some
current interface, the number to the left will get bumped.
The current API version is 0.2

Available in
API version 0.1 
These variables have been available to hooks since gitpkg
version 0.13 
GITPKG_TREEISH

The user-passed debian
’branch’ tree-ish that gitpkg was invoked to
export.

GITPKG_ORIG_TREEISH

The ’origbranch’
tree-ish that gitpkg was invoked with. This will be empty if
only a single ’branch’ tree-ish was
specified.

DEB_SOURCE

The name of the source package
to create, without any versioning. As seen in the Source:
field of dpkg−parsechangelog(1).

DEB_VERSION

The version of the source
package to create, without any epoch. As seen in the name of
the .diff.gz and .dsc files.

UPSTREAM_VERSION

The version of the source
package to create, without any debian version. As seen in
the name of the orig tarball. For native packages this will
be the same as DEB_VERSION.

DEB_ORIG

The full versioned filename of
the orig tarball to use or create. This variable is empty
for native packages without a Debian version part.

DEB_DSC

The full filename of the
package .dsc that will be or has been created.

DEB_PACKAGE

The directory name of the
debianised source tree to pass to
dpkg−source(1).

REPO_DIR

An absolute path to the top
level directory of the git repo we are exporting from.
Usually, if you need to look out of the tree that you were
dropped in, you’re probably doing something (at the)
wrong (time), but there are exceptions, and being able to
query git−config options is one of them.
That’s mostly what this one is for right now. See the
repo−config−helper documented below. Be
careful if you do use it for much else.

Available in
API version 0.2 
These variables have been available to hooks since gitpkg
version 0.24 
GITPKG_AOPTS

An associative array containing
the command line options not parsed by gitpkg itself
which can be used to override the behaviour of a hook. The
array is keyed on the names of the options with the
’−−’ removed. If an option was
passed multiple times, only the last value passed will be
stored in this array. For example:

$ gitpkg
−−my−option=foo −−option2
−−opt=oops −−opt=’bar
baz’

Will give:

${GITPKG_AOPTS[my-option]}
= "foo" 
${GITPKG_AOPTS[option2]} = "" 
${GITPKG_AOPTS[opt]} = "bar baz"

GITPKG_IOPTS

An indexed array containing the
command line options not parsed by gitpkg itself
which can be used to override the behaviour of a hook. The
array contains the literal option strings passed and so can
be used to access options which are intended to be passed
multiple times. For example:

$ gitpkg
−−my−option=foo −−option2
−−opt=oops −−opt=’bar
baz’

Will give:

${GITPKG_IOPTS[0]}
= "−−my−option=foo" 
${GITPKG_IOPTS[1]} = "−−option2" 
${GITPKG_IOPTS[2]} = "−−opt=oops" 
${GITPKG_IOPTS[3]} = "−−opt=bar
baz"

The
extract_values_for_option function in
repo−config−helper (see below for details
of it) can be used to further parse this array to obtain all
the value(s) for a specific option.

Hook
Library 
There are some canned hook scripts for various tasks
available in /usr/share/gitpkg/hooks which currently
include: 
cowpoke−exit−hook

A simple exit hook which sends
the exported package off for building using
cowpoke(1). To enable it:

$ git config
gitpkg.exit−hook
/usr/share/gitpkg/hooks/cowpoke−exit−hook

Additional
git−config(1) configuration options: 

gitpkg−cowpoke−exit−hook.ask−first

If ’true’ prompt
for confirmation before calling cowpoke. Default is
to just go ahead and do it.

gitpkg−cowpoke−exit−hook.options

May include any other options
to pass verbatim to cowpoke. To pass multiple
options, set this multiple times, once for each option. This
may be overridden on the command line with the
−−cowpoke=arg option, which
likewise must be passed multiple times to set multiple
options.

dpkg−buildpackage−exit−hook

A simple exit hook to build
binary packages locally with
dpkg−buildpackage(1). To enable it:

$ git config
gitpkg.exit−hook
/usr/share/gitpkg/hooks/dpkg−buildpackage−exit−hook

Additional
git−config(1) configuration options: 

gitpkg−dpkg−buildpackage−exit−hook.ask−first

If ’true’ prompt
for confirmation before calling
dpkg−buildpackage. Default is to just do
it.

gitpkg−dpkg−buildpackage−exit−hook.options

May include any other options
to pass verbatim to dpkg−buildpackage. To pass
multiple options, set this multiple times, once for each
option. This may be overridden on the command line with the
−−dpkg−bp=arg option, which
likewise must be passed multiple times to set multiple
options.

gitpkg−dpkg−buildpackage−exit−hook.build−log

If set ’false’
don’t save a log of the build process, the default is
to record one.

pristine−tar−pre−export−hook

A hook to extract an orig
tarball using pristine−tar. Which orig to extract is
determined by the package version of the
’branch’ tree-ish. To enable it:

$ git config
gitpkg.pre−export−hook
/usr/share/gitpkg/hooks/pristine−tar−pre−export−hook

If a
pristine−tar branch is not found in the repo, then
gitpkg will be terminated.

quilt−patches−deb−export−hook

This hook reads a list of
revision ranges suitable for
git−format−patch(1) from the file
debian/source/git−patches, one per line, and
exports them to the debian/patches directory in a
form suitable for (format 3.0) quilt packages. It is not
required for creating such packages, but permits you to
separate out individual patches however you please from the
default single patch that is otherwise created by
dpkg−source.

To enable
it:

$ git config
gitpkg.deb−export−hook
/usr/share/gitpkg/hooks/quilt−patches−deb−export−hook

The contents of
debian/source/git−patches may include comments
(on any line beginning with a #), empty lines, and
expressions of a range of commits. The revision ranges may
include $DEB_VERSION, $UPSTREAM_VERSION,
$DEB_REF or $UPSTREAM_REF. The first pair will
be substituted with the version of the package being
exported, the second pair with those version strings after
mangling by sanitise_git_ref to remap them to a legal
git refname. Using the sanitised versions is to be
preferred in most cases. For example:

# Export all
commits between these two treeishes, 
# based on the version of the package being exported.

upstream/$UPSTREAM_REF..patches/$DEB_REF

debcherry−deb−export−hook

This hook invokes
git−debcherry(1) to find and export patches to
the upstream source in a form suitable for use with (format
3.0) quilt packages. It allows for a more natural (and
automatic) workflow than the quilt−patches hook above
by searching for patches made to the packaging branch that
have not yet been applied upstream.

To enable
it:

$ git config
gitpkg.deb−export−hook
/usr/share/gitpkg/hooks/debcherry−deb−export−hook

In order to use
this hook, a ${DEB_ORIG}.commit file must be created
which contains the treeish of the exported upstream source
in the repository. This will be created automatically (if
this hook is enabled) when you export an upstream tarball by
passing both branch and origbranch to
gitpkg, or if you use the
pristine−tar−pre−export−hook,
which determines an appropriate commit corresponding to the
tarball. If your upstream tarball is created using some
other mechanism you will need to ensure that file is created
yourself.

If using this
hook, you may wish to document that in your repository with
something similar to the text in
/usr/share/doc/gitpkg/examples/README.debcherry−export
as a convenience to other users. Your package will still be
exportable without this hook enabled, it just won’t
have the upstream patches individually separated out into a
quilt series.

Hook Library
Helpers 
These are even more trivial snippets, for operations which
may be shared by several scripts. Also found in
/usr/share/gitpkg/hooks. Usually these would be
sourced by other scripts rather than being hooked to
directly. 
repo−config−helper

Provides a simple wrapper
around ’git config’, which ensures it is
called from the repo tree where any repo-specific config
options may be stored. Useful to scripts which aren’t
called from inside the repo tree, but which do have
git−config options of their own to query.

Provides the
sanitise_git_ref shell function which remaps
character strings that are illegal to use in a git
refname.

Provides the
extract_values_for_option shell function which can be
used to extract an array of the values for a particular
option from GITPKG_IOPTS.

See the content
of that file itself for more detailed documentation on the
functions that it provides.

INTERACTIVIY

If you intend
to call gitpkg from your own scripts, then you should
note that there are two situations when it may prompt
interactively by default. There is no One True Sane Default
for these cases, so it’s better to just ask the user
and continue than to make them start the whole process again
in the likely case where they have called gitpkg
directly. For details, see the
gitpkg.force−overwrite−orig and
gitpkg.create−fake−orig config options
above. You should set both explicitly to the behaviour that
you desire from them if gitpkg should never become
interactive.

WORKFLOW

Though
gitpkg explicitly does not try to force any
particular workflow procedure upon you in order to make full
use of it, it probably is worth making quick mention of at
least one simple way to manage Debian packages in git.

One common repo
structure is to keep pristine upstream source on one branch,
which is updated either directly from an upstream repo or by
importing tar archives to it periodically, with the Debian
patched source on another branch. In this situation the task
of preparing a new upstream release from a tarball might
look a bit like this:

Check out the
upstream branch 
$ cd myrepo 
$ git checkout upstream

Remove all old
upstream files from the repo 
$ rm −rf $(all_files_except .git)

Unpack the new
tarball in their place 
$ tar zxf $new_upstream.tar.gz

Let git figure
out what is renamed/new/gone by itself. 
Make sure you don’t have things like vim .swp files
lurking 
in the tree still at this point. 
$ git add . 
$ git commit −a 
$ git tag v$upstream_version

Prepare the
Debian branch 
$ git checkout debian 
$ git merge upstream 
$ $(update changelog and other debian patches etc.) 
$ git commit −a 
$ git tag v${upstream_version}−$debian_version

Make a release

$ gitpkg v${upstream_version}−$debian_version
v$upstream_version 
$ cd ../deb−packages/mypackage &&
dpkg−buildpackage ...
