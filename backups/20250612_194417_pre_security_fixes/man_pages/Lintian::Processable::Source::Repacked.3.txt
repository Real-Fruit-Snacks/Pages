NAME
       Lintian::Processable::Source::Repacked - Lintian interface to source
       package data collection

SYNOPSIS
           my ($name, $type, $dir) = ('foobar', 'source', '/path/to/lab-entry');
           my $collect = Lintian::Processable::Source::Repacked->new($name);
           if ($collect->native) {
               print encode_utf8("Package is native\n");
           }

DESCRIPTION
       Lintian::Processable::Source::Repacked provides an interface to package
       data for source packages.  It implements data collection methods
       specific to source packages.

       This module is in its infancy.  Most of Lintian still reads all data
       from files in the laboratory whenever that data is needed and generates
       that data via collect scripts.  The goal is to eventually access all
       data about source packages via this module so that the module can cache
       data where appropriate and possibly retire collect scripts in favor of
       caching that data in memory.

INSTANCE METHODS
       repacked
           Returns true if the source package has been "repacked" and false
           otherwise.  This is determined from the version name containing
           "dfsg" or similar.
