DESCRIPTION

The lsb
package provides infrastructure for installing Linux

The Linux
Standard Base is a common runtime environment for
third-party packages. The goal of the LSB is to make it easy
to create binary packages that will run on any Linux
distribution. For more information on the standard, please
