           my $window;
           while ($window = $sfd->readwindow) {
              if (index($window, 'evil') > -1) {
                  if($window =~
                        m/software \s++ shall \s++
                          be \s++ used \s++ for \s++ good \s*+ ,?+ \s*+
                          not \s++ evil/xsim) {

DESCRIPTION
       Lintian::SlidingWindow provides a way of matching some pattern,
       including multi line pattern, without needing to fully load the file in
       memory.

CLASS METHODS
       new(HANDLE[, BLOCKSUB[, BLOCKSIZE]])
           Create a new sliding window by reading from a given HANDLE, which
           must be open for reading. Optionally run BLOCKSUB against each
           block. Note that BLOCKSUB should apply transform byte by byte and
           does not depend of context.

           Each window consists of up to two blocks of BLOCKSIZE characters.

INSTANCE METHODS
       readwindow
           Return a new block of sliding window. Return undef at end of file.

       "blocksize"
       blocknumber
       handle
       blocksub

DIAGNOSTICS
