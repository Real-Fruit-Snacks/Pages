NAME

pmErrStr,
pmErrStr_r - convert a PMAPI error code into a
string

C SYNOPSIS

#include

const char
*pmErrStr(int code); 
char *pmErrStr_r(int code, char
*buf, int buflen);

cc ...
-lpcp

DESCRIPTION

Translate an
error code into a text string, suitable for generating a
diagnostic message. The pmErrStr_r function does the
same, but stores the result in a user-supplied buffer
buf of length buflen, which should have room
for at least PM_MAXERRMSGLEN bytes.

By convention,
all error codes are negative. The small values are assumed
to be negated versions of the Unix error codes as defined in
 and the strings returned are as per
strerror(3). The larger, negative error codes are
Performance Metrics Application Programming Interface
(PMAPI) error conditions and pmErrStr(3) returns an
appropriate PMAPI error string, as determined by
code.

NOTES

pmErrStr
returns a pointer to a static buffer, so the returned value
is only valid until the next call to pmErrStr and
hence is not thread-safe. Multi-threaded applications should
use pmErrStr_r instead.
