DESCRIPTION

new, in
its default mode, produces a one-line-per-folder listing of
all folders which contain messages in the specified
sequences, or in the sequence(s) listed in the
profile entry “Unseen-Sequence”. Each
line consists of the folder name, the total number of
messages in the specified sequences, and a list of messages
derived from the .mh_sequence file. For example:

foo 11.* 40-50

bar 380. 760-772 824-828 
total 391.

The
’*’ on foo indicates that it is the current
folder. The last line shows the total number of messages in
the desired sequences.

new
crawls the folder hierarchy recursively to find all folders,
and prints them in lexicographic order. Override this
behavior by providing a foldersfile containing the
pre-sorted list of folders which new should check,
one per line.

In fnext
and fprev modes, new changes to the next or
previous matching folder, respectively.

In
unseen mode, new executes scan
sequences for each matching folder.
