NAME

pmtime -
time control server for Performance Co-Pilot

SYNOPSIS

pmtime
[-V?] [-p port]

DESCRIPTION

pmtime
is a graphical user interface for performance monitoring
applications using the PCP infrastructure and requiring
interactive time control.

pmtime
is not normally invoked directly by users. Rather, it is
more typical for it to be started by client applications
(e.g. pmchart(1), pmstat(1) or
pmval(1)).

There are two
modes of interacting with a pmtime process - live
host mode, and historical archive mode. In archive mode the
window presents time controls suitable for manipulating the
archive position, allowing full VCR control to move forwards
and backwards in time at configurable rates and intervals.
In live mode the pmtime window contains the simpler
time controls suitable for live monitoring.

Note that the
pmtime window is only made visible when explicitly
requested. Multiple client applications can be connected to
a single pmtime server - when the final client
application exits, pmtime will also exit.

OPTIONS

The available
command line options are: 
-p port, --guiport=port

port is the port number
which pmtime will use for communication with its
clients (monitoring applications).

-V, --version

Display version number and
exit.

-?, --help

Display usage message and
exit.

ENVIRONMENT

When a port
number is not explicitly requested on the command line via
the -p option, the environment variable
PMTIME_PORT can be set to specify the port number
from which available-port probing will commence when
pmtime is searching for a port number to use.

The default
starting port number is 43334.
