Description

pic2graph
reads a pic(1) program from the standard input and
writes an image file, by default in Portable Network
Graphics (PNG) format, to the standard output. It
furthermore translates eqn(1) constructs, so it can
be used for generating images of mathematical formulae.

The input PIC
code should not be wrapped with the .PS and
.PE/.PF macros that normally guard it within
groff(1) documents.

Arguments not
recognized by pic2graph are passed to the ImageMagick
or GraphicsMagick program convert(1). By specifying
these, you can give your image a border, set the
image’s pixel density, or perform other useful
transformations.

The output
image is clipped using convert’s -trim
option to the smallest possible bounding box that contains
all the black pixels.

Options

--help
displays a usage message, while -v and
--version show version information; all exit
afterward. 
-eqn delimiters

Use delimiters as the
opening and closing characters that delimit eqn
directives; the default is “$$”. The option
argument delimiters should be a two-character string,
but an empty string ("") is accepted as a
directive to disable eqn processing.

-format output-format

Write the image in
output-format, which must be understood by
convert; the default is PNG.

-unsafe

Run groff in
unsafe mode, enabling the PIC command sh to
execute arbitrary Unix shell commands. The groff
default is to forbid this.

Environment

GROFF_TMPDIR

TMPDIR

TMP

TEMP

These environment variables are searched in the given
order to determine the directory where temporary files will
be created. If none are set, /tmp is used.
