NAME

INSERT −
create new rows in a table

SYNOPSIS

INSERT INTO
table [ ( column [, ...] ) ] 
{ DEFAULT VALUES | VALUES ( { expression | DEFAULT }
[, ...] ) | query }

DESCRIPTION

INSERT
allows one to insert new rows into a table. One can insert a
single row at a time or several rows as a result of a
query.

The columns in
the target list may be listed in any order. Each column not
present in the target list will be inserted using a default
value, either its declared default value or null.

If the
expression for each column is not of the correct data type,
automatic type conversion will be attempted.

You must have
INSERT privilege to a table in order to insert into it. If
you use the query clause to insert rows from a query,
you also need to have SELECT privilege on any table used in
the query.

PARAMETERS

table

The name (optionally
schema-qualified) of an existing table.

column

The name of a column in table.

DEFAULT VALUES

All columns will be filled with
their default values.

expression

An expression or value to
assign to column.

DEFAULT

This column will be filled with
its default value.

query

A query (SELECT statement) that supplies the rows
to be inserted. Refer to the SELECT statement for a
description of the syntax.

OUTPUTS

On successful
completion, an INSERT command returns a command tag
of the form

INSERT oid
count

The
count is the number of rows inserted. If count
is exactly one, and the target table has OIDs, then
oid is the OID assigned to the inserted row.
Otherwise oid is zero.

EXAMPLES

Insert a single
row into table films:

INSERT INTO
films VALUES 
(’UA502’, ’Bananas’, 105,
’1971-07-13’, ’Comedy’, ’82
minutes’);

In this second
example, the last column len is omitted and therefore it
will have the default value of null:

INSERT INTO
films (code, title, did, date_prod, kind) 
VALUES (’T_601’, ’Yojimbo’, 106,
’1961-06-16’, ’Drama’);

The third
example uses the DEFAULT clause for the date columns rather
than specifying a value:

INSERT INTO
films VALUES 
(’UA502’, ’Bananas’, 105, DEFAULT,
’Comedy’, ’82 minutes’); 
INSERT INTO films (code, title, did, date_prod, kind) 
VALUES (’T_601’, ’Yojimbo’, 106,
DEFAULT, ’Drama’);

This examples
inserts several rows into table films from table tmp:

INSERT INTO
films SELECT * FROM tmp;

This example
inserts into array columns:

-- Create an
empty 3x3 gameboard for noughts-and-crosses 
-- (all of these commands create the same board) 
INSERT INTO tictactoe (game, board[1:3][1:3]) 
VALUES
(1,’{{"","",""},{},{"",""}}’);

INSERT INTO tictactoe (game, board[3][3]) 
VALUES (2,’{}’); 
INSERT INTO tictactoe (game, board) 
VALUES (3,’{{,,},{,,},{,,}}’);

COMPATIBILITY

INSERT
conforms fully to the SQL standard. Possible limitations of
the query clause are documented under SELECT
[select(7)].
