NAME

config - The
SELinux sub-system configuration file.

DESCRIPTION

The SELinux
config file controls the state of SELinux
regarding:

1.

The policy enforcement status - enforcing,
permissive or disabled.

2.

The policy name or type that forms a path to the policy
to be loaded and its supporting configuration files.

3.

How SELinux-aware login applications should behave if no
valid SELinux users are configured.

4.

Whether the system is to be relabeled or not.

The entries
controlling these functions are described in the FILE
FORMAT section.

The fully
qualified path name of the SELinux configuration file is
/etc/selinux/config.

If the
config file is missing or corrupt, then no SELinux
policy is loaded (i.e. SELinux is disabled).

The
sestatus (8) command and the libselinux function
selinux_path (3) will return the location of the
config file.

FILE FORMAT

The
config file supports the following parameters:

SELINUX
= enforcing | permissive | disabled

SELINUXTYPE = policy_name 
REQUIRESEUSERS = 0 | 1 
AUTORELABEL = 0 | 1

Where: 
SELINUX

This entry can contain one of
three values:

enforcing

SELinux security policy is
enforced.

permissive

SELinux security policy is not
enforced but logs the warnings (i.e. the action is allowed
to proceed).

disabled

No SELinux policy is loaded.
This option was used to disable SELinux completely, which is
now deprecated. Use the selinux=0 kernel boot option
instead (see selinux(8)).

The entry can
be determined using the sestatus(8) command or
selinux_getenforcemode(3).

SELINUXTYPE

The policy_name entry is
used to identify the policy type, and becomes the directory
name of where the policy and its configuration files are
located.

The entry can
be determined using the sestatus(8) command or
selinux_getpolicytype(3).

The
policy_name is relative to a path that is defined
within the SELinux subsystem that can be retrieved by using
selinux_path(3). An example entry retrieved by
selinux_path(3) is:

/etc/selinux/

The
policy_name is then appended to this and becomes the
’policy root’ location that can be retrieved by
selinux_policy_root_path(3). An example entry
retrieved is:

/etc/selinux/targeted

The actual
binary policy is located relative to this directory and also
has a policy name pre-allocated. This information can be
retrieved using selinux_binary_policy_path(3). An
example entry retrieved by
selinux_binary_policy_path(3) is:

/etc/selinux/targeted/policy/policy

The binary
policy name has by convention the SELinux policy version
that it supports appended to it. The maximum policy version
supported by the kernel can be determined using the
sestatus(8) command or security_policyvers(3).
An example binary policy file with the version is:

/etc/selinux/targeted/policy/policy.24

REQUIRESEUSERS

This optional entry can be used
to fail a login if there is no matching or default entry in
the seusers(5) file or if the seusers file is
missing.

It is checked
by getseuserbyname(3) that is called by SELinux-aware
login applications such as PAM(8).

If set to
0 or the entry missing:

getseuserbyname(3) will
return the GNU / Linux user name as the SELinux user.

If set to
1:

getseuserbyname(3) will
fail.

The
getseuserbyname(3) man page should be consulted for
its use. The format of the seusers file is shown in
seusers(5).

AUTORELABEL

This is an optional entry that
allows the file system to be relabeled.

If set to
0 and there is a file called .autorelabel in
the root directory, then on a reboot, the loader will drop
to a shell where a root login is required. An administrator
can then manually relabel the file system.

If set to
1 or no entry present (the default) and there is a
.autorelabel file in the root directory, then the
file system will be automatically relabeled using
fixfiles -F restore

In both cases
the /.autorelabel file will be removed so that
relabeling is not done again.

EXAMPLE

This example
config file shows the minimum contents for a system
to run SELinux in enforcing mode, with a policy_name
of ’targeted’:

SELINUX =
enforcing 
SELINUXTYPE = targeted
