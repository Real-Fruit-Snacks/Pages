NAME

install-mh -
initialize the nmh environment

SYNOPSIS

/usr/lib/mh/install-mh 

[-help] [-version]
[-auto] [-check]

DESCRIPTION

install-mh
creates the initial setup for a first-time nmh user.
install-mh is installed in two locations for
historical reasons.

The
-auto switch does things as automatically as possible
and makes install-mh less chatty.

The user is
prompted for the name of the directory to be designated as
the user’s nmh directory. If this directory
does not exist, the user is asked if it should be created.
Normally, this directory should be under the user’s
home directory, and has the default name of
’Mail’. install-mh writes an
initial .mh_profile for the user.

As with all
nmh commands, install-mh first checks for the
existence of the $MH environment variable, since
that, if set, gives the profile path. If it isn’t set,
the $HOME environment variable is consulted to
determine the user’s home directory. If $HOME
is not set, then the /etc/passwd file is
consulted.

When creating
the user’s .mh_profile, install-mh will
check for the existence of a global profile at
/etc/nmh/mh.profile. If found, this will be used to
initialize the new .mh_profile.

The
-check switch checks if nmh is installed.
(This can be used by other programs to determine if
nmh has been installed.)

install-mh
sets up the user’s profile to support the
mh-draft(5) draft folder facility.

FILES

CONTEXT

With
-auto, the current folder is changed to
“inbox”.

UNDOING THE INSTALLATION

If you only ran
install-mh to try out nmh briefly, you might like to
remove the configuration files it creates. (This is not
obligatory -- install-mh creates only a few small
files so simply leaving them in place will not cause
problems.)

Most nmh
configuration information lives in the user’s
nmh directory; you can print its name by running

mhpath
+

Basically all
plain files in the nmh directory are configuration
files and can be removed.

Attention:
The nmh directory holds not just configuration files!
Its subdirectories contain all the emails you have written
or received with nmh. Don’t delete the
nmh directory without carefully checking that there
are no mail files that you might want later!

The only
configuration file that lives outside the nmh
directory is your profile file. You can print its name by
running

echo
${MH:-$HOME/.mh-profile}

If you
aren’t using nmh any more you can delete this file,
too.
