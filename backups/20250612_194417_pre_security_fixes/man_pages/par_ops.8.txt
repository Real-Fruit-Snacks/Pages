NAME

par_ops - basic
CPU operation parallelism

SYNOPSIS

par_ops
[ -W  ] [ -N
 ]

DESCRIPTION

par_ops
measures the available parallelism for basic CPU operations,
such as integer ADD. Results are reported as the average
operation latency divided by the minimum average operation
latency across all levels of parallelism. 
integer bit, add, mul, div, mod operations;

maximum parallelism for integer
XOR, ADD, MUL, DIV, MOD operations.

uint64 bit, add, mul, div, mod
operations;

maximum parallelism for uint64
XOR, ADD, MUL, DIV, MOD operations.

float add, mul, div
operations;

maximum parallelism for flot
ADD, MUL, DIV operations.

double add, mul, div
operations;

maximum parallelism for flot
ADD, MUL, DIV operations.

BUGS

This benchmark
is highly experimental and may sometimes (frequently?) give
erroneous results.
