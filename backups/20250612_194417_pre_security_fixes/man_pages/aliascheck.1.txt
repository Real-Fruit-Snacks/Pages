NAME

aliascheck
− check for existence of mail alias

SYNOPSIS

aliascheck
[−−nopwd] name [alias-file]

aliascheck
−−map [−−case] name
map-file

aliascheck
−−qmail [−−nopwd] name
[alias-user]

DESCRIPTION

aliascheck
checks whether name is a valid email alias or a user
in the password file. It converts name to lower-case
before performing any of the checks. If the alias or user
exists, aliascheck exits with status 0 and outputs what the
address resolves to. If the alias does not exist, aliascheck
exits with status 1. If aliascheck cannot determine the
validity of name because of some system error, it
exits with status 2.

aliascheck can
run in three different modes--sendmail alias mode (the
default), sendmail map mode, and qmail mode. In sendmail
alias mode the second argument, alias-file, is the
name of the sendmail alias file, typically
/etc/mail/aliases.db. If no second argument is
supplied, aliascheck first checks for the existence of
/etc/mail/aliases.db, then for the existence of
/etc/aliases.db, then finally exits with status 2 if
neither file exists. When an alias is found, aliascheck
outputs the value of that alias in the alias database.

When aliascheck
is invoked with −−map, it looks up
name in map-file, which should be a database
created with sendmail’s makemap(8) utility.
Note that maps have a slightly different and incompatible
format from that of alias files. Use the
−−case argument to prevent name
from being folded to lower-case before it is looked up in
the database. Note that −−map implies the
−−nopwd option.

When aliascheck
is given the argument −−qmail, it runs in
qmail mode. In this case, the second argument,
alias-user, specifies the user under which qmail
processes mail aliases. aliascheck will check this
user’s home directory for files named
.qmail−XXX for various appropriate suffixes
XXX . On success, it outputs the full
pathname of the appropriate file.

If aliascheck
cannot find an alias, it also checks the password file, and
exits 0 if it can find name there. If name is
found, aliascheck also outputs name (in lower-case)
to standard output before exiting. (This is useful for Mail
Avenger, because asmtpd does not recognize users with
invalid shells or UID 0, while MTAs typically
do.) To suppress password file checking, supply the
−−nopwd argument to aliascheck.

EXAMPLES

If you are
using Mail Avenger in conjunction with a sendmail
installation, you might want to put the following code in
your /etc/avenger/unknown file to reject mail for
unknown users who do not show up in the alias file.

    aliascheck "$RECIPIENT_LOCAL" /etc/mail/aliases.db > /dev/null
    case "$?" in
        0)
            # Fall through to default checks
            ;;
        1)
            reject unknown user
            ;;
        *)
            # Probably safest to do nothing, but could also
            # defer the mail with the following command:
            #
            #defer Temporary error processing alias file
            ;;
    esac

If you have
qmail instead of sendmail, assuming the qmail alias
user is called "alias", you would change
the first line in the previous example to:

    aliascheck −−qmail "$RECIPIENT_LOCAL" alias > /dev/null

FILES

/etc/avenger/unknown

Mail Avenger rules for local
email addresses that do not correspond to local users, or
correspond to local users without valid shells, or local
users with uid 0 (i.e., root). Note the location may be
different if you set EtcDir in your
asmtpd.conf file.

/etc/mail/aliases.db 
/etc/aliases.db

Default locations of sendmail
alias file

/etc/mail/virtusertable.db

Default location of the
sendmail virtual user table map, when this feature is in
use.

~alias/.qmail−*

Default locations of qmail
alias files

/etc/password

System password file. (Note,
however, that aliascheck uses the getpwnam function,
and will thus be compatible with schemes such as
NIS that do not keep all users in the local
password file.)

BUGS

aliascheck
doesn’t necessarily know how to parse the particular
database format your sendmail installation uses for aliases.
Make sure you test it before using it in an avenger
script.

In some
sendmail installations, the alias database is not world
readable, which can obviously prevent aliascheck from
working properly if run under the wrong user identity (such
as the AvengerUser).

It is quite
possible for aliascheck to return a system error (exit code
2), particularly if you run it while you are rebuilding a
large alias database. (aliascheck checks for the existence
of special key "@" in the database.) Make
sure you differentiate between error code 1 (no user) and
error code 2 (system error).

aliascheck may
not do the right thing if you installed qmail with
conf-break set to a character other than
"−".

Remember that
aliascheck does not read your qmail users/assign or
users/cdb files--it only checks for .qmail
files in the alias user’s home directory.
