largefile
âˆ’ large file status of utilities

DESCRIPTION

A large
file is a regular file whose size is greater than or
equal to 2 Gbyte ( 2**31 bytes). A small file is a
regular file whose size is less than 2 Gbyte.

Large file
aware utilities 
A utility is called large file aware if it can
process large files in the same manner as it does small
files. A utility that is large file aware is able to handle
large files as input and generate as output large files that
are being processed. The exception is where additional files
are used as system configuration files or support files that
can augment the processing. For example, the file
utility supports the -m option for an alternative
"magic" file and the -f option for a
support file that can contain a list of file names. It is
unspecified whether a utility that is large file aware will
accept configuration or support files that are large files.
If a large file aware utility does not accept configuration
or support files that are large files, it will cause no data
loss or corruption upon encountering such files and will
return an appropriate error.

Gbyte on a 32-bit operating system.

The following
/usr/ucb utilities are large file aware:

The
/usr/bin/cpio and /usr/bin/pax utilities are
large file aware, but cannot archive a file whose size
exceeds 8 Gbyte - 1 byte.

The
/usr/sbin/crash and /usr/bin/truss utilities
have been modified to read a dump file and display
information relevant to large files, such as offsets.

Large file
safe utilities 
A utility is called large file safe if it causes no
data loss or corruption when it encounters a large file. A
utility that is large file safe is unable to process
properly a large file, but returns an appropriate error.
