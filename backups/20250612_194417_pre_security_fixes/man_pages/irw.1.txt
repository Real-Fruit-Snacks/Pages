NAME

irw -
Send data from Unix domain socket to stdout

SYNOPSIS

irw
[socket]

DESCRIPTION

irw will
connect to any Unix domain socket and print the received
data to stdout. Without a socket argument it will
watch /var/run/lirc/lircd. Useful for debugging.

Options:

-h --help

-v --version

SIGNALS

On receiving
SIGUSR1 irw makes a clean exit.

EXAMPLE

Dumping the
default socket while pressing one button:

myhost $ irw

0000000000f40bf0 00 KEY_POWER ANIMAX 
0000000000f40bf0 01 KEY_POWER ANIMAX 
0000000000f40bf0 02 KEY_POWER ANIMAX 
0000000000f40bf0 03 KEY_POWER ANIMAX 
0000000000f40bf0 04 KEY_POWER ANIMAX 
0000000000f40bf0 05 KEY_POWER ANIMAX 
^C 
myhost $

Note that the
second counter is incremented for each new event generated

by the single key press. This is important for correct lircd
operation.

NOTES

Since the lircd
socket supports multiple clients, irw can run in
parallel with other applications.

irw does
nothing more than dumps a unix-domain socket, a task which
many standard tools also can do. E. g., the ncat(1) tool can
be used instead of irw to provide more flexibility (but
without a sane default socket): 
ncat -U /var/run/lirc/lircd
