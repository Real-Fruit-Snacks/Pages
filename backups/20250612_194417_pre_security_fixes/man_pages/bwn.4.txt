BWN(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual BWN(4)

NAME

bwn — Broadcom
BCM43xx SoftMAC IEEE 802.11 wireless network driver

SYNOPSIS

To compile this driver into the
kernel, add the following lines to the kernel configuration
file:

device bwn

device bhnd 
device bhndb 
device bhndb_pci 
device bcma 
device siba 
device gpio 
device wlan 
device wlan_amrr 
device firmware

To load the
driver as a module at boot, add the following lines to
loader.conf(5):

if_bwn_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION

The bwn driver provides
support for Broadcom BCM43xx based PCI/CardBus network
adapters.

It supports
station and monitor mode operation. Only one
virtual interface may be configured at any time. For more
information on configuring this device, see ifconfig(8).

This driver
requires firmware to be loaded before it will work. The
ports/net/bwn-firmware-kmod port needs to be
installed before ifconfig(8) will work. In most cases the
bwn_v4_ucode kernel module from the port should be
used. However, if an LP (low power) PHY is being used, the
bwn_v4_lp_ucode module should be used.

HARDWARE

The bwn driver supports
Broadcom BCM43xx based wireless devices, including:

Card Chip
Bus Standard 
Apple Airport Extreme BCM4318 PCI b/g 
ASUS WL-138g BCM4318 PCI b/g 
Buffalo WLI-CB-G54S BCM4318 CardBus b/g 
Dell Wireless 1390 BCM4311 Mini PCI b/g 
Dell Wireless 1470 BCM4318 Mini PCI b/g 
Dell Truemobile 1400 BCM4309 Mini PCI b/g 
HP Compaq 6715b BCM4312 PCI b/g 
HP nx6125 BCM4319 PCI b/g 
Linksys WPC54G Ver 3 BCM4318 CardBus b/g 
Linksys WPC54GS Ver 2 BCM4318 CardBus b/g 
US Robotics 5411 BCM4318 CardBus b/g

Users of older
Broadcom chipsets (BCM4301, BCM4303 and BCM4306 rev 2) must
use bwi(4) because the v4 version of the firmware does not
support these chips. The newer firmware is too big to fit
into these old chips.

EXAMPLES

Join an existing BSS network
(i.e., connect to an access point):

ifconfig wlan
create wlandev bwn0 inet 192.168.0.20 \ 
netmask 0xffffff00

Join a specific
BSS network with network name
’’my_net’’:

ifconfig wlan
create wlandev bwn0 ssid my_net up

Join a specific
BSS network with 64-bit WEP encryption:

ifconfig wlan
create wlandev bwn0 ssid my_net \ 
wepmode on wepkey 0x1234567890 weptxkey 1 up

LOADER TUNABLES

Tunables can be set at the
loader(8) prompt before booting the kernel or stored in
loader.conf(5).

hw.bwn.usedma

This tunable enables DMA
operations on the hardware. If the value is 0, PIO mode
would be used. The default value is 1.

HISTORY

The bwn driver first
appeared in FreeBSD 8.1. The driver was updated to
support the common Broadcom bhnd(4) bus interface in
FreeBSD 12.0.

AUTHORS

The bwn driver was
written by Weongyo Jeong weongyo [AT] FreeBSD.org>.
Support for bhnd(4) was added by Landon Fuller
landonf [AT] FreeBSD.org>.

CAVEATS

Some LP PHY devices have DMA
operation problems that in that case try to use PIO
mode.
