TL(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual TL(4)

NAME

tl — Texas
Instruments ThunderLAN Ethernet device driver

SYNOPSIS

To compile this driver into the
kernel, place the following lines in your kernel
configuration file:

device
miibus 
device tl

Alternatively,
to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following line in loader.conf(5):

if_tl_load="YES"

DEPRECATION NOTICE

The tl driver is not
present in FreeBSD 13.0 and later. See
https://github.com/freebsd/fcp/blob/master/fcp-0101.md for
more information.

DESCRIPTION

The tl driver provides
support for PCI Ethernet adapters based on the Texas
Instruments ThunderLAN Ethernet controller chip.

The ThunderLAN
controller has a standard MII interface that supports up to
32 physical interface devices (PHYs). It also has a built-in
10baseT PHY hardwired at MII address 31, which may be used
in some 10Mbps-only hardware configurations. In 100Mbps
configurations, a National Semiconductor DP83840A or other
MII-compliant PHY may be attached to the ThunderLAN’s
MII bus. If a DP83840A or equivalent is available, the
ThunderLAN chip can operate at either 100Mbps or 10Mbps in
either half-duplex or full-duplex modes. The
ThunderLAN’s built-in PHY and the DP83840A also
support autonegotiation.

The tl
driver supports the following media types:

autoselect

Enable
autoselection of the media type and options. Note that this
option is only available on those PHYs that support
autonegotiation. Also, the PHY will not advertise those
modes that have been explicitly disabled using the following
media options.

10baseT/UTP

Set 10Mbps
operation.

100baseTX

Set 100Mbps
(Fast Ethernet) operation.

10base5/AUI

Enable AUI/BNC
interface (useful only with the built-in PHY).

The tl
driver supports the following media options:

full-duplex

Force full
duplex operation.

half-duplex

Force half
duplex operation.

hw-loopback

Enable hardware
loopback mode.

Note that the
100baseTX media type is only available if supported by the
PHY. For more information on configuring this device, see
ifconfig(8).

DIAGNOSTICS

tl%d: couldn’t map
memory  A fatal initialization error has
occurred.

tl%d:
couldn’t map interrupt  A fatal
initialization error has occurred.

tl%d: device
timeout  The device has stopped responding to the
network, or there is a problem with the network connection
(cable).

tl%d: no
memory for rx list  The driver failed to allocate
an mbuf for the receiver ring.

tl%d: no
memory for tx list  The driver failed to allocate
an mbuf for the transmitter ring when allocating a pad
buffer or collapsing an mbuf chain into a cluster.
